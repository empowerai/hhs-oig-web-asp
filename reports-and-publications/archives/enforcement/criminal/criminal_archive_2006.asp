<h3>Durable Medical Equipment</h3>
<p>In Texas, the owner of a durable medical equipment (DME) company was sentenced to 63 months in prison and ordered to pay $669,000 in restitution for conspiracy and health care fraud. The man fraudulently billed Medicare for motorized wheelchairs and accessories, and alternating pressure mattresses. Beneficiaries either did not receive any equipment at all or were provided with a less expensive item. In addition, the man paid recruiters between $200 and $500 for beneficiary's personal information.</p>


<h3>Practitioners</h3>
<p>In Ohio, a podiatrist was sentenced to 78 months incarceration and ordered to pay $528,000 in restitution for conspiracy, health care fraud, and false statements. The podiatrist, after being reinstated to the Medicare program in 2002, billed Medicare for non-covered routine foot care. Patient charts contained no documentation other than the handwritten date of service. In 2000, the Department of Justice recommended that the podiatrist be excluded for failure to repay his Health Educational Assistance Loan. In order to avoid the exclusion, the podiatrist submitted a fraudulent provider application to Medicare listing the owner of his new company as his dying friend, who was also a podiatrist, and began billing under the false identity.</p>
<p>In Virginia, a podiatrist was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for mail fraud. The podiatrist billed for procedures performed at a surgery center when, in fact, the services performed were routine, and performed in the office.

Through his billing scheme, the podiatrist was reimbursed for facility-related charges such as pre-op and post-op rooms.</p>


<h3>Child Support Enforcement</h3>
<p>In Florida, a man was sentenced to 5 years probation and ordered to pay $47,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support.

The man's last documented support payment was involuntary and occurred in May 1990. The investigation revealed that the man had changed his last name, and lived in at least four different States after leaving Florida.</p>

In addition, costs for nursing services for non-Medicare beneficiaries were shifted to the HHA's Medicare cost reports.</p>

The orthotist was sentenced to 28 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.8 million in restitution; he collaborated with DME owners to provide signed documentation for orthotic devices without ever examining the patient. The DME companies then billed for custom-fitted devices when actually, a prefabricated device was provided. The patient recruiter was sentenced to 22 months in prison and ordered to pay approximately $4.2 million in restitution.
