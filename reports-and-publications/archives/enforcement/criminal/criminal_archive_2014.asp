Beck, Jr.. The indictment charges that Robinson-White committed health care fraud by falsely billing claims to Medicaid for birth control devices known as intrauterine devices ("IUDs"). Robinson-White purchased these IUDs from a company in Great Neck, New York. Because the IUDs were made outside the United States and because the IUDs were not labeling in English, they are considered misbranded drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The IUDs are treated as misbranded drugs under the law because they release the birth control drug, levonorgestrel. Further, because the IUDs were misbranded, Robinson-White obtained them cheaper than a lawful IUD.</dd>
