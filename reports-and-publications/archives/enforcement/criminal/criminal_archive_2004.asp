<span class="criminal">

<h3>Hospitals, Laboratories, and Clinics</h3>
<p>In South Carolina, the remaining five physicians from a pain management center were sentenced for their roles in defrauding the Government. They were the last of ten individuals sentenced in a case that resulted in over 70 years total incarceration and ordered restitution totaling approximately $811,000. The doctors at the center prescribed controlled substances outside the usual course of medical practice and forced unnecessary tests on patients in order to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare and other health care plans. Narcotics were provided to patients after little or no physical exam, and doctors met with more than one patient at a time in an effort to increase the clinic's revenue.</p>


<h3>Durable Medical Equipment</h3>
<p>In South Carolina, an owner/operator of a DME company was sentenced to 5 months in prison and ordered to pay $88,000 in restitution for health care fraud. From February 1998 through 2002, the woman submitted claims for repairs to wheelchairs and mechanical hospital beds that were never performed.</p>


<h3>Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals</h3>
<p>In New York, a man was sentenced to 24 months incarceration and ordered to pay $398,000 in restitution for health care fraud. Although he possessed a valid license as a clinical psychologist in Massachusetts, the man did not meet the criteria for licensure in New York but purported to be licensed in the State. Based on the Massachusetts license, he was able to obtain Medicare and private provider numbers. The man used these numbers to submit claims to Medicare that were upcoded, not rendered, or for telephonic services. For his private pay patients, he submitted claims as if the patients were treated in Massachusetts.</p>


<h3>Medicaid Fraud</h3>
<p>In Virginia, two operators of a cab service were sentenced to 27 months and 21 months in prison, respectively, for submitting claims to Medicaid for taxi services they did not provide. They were also ordered to pay $395,000 in joint and several restitution.</p>

<span class="criminal">

<h3>Hospitals, Laboratories, and Clinics</h3>
<p>In Arizona, two operators of a small community mental health clinic were sentenced for false statements relating to health care matters. They were each ordered to pay $40,000 in restitution. The investigation revealed that they used a matrix of keywords in order to systematically create false progress notes to pass the Medicare carrier's medical review. They also photocopied doctors' signatures on plans-of-care to keep patients in the partial hospitalization program for extended periods of time.</p>


<h3>Transportation Fraud</h3>
<p>In Georgia, two individuals and an ambulance company were sentenced related to charges of providing medically unnecessary ambulance runs and for using non-licensed personnel. One of the individuals was sentenced to 30 months in prison, and the other was sentenced to 21 months in prison. The company was ordered to pay a $650,000 fine.

<h3>Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals</h3>
<p>In Pennsylvania, a chiropractor was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $10,000 in fines and restitution for mail fraud in connection with the death of a Medicaid patient. A world-renowned chiropractor, the woman admitted that she deprived patients of their intangible right to her honest services by acting outside the scope of her field in treating patients with conditions such as epilepsy and Down Syndrome. The chiropractor admitted that the death of a 32-year-old epileptic Medicaid patient in 1999 was the direct result of her actions when she convinced the woman that she could cure her of her epilepsy. She informed her patient that to be seizure free, she must be drug free. As such, she convinced the patient to stop taking her anti-convulsive medications. After discontinuing the medications, the patient began to experience violent grand mal seizures, some of which occurred in the chiropractor's presence, over the next several days. The chiropractor took no steps to seek proper medical treatment for her patient, despite the fact that she could no longer walk, was forced to wear adult diapers, was confined to a wheel chair, was severely dehydrated, had aspirated the contents of her stomach into her lungs and was unconscious. From April 26, 1999 through April 28, 1999, the patient was taken in this condition to see the chiropractor who characterized her condition as normal and that she was merely getting the drugs out of her system. The chiropractor specifically warned the patient's fiancé that if he took her to the hospital, she would be administered the anti-convulsive medications and she could die. The patient was pronounced dead in the early morning of April 29, 1999. The cause of death was complications from uncontrolled epilepsy.</p>


<h3>Child Support Enforcement</h3>
<p>In Virginia, a man was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, 1 year supervised release and ordered to pay $62,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support. In order to avoid paying child support, the man used numerous aliases and social security numbers. When arrested, the man was using an alias but was correctly identified through a match of fingerprints on file with the FBI.</p>

<h3>Durable Medical Equipment</h3>

In addition, claims submitted reflected comprehensive office visits that did not occur at all, or were for dates of service when the patient was only provided a prescription refill. The investigation began in July 2003 when the private insurer found that the physician's billings were much higher than the average medical provider in the area. Shortly after the investigation began, a fire occurred at the physician's medical office, which was determined to be a case of arson.

<h3>Prescription Drug Fraud</h3>
<p>In Rhode Island, a pharmacist was sentenced to 37 months in prison for charges related to selling prescription drug samples to customers at his pharmacy. In addition, the pharmacist was ordered to forfeit $431,000 to the Government and pay a $45,000 fine.

<h3>Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals</h3>
<p>In Ohio, a chiropractor was sentenced to 1-year incarceration and ordered to pay $79,000 in restitution for health care fraud. Regardless of the service he actually performed, the man billed all services as manipulative treatments since it is the only service for which Medicare authorizes reimbursement.

<p>In Maine, a registered nurse was sentenced to 18 months in jail with all but 45 days suspended for theft of drugs. While working at a hospital emergency room, the woman stole morphine on at least three occasions.</p>

<h3>Nursing Homes</h3>
<p>In Louisiana, the former owner of a nursing home management company was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment for health care fraud and pension fraud. In addition, he was ordered to forfeit his $700,000 residence, a retirement estate valued at approximately $2.5 million, and numerous pieces of construction equipment. Through his company, the man, who owned three nursing homes, diverted Medicare and Medicaid money intended for the care of residents for his own personal use. Because these funds were diverted, facilities were inadequately staffed and residents were forced to do without proper personal care items and medications. In addition, the man claimed $2.3 million on cost reports for payments to vendors when, in fact, the funds were diverted for his own personal use; failed to timely deposit pension plan funds withheld from employees' paychecks; and as the administrator of the pension plan, made unauthorized loans to himself to pay debts of his construction company and retirement estate. The man's retirement estate contained five manmade ponds, a stone-lined manmade waterfall, and exotic swans. Though his nursing homes were inadequately staffed, he used nursing home monies to employ five to seven groundskeepers to properly care for his retirement estate. At one of the nursing home facilities, a nurse was forced to cut the knee-high grass.</p>
