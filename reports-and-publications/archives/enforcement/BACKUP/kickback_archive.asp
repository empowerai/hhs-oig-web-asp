<dd>American Medical Imaging, Inc., a diagnostic imaging company, and its owners, all of Tennessee, agreed to pay $225,000 to resolve their liability under the CMP provisions applicable to kickbacks, physician self-referrals, and false or fraudulent claims. In addition, one of the owners of the company agreed to a permanent exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs and the other owner agreed to certain integrity provisions. The company paid physicians ostensibly to rent space in the physicians' offices. The OIG alleged that the payments violated both the kickback and physician self-referral statutes because the payments exceeded fair market value and varied based on the number of services referred by the physicians to the company. In addition, the OIG alleged that the company submitted claims with inappropriate diagnosis codes chosen based on reimbursement rather than medical justification.</dd>
