<dd>Brackenridge Hospital (Brackenridge), Texas, agreed to pay $25,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide stabilizing treatment to an adult male who presented to its emergency department (ED) with complaints of having a severe headache for four days.  A CT scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Brackenridge's ED physician determined that the patient needed to be seen by a neurosurgeon.  The ED physician called its on-call neurosurgeon.  The on-call neurosurgeon refused to go to the ED to examine or treat the patient, stating that she would only see pediatric patients.  The patient was transferred to a hospital nearly 66 miles away and was hospitalized for three days.</dd>



<dt>07-30-2007</dt>
<dd>Regional Medical Center of San Jose (RMC), California, agreed to pay $20,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of its staff and facilities and improperly transferred a critically injured two-year-old child that presented to its emergency department (ED) after being struck by a car.  </dd>

<dd>Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare - St. Joseph, Inc. f/k/a St. Joseph Regional Medical Center (St. Joseph), Wisconsin, agreed to pay $40,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to a woman that presented to St. Joseph's emergency department (ED) complaining of severe upper quadrant abdominal, hip, and thigh pain, following a motor vehicle accident.  The ED physician diagnosed the patient as having a right hip and thigh contusion and did not conduct any lab work, x-rays, or a CT scan.  The patient was given an anti-inflammatory and discharged.  The patient protested leaving the ED, informed a nurse that she was in extreme pain and could not walk.  Hospital staff told the patient to leave the hospital and threatened to call the police.  The patient was then placed in a wheelchair and escorted to her relative's car by hospital security.  The patient presented to another hospital's ED where an x-ray revealed that she had a dislocated right hip and a CT scan of the hip revealed an acetabular fracture that prevented relocation of the hip without surgery.</dd>




<dt>06-27-2007</dt>
<dd>Homestead Hospital, Inc. (HHI), Florida, agreed to pay $15,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to a patient who was 41 weeks pregnant with regular contractions.

<dt>06-06-2007</dt>
<dd>Intermountain Healthcare d/b/a American Fork Hospital (AFH), a small hospital in Utah, agreed to pay $25,000 to resolve two allegations of patient dumping. In the first incident, the OIG alleged that AFH failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to a 15-year-old girl that presented to AFH's emergency department (ED) complaining of severe abdominal pain and nausea. She was seen in the ED the day before and returned in a worsened condition. Before evaluating the condition of the patient, the hospital told the patient's father that his co-pay would be 70% versus the 10% he was charged the previous day. The father took his daughter to another hospital where she was given morphine and phenegran and underwent surgery the next day.</dd>

<dd>In the second incident, a 73-year-old resident at an assisted living center presented to AFH's ED by ambulance with complaints of difficulty breathing. The OIG alleged that AFH failed to provide the patient with an appropriate medical screening examination or stabilizing treatment before transferring her to another hospital. The patient had high blood pressure, a fast pulse rate, and a history of stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure. While the patient expressed an interest in being treated by her doctors at another hospital, the risks of her being transferred in very serious condition were not discussed with her or her family member. Upon arrival to the next hospital, she was admitted and remained in the hospital's ICU for 9 days.</dd>


<dt>05-30-2007</dt>
<dd>Medical Center of Arlington (MCA), Texas, agreed to pay $30,000 to resolve allegations that it violated the screening, stabilization, and transfer provisions of the patient dumping statute when a female in her 39th week of pregnancy presented to MCA's labor and delivery department with contractions.

<dt>05-22-2007</dt>
<dd>Western Plains Medical Complex (Western), a small hospital in Kansas, agreed to pay $25,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination, stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer to a 16-year-old female who presented to its emergency department seeking treatment for seizures.

<dd>St. Mary's Medical Center (St. Mary's), Indiana, agreed to pay $40,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide stabilizing treatment to an uninsured male that presented to St. Mary's emergency department (ED) in an unresponsive state.  A CT scan revealed a subarachnoid intraventricular hemorrhage, an extremely acute neurological condition.  St. Mary's ED physician determined that the patient needed to be seen by a neurosurgeon.  The ED physician called its on-call neurosurgeon.  The on-call neurosurgeon was in the hospital, but he refused to go to the ED to examine or treat the patient.  Instead, he directed the ED physician to transfer the patient to another hospital that was located approximately 183 miles away.  Before transfer, the neurosurgeon at the receiving hospital informed St. Mary's that the patient needed a ventricular shunt as soon as possible to divert the flow of excess fluid and relieve the pressure on the brain.  St. Mary's did not have their neurosurgeon install the shunt; instead they transferred the patient to the other hospital without providing any further screening or treatment.  Upon the patient's arrival at the other hospital, he was brain dead.</dd>
