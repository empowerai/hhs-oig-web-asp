GATES - Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman today announced the guilty plea and sentencing of Medicaid recipient David Epps to six months in jail for engaging in a kickback scheme with his personal care aide.  The facts are substantially as follows: over the course of approximately six weeks last summer, Epps' personal care aide submitted time sheets to her employer and ultimately Medicaid, indicating that she had provided personal care services to him, when in fact she had not since Epps was incarcerated during that time.  Epps had an agreement with his aide that she would falsify the time sheets indicating that she had provided him services when in fact she had not.  Once the aide was paid by her employer, she kicked back approximately $100 per pay check for the phony services.  The theft resulted in over $5,000 worth of false billings to Medicaid. </dd>

NEW YORK - Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman today announced that his office has resolved the antitrust lawsuit it brought in September 2014, which has successfully prevented pharmaceutical manufacturer Allergan plc (previously named Actavis plc) from forcing Alzheimer's patients to switch medications as part of an anticompetitive strategy designed to maintain high drug prices.  In December 2014, a federal judge granted New York's request for an injunction and prohibited Allergan from engaging in the controversial tactic - sometimes called a "forced switch" - which would have needlessly disrupted the treatment plans of these patients solely to protect corporate profits.  Because the injunction protected competition and allowed low cost generic drugs to enter the market unimpeded, the Attorney General's office has determined that it is no longer necessary to continue legal action.</dd>

On Thursday, June 12, 2014, Garry A. Hankerson, Jr. pleaded guilty to Racketeering, Medicaid Fraud, and Conspiracy to Defraud the State in Cobb County Superior Court. Hankerson and his co-defendants obtained over $622,000 through the fraudulent billing of Georgia Medicaid and the Amerigroup Corporation. Hankerson is the co-owner of First Step Counseling Services, Inc. of Marietta, which provided Intensive Family Intervention counseling services as well as Family and Individual counseling services to troubled children in need of intensive therapy for behavioral issues. Children who qualify for these services under Medicaid typically do so because they are in danger of being removed from their homes. Between July 2005 and June 2010, Hankerson and his accomplices would use their patient's Medicaid numbers to bill far in excess of the services provided, sometimes billing when children were no longer in the State of Georgia. Some patients reported being seen only twice, while First Step billed for hundreds of counseling sessions. In sum, over 3,000 false claims were identified over a five year period.</dd>
