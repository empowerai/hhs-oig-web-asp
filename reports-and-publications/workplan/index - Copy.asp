<p>The Office of Inspector General's ( <acronym title="Office of Inspector General">OlG</acronym> ) Work Plan sets forth various projects to be addressed during the fiscal year by the Office of Audit Services, Office of Evaluation and Inspections, Office of Investigations, and Office of Counsel to the Inspector General. The Work Plan includes projects planned in each of the Department's major entities: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; the public health agencies; the Administrations for Children & Families; and Administration on Aging. Information is also provided on projects related to issues that cut across departmental programs, including State and local government use of Federal funds, as well as the functional areas of the Office of the Secretary of Health & Human Services (HHS). Some of the projects described in the Work Plan are statutorily required, such as the audit of the Department's financial statements, which is mandated by the Government Management Reform Act. </p>

<p><acronym title="Office of Inspector General">OIG</acronym> does not provide additional details on jobs to be undertaken or information on the status of jobs contained in its Work Plan. For example, although estimated issue dates are provided in the Work Plan, we would not provide revised estimates or current status. </p>

Work planning is an ongoing and evolving process, and the Work Plan is updated throughout the year.  OIG publically releases its Work Plan twice each year.  This edition of the Work Plan describes OIG audits and evaluations that are underway or planned, and certain legal and investigative initiatives that are continuing.  It also notes items that have been completed, postponed, or canceled and includes new items that have been started or planned since October 2015. </p>
