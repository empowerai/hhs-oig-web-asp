<h2>Fostering Economical Payment Policies</h2>


<p>As a result of certain payment policies, Medicare pays significantly different amounts for the same services for similar patients in different settings.  For example, Medicare pays significantly more for services performed in an outpatient hospital department than for the same services performed in an ambulatory surgical center (ASC).  For low-risk patients who do not need hospital-level care at an outpatient hospital department, Medicare could save billions of dollars by paying for those services at ASC rates.  In another example, Medicare could reduce expenditures by millions of dollars per year if infusion drugs administered in conjunction with DME were paid on the basis of average sales prices, as is the case with most other drugs covered by  Medicare Part B.</p>

<p>Certain payment policies that create incentives for providers to bill for more expensive care instead of the appropriate levels of care result in billions of dollars in wasteful spending and compromised care for beneficiaries.  For example, Medicare's payment policy for skilled nursing facility (SNF) beneficiaries who also need therapy give providers incentive to bill for higher levels of therapy than necessary.  </p>
