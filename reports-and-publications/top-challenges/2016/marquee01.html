<h2>Reducing Improper Payments</h2>

  
<p>CMS reported an improper payment rate of 12.7 percent for Medicare fee for service (Parts A and B), corresponding to an estimated $45.8 billion in improper payments in FY 2014. This measure includes payments for unnecessary services, billing or coding errors, and payments for claims that did not meet documentation or other Medicare coverage requirements. (For more information on improper payment rate measurement and reporting, see Management Challenge 4.)</p> 

<p>Challenges affect every stage of the payment process, from making the initial payment accurately (including implementing appropriate payment edits) to recovering overpayments. High Medicare improper payment rates exist for various services, including home health, skilled nursing, and evaluation and management services. Audits of hospitals have uncovered and sought to remedy improper billing and payments for myriad issues, such as incorrect billing for transfers to post-acute care and inaccurate patient diagnosis codes. Furthermore, accurate billing by hospitals for short inpatient stays versus outpatient observation stays has been an area of considerable challenge and concern. CMS relies on contractors for most of these crucial functions; however, OIG has identified deficiencies in contractor performance and in CMS's oversight of these contractors. Medicare's recent transition to a new system of diagnosis codes, the ICD-10, may bring implementation challenges and potential increases in improper billing as providers and suppliers transition to the new codes. In the lead-up to implementation of ICD-10, CMS has issued guidance providing temporary flexibility in the claims auditing and quality reporting process in response to requests from the provider community.</p>

<p>The Department is facing significant challenges in adjudicating provider appeals of Medicare overpayments - which primarily include Parts A and B claims - including a substantial backlog of appeals at the administrative law judge (ALJ) level (third level of appeals, administered by the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals); inconsistent decisions among the ALJs and between the ALJs and Qualified Independent Contractors (second level of appeals, administered by CMS); and insufficient CMS participation in the appellate process. </p>
