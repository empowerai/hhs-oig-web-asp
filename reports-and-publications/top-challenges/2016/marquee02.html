<h2>Preventing and Deterring Fraud</h2>

<p>Curbing fraud is vital to conserving scarce health care resources and protecting beneficiaries.  Fraud schemes shift over time, but certain Medicare services have been consistent targets.  They include services provided by durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, home health and hospice agencies, community mental health centers, clinical laboratories, ambulance transportation suppliers, outpatient therapy providers, and chiropractors.  CMS's contractors play a key role in fighting Medicare fraud.  However, CMS is not realizing the full potential of contractors to proactively identify fraud and address other program integrity concerns.   </p>
