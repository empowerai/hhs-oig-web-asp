<h2>CMS should seek a legislative change to directly require all manufacturers of Medicare Part B drugs to submit ASPs.</h2>



<p>Manufacturer-reported average sales prices (ASPs) serve as the basis for the reimbursement amounts for most drugs covered under Medicare Part B. Complete ASP data ensure that reimbursement amounts are accurate and reflect all manufacturer sales prices. However, in certain cases, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servies (CMS) lacks complete ASP data because not all manufacturers of Medicare Part B drugs are required to report ASPs.  We recommend that CMS seek a legislative change to directly require all manufacturers of Medicare Part B drugs to submit ASPs. <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-13-00040.asp">Limitations in Manufacturer Reporting of Average Sales Price Data for Part B Drugs (OEI-12-13-00040)</a></p>
