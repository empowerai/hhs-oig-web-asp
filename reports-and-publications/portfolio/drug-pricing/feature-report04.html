<p>
Prices for the most commonly used brand-name drugs have risen substantially since 2002. For example, prices for the most commonly used brand-name drugs increased nearly 13 percent in 2013; this increase was 8 times greater than the general inflation rate for the same year. OIG is currently examining <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/archives/workplan/2017/HHS%20OIG%20Work%20Plan%202017_508.pdf#page=45">Increases in Prices for Brand-Name Drugs Under Medicare Part D (OEI-03-15-00080)</a>. We will evaluate the extent to which pharmacy reimbursement for brand-name drugs under Medicare Part D changed between 2011 and 2015 and compare the rate of change in pharmacy reimbursement for brand-name drugs under Medicare Part D to the rate of inflation for the same period.
