<h2>CMS should consider pursuing rulemaking to expand the price substitution policy in Medicare Part B.</h2>


 <p>When Congress established ASP as the basis for Medicare Part B drug reimbursement, it required OIG to monitor the relationship between ASPs and AMPs. If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent, CMS substitutes the ASP-based reimbursement amount with the lesser of the widely available market price or 103 percent of AMP.  CMS may make this price substitution when OIG identifies a drug that exceeds the 5 percent threshold in the two previous quarters or three of the four previous quarters.  OIG recommends that CMS should consider broadening its price-substitution criteria.  For example, a more expansive policy might include drugs that exceed the 5-percent threshold in a single quarter.  Such a revised policy could still provide CMS the discretion to forgo a price substitution when warranted. <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-14-00520.asp">Average Sales Prices and Average Manufacturer Prices for Medicare Part B Drugs: An Overview of 2013 (OEI-03-14-00520)</a></p>
