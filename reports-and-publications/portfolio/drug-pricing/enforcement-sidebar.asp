<h3>Background</h3>
<p style="font-size:9pt; color: #333; line-height:1.4">OIG issued two reports in 2010  that addressed the failure of drug manufacturers to timely report average manufacturer price (AMP) and average sales price (ASP) data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  In these reports, OIG recommended that CMS refer manufacturers that fail to report timely pricing information to OIG for potential enforcement action.  </p>

<p style="font-size:9pt; color: #333; line-height:1.4">In September 2010, OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin  to notify drug manufacturers that OIG intended to pursue enforcement actions, utilizing its <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/cmp/background.asp">civil monetary penalty</a> (CMP)  authority, against drug manufacturers that failed to submit timely AMP and ASP information.  Since September 2010, OIG has settled 11 CMP cases against drug manufacturers relating to drug price reporting issues, totaling approximately $18 million. </p>
