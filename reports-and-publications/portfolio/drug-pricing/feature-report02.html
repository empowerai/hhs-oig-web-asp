<p>
In this ongoing <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/map/">series of reports</a>, OIG is determining whether each State recouped from drug manufacturers the rebates owed to States and the Federal Government for covered outpatient drugs dispensed in the Medicaid program.  Most of the reports in this series focus on traditional Medicaid (fee-for-service), looking at rebates for drugs administered by physicians in offices or hospital outpatient facilities. Other reports focus on Medicaid managed care, with some solely examining drugs   administered by physicians and some looking at rebates for  covered outpatient drugs. OIG's work on this topic began in 2013 and will continue through 2017.
