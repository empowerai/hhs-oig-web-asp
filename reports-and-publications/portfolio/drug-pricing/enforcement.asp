				<h1 id="port">OIG Online Portfolio: Drug Pricing and Reimbursement</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">This online portfolio pulls together the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) body of work since 2010 plus several older relevant items that relate to drug pricing and reimbursement in HHS programs. The portfolio features planned work, completed reports, industry guidance, and enforcement actions. This portfolio does not cover OIG's body of work focused on questionable or fraudulent billing for prescription drugs. This portfolio on drug pricing and reimbursement will be updated periodically.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<div id="tab-interior">

<p>OIG has the authority to seek <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/cmp/index.asp">civil monetary penalties</a> (CMP), assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity on the basis of a wide variety of prohibited conduct, including that related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. This program requires drug manufacturers to submit pricing information to HHS and to pay a rebate to State Medicaid programs for each unit of the covered drug that State Medicaid programs reimburse. Manufacturers with Medicaid drug rebate agreements are also required to report price information that is used to set average sales price (ASP), the reimbursement metric for most drugs covered by Medicare Part B. </p>

<p>Given the importance of timely and accurate submission of pricing information, OIG may seek a CMP against a drug manufacturer that fails to report in a timely manner the required information or that knowingly submits false information.  In September 2010, OIG issued a <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/docs/alertsandbulletins/2010/SpAdvBulletin_AMP_ASP.pdf">Special Advisory Bulletin, "Average Manufacturer Price and Average Sales Price Reporting Requirements,"</a>  that notified drug manufacturers that OIG intended to pursue enforcement actions against manufacturers that failed to submit timely and accurate data necessary for the effective operation of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B program, the Federal Upper Limit Program, and the Medicare Part B outpatient prescription drug benefit.  See below for recent cases.</p>
