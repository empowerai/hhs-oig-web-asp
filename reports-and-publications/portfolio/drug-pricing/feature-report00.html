<h2>Proposed Work on Data Integrity</h2>

<img src="./images/pie.jpg" alt="a pie chart" style="float:left; margin-right:10px" />


<p>OIG is conducting several new reviews to build upon its prior work involving data integrity related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, two of which are part of the drug pricing and payment portfolio: In Accuracy of Drug Classification Data Used to Collect Medicaid Rebates (OEI-03-17-00100), OIG will examine the accuracy of CMS' Medicaid drug rebate classification data and will review the tools and processes CMS has in place to ensure that manufacturers are in compliance with Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements, and In Reasonable Assumptions in Manufacturer AMP Reporting (OEI-12-17-00130), OIG will review drug manufacturers' reasonable assumptions when calculating drug prices used for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and will interview CMS staff regarding the agency's oversight of reasonable assumption submissions.</p>
