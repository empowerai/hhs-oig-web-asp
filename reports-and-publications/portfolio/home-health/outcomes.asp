<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<div id="tab-interior">

<p>OIG makes recommendations to HHS that would have a positive effect on HHS programs in terms of cost savings and/or quality improvements. These recommendations come from OIG's audits and evaluations. Significant recommendations that remain unimplemented are incorporated into OIG's annual <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/compendium/">Compendium of Unimplemented Recommendations</a>. Below is a list of those that are home health-related:</p>

<h3>Home Health: Challenges and Accomplishments</h3>
<p>OIG's recommendations come from its audits and evaluations, and often relate to significant <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/top-challenges/2015/">management and performance challenges</a> facing HHS. Every year, OIG compiles a list of Top Management and Performance Challenges facing HHS and publishes them on our website and in the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/afr/fy-2015-hhs-agency-financial-report.pdf">Agency Financial Report</a>. The home health industry is referenced either directly or indirectly in several of these challenges. The list was last updated in November 2015.  </p>

<p>OIG's latest activities, including work affecting the home health industry, can also be found in its <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/semiannual/index.asp">Semiannual Report to Congress</a>, which is published twice a year.  Visit the other sections of this web portfolio to learn more about the work OIG is doing in the home health industry. </p>

<h4><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/top-challenges/2015/challenge06.asp">Ensuring Quality in Nursing Home, Hospice, and Home- and Community-Based Care</a></h4>
<p>As Americans continue to live longer and with more chronic medical conditions, the Department must ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality nursing home, hospice, and home- and community-based services (HCBS), including personal care services (PCS). Challenges persist with fraud, waste, and abuse with nursing home and hospice care and HCBS. The Department continues efforts to improve the quality of these services through implementation of new systems such as the Five Star Quality Rating System. OIG believes more should be done to prioritize quality care for this community to improve internal controls and offer better guidance and training for surveyors to ensure that nursing homes with recorded quality and safety issues correct their deficiencies. </p> 


<h4><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/top-challenges/2015/challenge02.asp">Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in Medicare Parts A and B</a></h4>
<p>In FY 2014, CMS made an estimated $45.8 billion in improper payments for Medicare fee for service (FFS) in Parts A and B. The deleterious effects of the 12.7 percent improper payment rate include payments for unnecessary services, billing and coding errors, and payments for claims that did not meet documentation or coverage requirements. The Department has taken steps to implement OIG's recommendations to reduce Medicare fraud, resulting in an estimated $15 billion in savings in FY 2014. However, challenges continue in preventing and deterring fraud and fostering economical payment policies. Moving forward, CMS needs to identify and recover these improper payments in a timely manner, make constructive changes to the Medicare appeals system by providing sufficient participation and consistent decisions in the appellate process, and ensure effective contractor performance to properly address this TMC. </p>

<p>OIG's <em><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/compendium/index.asp">Semiannual Reports to Congress</a></em> describes significant problems, abuses, deficiencies, and investigative outcomes as well as summarizing key accomplishments. Home health-related issues and accomplishments include:</p>

<div class="indented">
<h4><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/strike-force/">Medicare Fraud Strike Force Action</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>June 2015, a nationwide takedown led by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force resulted in charges against 243 defendants, including doctors, nurses, and other licensed medical professionals. These defendants were charged in various health care fraud-related crimes, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, violations of the anti-kickback statute, money laundering, and aggravated identity theft. The charges were based on a variety of alleged fraud schemes; these involved various medical treatments and services, including home health care, psychotherapy, physical and occupational therapy, durable medical equipment, and pharmacy fraud. The takedown, the largest in Strike Force history, was part of a coordinated operation across 17 districts and potentially involved over $700 million in false billings to Medicare and Medicaid.</li>

<ul>
<li>All home health agencies (HHAs) conducted background checks on prospective employees; however, our review of six employees with convictions for crimes against persons found that three have convictions that appear-based on available data-to disqualify them from employment in HHAs. Our findings raise concerns about whether HHA employees undergo. </li>
