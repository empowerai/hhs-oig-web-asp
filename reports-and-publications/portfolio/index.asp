OIG Online Portfolio: <a href="/reports-and-publications/portfolio/home-health/">Home Health</a></dt>
<dd>The Medicare home health benefit has long been recognized as a program area vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. The benefit was established to provide skilled nursing care, home based assistance, and therapeutic services to qualifying homebound individuals. Home health care represents a significant component of Medicare expenditures. In calendar year 2015, Medicare reimbursed over 11,000 distinct home health agencies (HHAs) for almost 7 million episodes of home health care, totaling approximately $18.7 billion.</dd>

An OIG Portfolio: <a href="/oei/reports/oei-03-15-00180.asp">Ensuring the Integrity of Medicare Part D</a>, (OEI-03-15-00180)</dt>
<dd>This portfolio presents an overview of Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigations, audits, evaluations, and legal guidance related to Part D. It synthesizes numerous OIG reports that have identified weaknesses in Part D program integrity, and provides updates on Departmental efforts to address these weaknesses. In particular, OIG has identified weaknesses in the use of data to identify vulnerabilities, as well as in the oversight by all parties responsible for protecting Part D: Part D plan sponsors, the Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). OIG has made recommendations to strengthen Part D program integrity, and progress has been made. However, Part D remains vulnerable to fraud, as evidenced by ongoing investigations. To fully protect Part D from fraud, waste, and abuse, CMS should take further action and implement OIG's unimplemented recommendations.</dd>

Our latest product, an OIG Portfolio entitled Personal Care Services: Trends, Vulnerabilities, and Recommendations for Improvement, synthesizes this body of work and offers new and comprehensive recommendations to address vulnerabilities. </p></dd>
