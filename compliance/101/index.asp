<p>Welcome to OIG's Compliance 101 Web page.  OIG developed the free educational resources listed on this Web page to help health care providers, practitioners, and suppliers understand the health care fraud and abuse laws and the consequences of violating them.  These compliance education materials can also provide ideas for ways to cultivate a culture of compliance within your own health care organization. </p>

<h2>General Compliance Education Materials</h2>

<h3>Compliance Program Guidance</h3>
<p>OIG has developed a series of voluntary compliance program guidance documents directed at various segments of the health care industry, such as hospitals, nursing homes, third-party billers, and durable medical equipment suppliers, to encourage the development and use of internal controls to monitor adherence to statutes, regulations, and program requirements. The documents provide principles to follow when developing a compliance program that best suits your organization's needs. The documents also identify fraud and abuse risks to watch out for when creating a program.</p>
