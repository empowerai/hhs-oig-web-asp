<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has several self-disclosure processes that can be used to report potential fraud in Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs. Choose the one that applies&nbsp;to you from the following descriptions to learn more. </p>

<p><strong style="color:#B10000">Self-disclosures should not be reported to the OIG Hotline.</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/compliance/self-disclosure-info/protocol.asp">Health Care Provider Self-Disclosures</a></st>
<dd>Health care providers, suppliers, or other individuals or entities subject to <a href="/fraud/enforcement/cmp/index.asp">Civil Monetary Penalties</a> can use the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol, which was created in 1998, to voluntarily disclose self-discovered evidence of potential fraud. Self-disclosure gives providers the opportunity to avoid the costs and disruptions associated with a Government-directed investigation and civil or administrative litigation. Visit the <a href="/compliance/self-disclosure-info/protocol.asp">Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol</a> webpage for more information.</dd>

<dt><a href="/compliance/self-disclosure-info/contractor.asp">HHS Contractor Self-Disclosures</a></dt>
<dd>Contractors are individuals, businesses, or other legal entities that are awarded Government contracts, or subcontracts, to provide services to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). OIG's contractor self-disclosure program enables contractors to self-disclose potential violations of the False Claims Act and various Federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or gratuity.  This self-disclosure process is available for those entities with a Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contract. Visit the <a href="/compliance/self-disclosure-info/contractor.asp">Contractor Self-Disclosure</a> webpage for more information.</dd>

<dt>HHS Grantee Self-Disclosures</dt>
<dd>HHS grantees or subrecipients may voluntarily disclose evidence of potential violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations, potentially affecting the Federal award.  
45 C.F.R. 75.113 notes mandatory disclosures of criminal offenses that non-Federal entities must make with respect to HHS grants.  
Recipients submitting disclosures in connection with this requirement should include the subject reference line "Mandatory Grant Disclosure."
Recipients choosing to disclose conduct that may not fit squarely within the scope of offenses described in 45 C.F.R. 75.113, should include the following subject reference line in the submission: "Voluntary Grant Disclosure."</dd>  

Both mandatory and voluntary self-disclosures should be mailed to: <br />
