<p><img class="r" src="./images/phys_training_promo.png" alt="Booklet Cover" />The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services has created the educational materials listed below to assist in teaching physicians about the Federal
laws designed to protect the Medicare and Medicaid programs and program beneficiaries from fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>

<ul class="simplegray stay_blue">
<li><a target="_blank" href="/compliance/physician-education/roadmap_web_version.pdf"><em>A Roadmap for New Physicians: Avoiding Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse</em></a>&nbsp;<acronym title="Portable Document Format" class="file_type">(<a href="#pdf">PDF</a>)</acronym>,
which is a booklet for physicians' self-study.</li>
 
<li><a target="_blank" href="/compliance/physician-education/roadmap_powerpoint.ppt">A companion PowerPoint presentation</a>&nbsp;<acronym title="Microsoft PowerPoint" class="file_type">(PPT)</acronym> that we encourage you to use to teach the material contained in the Roadmap.</li>
 
<li><a target="_blank" href="/compliance/physician-education/roadmap_speaker_notes.pdf">The speaker note set</a>&nbsp;<acronym title="Portable Document Format" class="file_type">(<a href="#pdf">PDF</a>)</acronym>, which will assist you in giving the PowerPoint presentation.</li>
 
<li>For physicians who may be unable to attend a live, didactic presentation of the material
contained in the Roadmap, we also have provided <a class="acc_trigger" href="#video">a narration of the speaker notes</a> to accompany the PowerPoint slides. 
<div class="acc_container">

					<p>The following presentation summarizes the five main Federal fraud and abuse laws (the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the Exclusion Statute, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law) and provide tips on how physicians should comply with these laws in their relationships with payers (e.g., the Medicare and Medicaid programs), vendors (e.g., drug, biologic, and medical device companies), and fellow providers (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, and physician colleagues).</p>
