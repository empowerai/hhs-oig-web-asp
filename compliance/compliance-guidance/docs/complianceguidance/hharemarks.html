<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Welcome and 
  thank you for joining us today. We have invited you here for three reasons: 
  </strong></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>-- First and foremost, 
    to unveil and explain the comprehensive compliance program guidance we have 
    developed for the home health industry; </strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>-- Second, to announce 
    that the general public will be given the opportunity to take part in the 
    development of future compliance program guidance; and </strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>-- Third, to release 
    an updated version of the clinical laboratory guidance that was revised to 
    reflect recent policy changes. </strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>After briefing you on these 
  three actions, we will be pleased to field questions you may have.Simply put, 
  the Compliance Program Guidance for Home Health Agencies describes the fundamentals 
  of an effective program of provider compliance with the rules governing participation 
  in the government's health care programs. It is voluntary guidance designed 
  to help companies prevent fraud, waste and abuse by promoting a high level of 
  ethical and lawful corporate conduct. It was developed in cooperation with the 
  Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Justice, and representatives 
  of the home health industry. I want to personally thank all of them for their 
  valuable contributions to this effort. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Like the guidance issued 
  earlier for clinical laboratories and hospitals, the guidance for home health 
  agencies includes principles that apply to all sectors of the health care provider 
  community as well as ones that are industry specific. The guidance includes 
  seven fundamental elements to an effective compliance program: </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>1. Implementing written 
  policies, procedures, and standards of conduct; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>2. Designating a compliance 
  officer and compliance committee; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>3. Conducting effective 
  training and education; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>4. Developing effective 
  lines of communication;5. Enforcing standards through well-publicized disciplinary 
  guidelines; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>6. Conducting internal 
  monitoring and auditing; and </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>7. Responding promptly 
  to detected offenses and developing corrective action initiatives. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Besides these fundamental 
  principles, there are numerous industry-specific measures. They address risk 
  areas of concern both to the government and the industry. For example, several 
  measures are recommended to help agencies ensure that services are provided 
  only to Medicare beneficiaries who are homebound, require medically necessary 
  services and are under physician-certified plans of care. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Others provisions caution 
  agencies against: </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>* Billing for services 
  not provided; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>* Falsifying records; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>* Paying kickbacks for 
  patient referrals; </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>* Hiring individuals with 
  criminal records; and </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>* Failing to refund overpayments. 
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Additionally, the guidance 
  points out that although it is a physician that determines medical necessity, 
  a home health agency has an obligation to make certain that services it provides 
  are medically necessary and meet other coverage criteria. An agency shares a 
  responsibility for ensuring that the services it delivers and bills for are 
  appropriate. It cannot avoid liability for improper claims simply because a 
  physician has ordered the services. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>In issuing this guidance, 
  we recognize the size-differential that exists between operations of the different 
  home health agencies and organizations that compose the home health industry. 
  Appropriately, this guidance is pertinent for all home health agencies, whether 
  for-profit or non-profit, large or small, urban or rural. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The applicability of the 
  recommendations and guidelines provided in this document depends on the circumstances 
  of each particular home health agency. Given the diversity within the industry, 
  there is no single &quot;best&quot; home health agency compliance program. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Regardless of a home health 
  agency's size and structure, we believe that every home health agency can and 
  should strive to accomplish the objectives and principles underlying all of 
  the compliance policies and procedures recommended within this guidance. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>While this document presents 
  basic procedural and structural guidance for designing a compliance program, 
  it is not in itself a compliance program. Rather, it is a set of guidelines 
  to be considered by a home health agency interested in implementing a compliance 
  program. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>We believe compliance programs 
  are significant because when Medicare or Medicaid fraud is discovered, both 
  the Department of Justice and my office seek to determine whether reasonable 
  precautions were taken by the provider to avoid and detect internal wrongdoing. 
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The release today of this 
  Compliance Guidance for Home Health Agencies is the third time that the OIG 
  has provided guidance on the elements of an effective compliance program. We 
  first offered compliance program guidance for clinical laboratories, and then 
  to hospitals. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Each of these three programs 
  of guidance was developed in collaboration with a limited number of representatives 
  of the provider group for whom the guidance was intended. That process worked 
  reasonably well and resulted in the production of three documents of guidance 
  that have been favorably received by the health care industry. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>However, to better ensure 
  that all viewpoints are taken into account, we are opening up the process to 
  the general public. In the future, a notice will be published in the Federal 
  Register announcing our intentions to develop compliance program guidance for 
  a specific provider group. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>Interested parties will 
  be asked to submit suggestions or to comment on the proposal, after which we 
  will develop a draft of the proposed compliance program guidance. The draft 
  will then be printed in the Federal Register for public comment before the guidance 
  is finalized. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The process will be initiated 
  within the next few days with the publication of a notice in the Federal Register 
  soliciting public comment, input and recommendations for our development of 
  guidance for the durable medical equipment industry. The public will be allowed 
  45 days from the date of publication to respond to the solicitation. Final guidance 
  for the DME industry is expected to be issued before next spring. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>In the meantime, work is 
  continuing on the development of guidance for third-party billing companies. 
  It is tentatively scheduled for release this fall. Because this project is in 
  progress, it will not be subject to the new public-comment process. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>In conclusion, let me note 
  that your press packets include a copy of the revised clinical laboratory guidance. 
  Various clarifications, changes and additions have been made to the guidance 
  since the original was issued in February 1997. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The most significant change 
  relates to the coding for certain tests. Our original lab guidance referenced 
  codes to be used in billing for certain automated multi-channel chemistry tests. 
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The codes were later deleted 
  by the AMA from the 1998 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) book. Consequently, 
  HCFA no longer recognizes these as billable or reimbursable codes. This policy 
  change is reflected in the updated guidance. </strong></font></p>
