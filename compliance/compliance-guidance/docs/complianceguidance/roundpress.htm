<p align="center"><strong>SUMMARY REPORT RELEASED ON FIRST <br>
  OIG-HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE ROUNDTABLE</strong> </p>
<p>April 13, 1999--Washington, DC--For the first time, the Office of Inspector 
  General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services and the health 
  care industry through the industry-leading Health Care Compliance Association 
  (HCCA) conducted a joint roundtable on health care compliance to gain new insights 
  into the challenges of creating effective compliance programs. A summary report 
  on this recent meeting became available today on the OIG's web site <u>(www.hhs.gov/progorg/</u> 
  <u>oig/new.html</u>) and the HCCA's web site (<u>www.hcca-info.org</u>). <br>
  <br wp="br1">
  The March 22 Washington, DC event was a direct result of the OIG wanting to 
  engage in constructive discussions with the health care compliance industry 
  about various practices and policies related to compliance programs, including 
  how to deal with compliance recommendations advanced by the OIG. </p>
<p>&quot;We believe that these roundtable discussions have given us all a greater 
  understanding of how the government and the provider community can work together 
  to protect the integrity of the health care system,&quot; commented Inspector 
  General June Gibbs Brown, who opened the one-day event. </p>
<p>Health Care Compliance Association President Brent Saunders, Esq., added, &quot;We're 
  excited that OIG chose to co-sponsor this program with HCCA, which furthers 
  the commitment of HCCA to promote effective compliance programs throughout the 
  industry.&quot; </p>
<p>Over 125 compliance officers, health care compliance consultants and government 
  representatives attended the event, which was devoted to discussion of those 
  issues of highest relevance to compliance professionals in meeting their professional 
  objectives. Discussion groups focused on compliance professionals' and OIG's 
  experience in four major areas: 
<ul>
  <li>Developing a compliance program;</li>
  <li>Evaluating compliance effectiveness;</li>
  <li>Conducting internal investigations and self-disclosures; and</li>
  <li>Implementing a corporate integrity agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights of some of the most pressing areas in the compliance profession 
  today are as follows: </p>
<p><br wp="br1">
  <u>Developing a compliance program</u>: <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Discussions in this area focused on such subjects as the scope of a compliance 
  program, how to set priorities with a compliance program, and coordination of 
  compliance efforts among different departments within an organization. For instance, 
  to identify and respond to compliance risk areas, providers indicated they mostly 
  focus on what the government highlights, as identified through OIG compliance 
  program guidances, special fraud alerts, OIG work plans and fraud settlements.

  <br wp="br2">
  <u>Evaluating Compliance Program Effectiveness</u>: <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The topics addressed in this area of discussion included monitoring the functions 
  of compliance programs and verifying their effectiveness. For example, government 
  participants cited a number of factors to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness 
  of a provider's compliance efforts, including: 
<ul>
  <li>Management's commitment to compliance, as measured by funding and legitimate 
    support provided to the function;</li>
  <li>Evidence of open lines of communication and the appropriate use of information 
    lines to address employee concerns and questions; and</li>
  <li>A documented practice of refunding of overpayments and self-disclosing incidents 
    of non-compliance with program requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Internal Investigations and Self-Disclosures</u>: </p>
<p>Among the issues discussed in this topic area were determining the parameters 
  and priorities of an internal investigation, the role of attorneys in internal 
  investigations and the procedures for self-disclosure under the OIG's Provider 
  Self-Disclosure Protocol. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  To prioritize these investigations, participants recommended that compliance 
  officers should consider such things as: 
<ul>
  <li>Does a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG require that the compliance 
    officer focus on certain issues?</li>
  <li>Could the issue under investigation have a significant impact on the provider's 
    Medicare cost report and interim payments?</li>
  <li>Does an issue present credible evidence of ongoing misconduct that may violate 
    criminal, civil or administrative law and should be immediately reported to 
    a government authority?</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Corporate Integrity Agreements</u>: </p>
<p>Discussion on corporate integrity agreements (CIA) included how the OIG incorporated 
  the elements of a CIA into an existing compliance program, oversight of providers 
  subject to a CIA, and the mechanics of operating under a CIA. </p>
<p>The Health Care Compliance Association is the only national non-profit organization 
  solely dedicated to improving the quality of health care compliance. Its mission 
  is to provide a collaborative forum promoting integrity and ethical behavior 
  through the development of comprehensive compliance programs throughout the 
  entire health care industry. </p>
<p>The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to protect the integrity 
  of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) programs as well as the 
  health and welfare of beneficiaries served by those programs. This statutory 
  mission is carried out through a nationwide network of audits, investigations, 
  and inspections conducted by three OIG operating components: the Office of Audit 
  Services, the Office of Investigations, and the Office of Evaluation and Inspections. 
  The OIG also informs the Secretary of HHS of programs and management problems 
  and recommends courses to correct them. </p>
