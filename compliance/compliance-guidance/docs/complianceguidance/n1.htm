<p align="center"><big><strong>Inspector General Issues Draft Compliance Program Guidance
for Nursing Facilities</strong></big></p>

<p align="left">The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General
today issued draft guidance to help nursing facilities design effective voluntary
compliance programs to prevent fraud, waste and abuse in health care programs, including
Medicare and Medicaid. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&quot;While enforcement is an essential element of the government's anti-fraud and abuse
campaign, so is prevention,&quot; Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. &quot;And the
most important aspect of our prevention efforts is the development of voluntary compliance
guidance that will help the health care industry understand the government's expectations
for a well-run compliance program.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The draft guidance -- <em>Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities</em> -- went
on public display today and is scheduled for publication as a notice in the Oct. 29, 1999,
<em>Federal Register</em>. There will be a 30-day comment period following publication.
After reviewing and incorporating the comments as appropriate, the Office of Inspector
General will publish a final version of the voluntary compliance guidance in the <em>Federal
Register</em>. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&quot;I encourage the nursing home industry, patient advocates and other interested
parties to comment on the draft guidance,&quot; Inspector General Brown said.
&quot;Working collaboratively with the industry and others will help ensure we create the
best final product possible.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Similar to other guidance already issued by the Office of Inspector General for clinical
laboratories, hospitals, home health agencies, third-party medical billing companies,
durable-medical equipment suppliers and hospices, the draft guidance is based on the
following seven elements: 1) implementation of written policies, procedures and standards
of conduct; 2) designation of a compliance officer; 3) development of training and
education programs; 4) creation of a hotline or other measures for receiving complaints
and procedures for protecting callers from retaliation; 5) performance of internal audits
to monitor compliance; 6) enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary
directives; and 7) prompt corrective action in response to detected offenses. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The Office of Inspector General recognizes the complexities of the nursing home industry
and is sensitive to the differences among large national chains, regional multi-facility
operators and small independent homes. The draft guidance is intended for all nursing
facilities whether for-profit or nonprofit, large or small, urban or rural, with the
expectation that each nursing facility will tailor a compliance program to meet its
particular needs. Throughout the draft guidance there are suggestions on how small nursing
facilities can design effective voluntary compliance programs. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The draft guidance identifies specific compliance risk areas for nursing facilities,
including quality of care, residents' rights, employee screening, vendor relationships,
billing and cost reporting, and record keeping and documentation. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&quot;The draft guidance stresses the importance of compliance with quality of care
standards because nursing home residents are often among the most vulnerable beneficiaries
receiving care through Medicare and Medicaid,&quot; Inspector General Brown said. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
To safeguard against inappropriate practices, the draft guidance recommends that nursing
facilities, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure there is a comprehensive, accurate assessment of each resident's functional
    capacity and a comprehensive care plan that includes measurable objectives to meet
    residents' medical, mental and psychosocial needs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Report incidents of mistreatment, neglect or abuse to the administrator of the facility
    and other officials as required by law.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Refrain from discriminatory admissions or improper denial of care; verbal, mental or
    physical abuse, corporal punishment and involuntary seclusion; and inappropriate use of
    physical or chemical restraints.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Refrain from billing for items or services not rendered or provided as claimed;
    submitting claims for equipment, medical supplies and services that are medically
    unnecessary; submitting claims for items or services not ordered; and knowingly billing
    for inadequate or substandard care.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Investigate the background of employees by checking with all applicable licensing and
    certification authorities to verify that requisite licenses and certifications are in
    order; and require all potential employees to certify that they have not been convicted of
    an offense that would preclude employment and that they are not excluded from
    participation in the federal health care programs.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The Office of Inspector General maintains a list of excluded individuals/entities on the
    World Wide Web at <em>www.hhs.gov/oig/cumsan/index.htm</em> and recommends that nursing
    facilities check the list before hiring or contracting with individuals or entities.
    Additionally, the Office of Inspector General recommends that nursing facilities
    periodically check the list to determine the exclusion status of current employees and
    contractors. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Refrain from routinely waiving coinsurance or deductible amounts without a good faith
    determination that the resident is in financial need; and refrain from soliciting or
    accepting any gift or gratuity of more than nominal value from residents, potential
    referral sources and other individuals and entities with which the nursing facility has a
    business relationship. Likewise, the facility should refrain from offering any gift of
    more than nominal value to residents or potential referral sources.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain all records and documentation, including billing and claims information,
    required for participation in federal, state and private health care programs, including
    the resident assessment instrument, the comprehensive plan of care and all corrective
    actions taken in response to surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p>The draft nursing facility guidance also includes information on how to assess the
effectiveness of a compliance program. The government views the existence of a compliance
program as a mitigating factor in fraud and abuse cases only if the compliance program is
&quot;effective.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Documentation is key to demonstrating the effectiveness of a provider's compliance
program. For example, the Office of Inspector General strongly recommends maintaining
documentation of the following: audit results; hotline calls and their resolution; due
diligence efforts of business transactions; employee training, including the number of
hours; disciplinary actions; and distribution of policies and procedures. The documented
practice of refunding overpayments and self-disclosing incidents of non-compliance with
federal health care program requirements can also provide evidence of an effective
compliance program. <br wp="br1">
