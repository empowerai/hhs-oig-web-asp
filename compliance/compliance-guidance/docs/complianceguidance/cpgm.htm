<p align="center"><strong>DRAFT COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</strong> </p>

<p align="center"><strong>FOR MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS OFFERING COORDINATED CARE
PLANS</strong> </p>

<p align="center"><a name="I. INTRODUCTION"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </a></p>

<p>In its ongoing effort to work collaboratively with the health care industry to achieve
the mutual goals of quality health care and the elimination of fraud, waste and abuse, the
Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has
encouraged voluntarily developed and implemented compliance programs for the health care
industry. As a demonstration of the OIG's commitment to compliance, the OIG has issued
recommendations, in the form of compliance program guidances, that provide suggestions
regarding how specific segments of the industry can best implement compliance programs.<a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p>

<p>As a result of the changing nature of the health care delivery system and the growing
trend toward reliance on the managed care industry in the provision of such health care
delivery, the OIG believes it is appropriate to issue a guidance focusing on
Medicare+Choice organizations<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>offering coordinated care
plans<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (Medicare+Choice organizations). The OIG believes
that the implementation of compliance plans in the managed care industry can provide a
mechanism for further improving the quality, productivity and efficiency of the health
care industry as a whole. This guidance is intended to assist Medicare+Choice
organizations and their agents and subcontractors in developing effective internal
controls that promote adherence to applicable Federal and State law and the program
requirements of Federal health plans. </p>

<p>While the regulations implementing the Medicare+Choice program, or Part C, require a
Medicare+Choice organization to establish a compliance plan,<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
the OIG's program guidance is voluntary and simply is intended to provide assistance for
Medicare+Choice organizations looking for additional direction in the development and
implementation of a compliance program. As such, this guidance addresses the OIG's view on
comprehensive compliance programs pertaining to Medicare+Choice organizations. <br>
<br wp="br1">
The OIG formulated this guidance specifically for Medicare+Choice organizations because
these organizations are well-defined and somewhat limited in the statutory and regulatory
jurisdiction of the States, as evidenced by the pre-emption provisions.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
In this guidance, we have focused our attention on Federal health care regulations
governing marketing, enrollment, disenrollment, underutilization, data collection,
anti-kickback statute and anti-dumping, rather than providing instruction on all aspects
of regulatory compliance. The OIG encourages managed care organizations to read the
guidance with the whole organization in mind, applying the guidance to whatever
departments or divisions, including private-sector managed care areas, that are deemed
appropriate. Indeed, many of the suggestions in this guidance can be used by managed care
organizations that do not contract with HCFA. In particular, entities that participate in
other public health care programs, such as Medicaid, may want to look to the general
principles in this document to assist them in developing compliance programs. </p>

<p>Within this document, the OIG first provides its general views on the value and
fundamental principles of Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs, and then
provides specific elements that each Medicare+Choice organization should consider when
developing and implementing an effective compliance program. </p>

<p>Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within an
organization that promotes prevention, detection and resolution of instances of conduct
that do not conform to Federal and State law and Federal health care program requirements,
as well as the Medicare+Choice organization's ethical and business policies. In practice,
the compliance program should effectively articulate and demonstrate the organization's
commitment to legal and ethical conduct. Eventually, a compliance program should become
part of the fabric of a Medicare+Choice organization's routine operations. </p>

<p>It is incumbent upon a Medicare+Choice organization's officers and managers to provide
ethical leadership to the organization and to assure adequate systems and resources are in
place to facilitate and promote ethical and legal conduct. Employees, managers and the
Government will focus on the words and actions (including decisions made on resources
devoted to compliance) of a Medicare+Choice organization's leadership as a measure of the
organization's commitment to compliance. Indeed, many organizations have adopted mission
statements articulating their commitment to high ethical standards. </p>

<p>Implementing an effective compliance program requires a substantial commitment of time,
energy and resources by senior management and the Medicare+Choice organization's governing
body. Superficial programs that simply purport to comply with the elements discussed and
described in this guidance, or programs hastily constructed and implemented without
appropriate ongoing monitoring, will likely be ineffective and could expose the
Medicare+Choice organization to greater liability than no program at all. Although an
effective compliance program may require significant additional resources or a
reallocation of existing resources, the long term benefits of implementing such a program
significantly outweigh the costs. Undertaking a compliance program is a beneficial
investment that advances the Medicare+Choice organization, the health of Medicare+Choice
enrollees and the stability and solvency of the Medicare program. </p>

<p><a name="A. BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM"><strong>A. <u>BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE
PROGRAM</u></strong> </a></p>

<p>The OIG believes an effective compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the
public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse,
improving operational quality, improving the quality of health care and reducing the costs
of health care. Attaining these goals provides positive results to business, Government,
individual citizens and Medicare beneficiaries alike. In addition to fulfilling its legal
duty to ensure that it is not submitting false or inaccurate information to the Government
or providing substandard care to Medicare beneficiaries, a Medicare+Choice organization
may gain numerous additional benefits by implementing an effective compliance program.
These benefits may include: </p>

<p>o The formulation of effective internal controls to assure compliance with Federal
regulations and internal guidelines; </p>

<p>o Improved collaboration, communication and cooperation between health care providers
and the Medicare+Choice organization, as well as within the Medicare+Choice organization
itself; </p>

<p>o Improved communication with and satisfaction of Medicare+Choice enrollees; </p>

<p>o The ability to more quickly and accurately react to employees' operational compliance
concerns and the capability to effectively target resources to address those concerns; </p>

<p>o A concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the
Medicare+Choice organization's strong commitment to honest and responsible corporate
conduct; </p>

<p>o The ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior
relating to fraud and abuse; </p>

<p>o Improved (clinical and non-clinical) quality of care and service; </p>

<p>o Improved assessment tools that could affect many or all of the Medicare+Choice
organization's divisions or departments; </p>

<p>o Increased likelihood of identification and prevention of unlawful and unethical
conduct; </p>

<p>o A centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes,
regulations and other program directives related to fraud and abuse; </p>

<p>o An environment that encourages employees to report potential problems; </p>

<p>o Procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of possible misconduct by
corporate officers, managers, employees and independent contractors; </p>

<p>o An improved relationship with the Center for Health Plans and Providers (CHPP) at
HCFA; </p>

<p>o Early detection and reporting, minimizing the loss to the Government from false
claims, and thereby reducing the Medicare+Choice organization's exposure to civil damages
and penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion;<a
href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and </p>

<p>o An enhancement of the structure of the Medicare+Choice organization's separate
business units. </p>

<p>Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is a sound business
investment that has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the
Medicare+Choice organization. It may also improve the Medicare+Choice organization's
financial structure by addressing not only fraud and abuse concerns, but efficiency and
productivity concerns in other operational areas. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes the implementation of an effective compliance program may not
entirely eliminate fraud, abuse and waste from an organization. However, a sincere effort
by a Medicare+Choice organization to comply with applicable Federal and State standards,
through the establishment of an effective compliance program, significantly reduces the
probability of unlawful or improper conduct. </p>

<p><a name="B. APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE"><strong>B. <u>APPLICATION OF
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</u></strong> </a></p>

<p>Before explaining the specific elements of a compliance program, it is important to
emphasize several aspects of this document: its voluntary nature, its applicability to
Medicare+Choice organizations that offer coordinated care plans, the collaborative nature
by which it was developed, and its evolving nature. </p>

<p>First, it should be re-emphasized that while the regulations implementing the
Medicare+Choice program, or Part C, require a Medicare+Choice organization to establish a
compliance plan, including specified elements,<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> this
program guidance is voluntary. Although this document presents basic procedural and
structural guidance for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself a compliance
program. Rather, it is a set of guidelines for consideration by a Medicare+Choice
organization interested in obtaining specific information on implementing a compliance
program. This guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how a Medicare+Choice
organization can establish internal controls and monitor company conduct to correct and
prevent fraudulent activities. </p>

<p>It is critical for the Medicare+Choice organization to assess its own organization and
determine its needs with regard to compliance with applicable Federal and State statutes
and Federal health care program requirements. By no means should the contents of this
guidance be viewed as an exclusive discussion of the advisable components of a compliance
program. On the contrary, the OIG strongly encourages Medicare+Choice organizations to
develop and implement compliance components that uniquely address the individual
organization's risk areas. </p>

<p>Implementing a compliance program in the managed care industry is a complicated
venture. There are significant variances and complexities among Medicare+Choice
organizations in terms of the type of services and the manner in which these services are
provided to the respective members. For example, some Medicare+Choice organizations cover
broad service areas, while others are focused on a particular geographic region.
Similarly, the range of benefits covered differ among plans. Clearly, these differences
may give rise to different substantive policies to ensure effective compliance.
Furthermore, some Medicare+Choice organizations are relatively small (such as
provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs)), while others are fully integrated and offer
Medicare+Choice plans<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> in a wide variety of areas.
Finally, the availability of resources for any one Medicare+Choice organization can differ
vastly. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding these differences, this guidance is pertinent for all Medicare+Choice
organizations, large or small, regardless of the type of services provided. The
applicability of the recommendations and guidelines provided in this document may depend
on the circumstances and resources of each particular Medicare+Choice organization.
However, regardless of the organization's size and structure, the OIG believes every
Medicare+Choice organization can and should strive to accomplish the objectives and major
principles underlying all of the compliance policies and procedures recommended within
this guidance. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the success of the compliance program guidance hinges on
thoughtful and practical comments from those individuals and organizations that will
utilize the tools set forth in this document. In a continuing effort to collaborate
closely with the private sector, the OIG solicited input and support from the public in
the development of this compliance program guidance.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
Further, we took into consideration previous OIG publications, such as Special Fraud
Alerts, the recent findings and recommendations in reports issued by OIG's Office of Audit
Services (OAS) and Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI),<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
comments from HCFA, as well as the experience of past and recent fraud investigations
related to managed care organizations<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>conducted by
OIG's Office of Investigations (OI) and the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>As appropriate, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more information and
knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the law, and in the rules, policies
and procedures of the Federal and State plans occur. The OIG understands Medicare+Choice
organizations will need adequate time to react to these modifications and expansions and
to make any necessary changes to their voluntary compliance programs. New compliance
practices may eventually be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG discovers
significant enhancements to better ensure an effective compliance program. We recognize
the development and implementation of compliance programs in Medicare+Choice organizations
often raise sensitive and complex legal and managerial issues.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is critical guidance for those who are
sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant health care statutes and regulations. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS"><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
ELEMENTS</strong> </a></p>

<p>The elements proposed by these guidelines are similar to those of the other OIG
Compliance Program Guidances<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> and our corporate
integrity agreements.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> As noted above, the elements
represent a guide that can be tailored to fit the needs and financial realities of a
particular Medicare+Choice organization, large or small, regardless of the type of
services offered. </p>

<p>Every effective compliance program must begin with a formal commitment<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
by the Medicare+Choice organization's governing body to include <u>all</u> of the
applicable elements listed below. A good faith and meaningful commitment on the part of
the Medicare+Choice organization's administration, especially the governing body and the
chief executive officer (CEO), will substantially contribute to the program's successful
implementation. These elements are based on the seven steps of the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> We believe every Medicare+Choice
organization can implement all of the recommended elements and expand upon them, as
appropriate. </p>

<p>At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include the following seven
elements: </p>

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as
written policies and procedures, that promote the Medicare+Choice organization's
commitment to compliance and that address specific areas of potential fraud (<u>e.g.</u>,
the marketing process, and underutilization); </p>

<p>(2) The designation of a chief compliance officer and other appropriate bodies, <u>e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee, charged with the responsibility of operating and
monitoring the compliance program and who report directly to the CEO and the governing
body; </p>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training
programs for all affected employees; </p>

<p>(4) The development of effective lines of communication between the compliance officer
and all employees, including a process, such as a hotline, to receive complaints (and the
adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of complainants and to protect callers
from retaliation); </p>

<p>(5) The use of audits or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and
assist in the reduction of identified problem areas; </p>

<p>(6) The development of disciplinary mechanisms to consistently enforce standards and
the development of policies addressing dealings with sanctioned and other specified
individuals; and </p>

<p>(7) The development of policies to respond to detected offenses and to initiate
corrective action to prevent similar offenses. </p>

<p><a name="A. WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES"><strong>A. <u>WRITTEN POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES</u></strong> </a></p>

<p>Every compliance program should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies, standards and practices that identify specific areas of risk and
vulnerability to the Medicare+Choice organization. These policies should be developed
under the direction and supervision of the chief compliance officer and the compliance
committee and, at a minimum, should be provided to all individuals who are affected by the
particular policy at issue, including the Medicare+Choice organization's agents and
independent contractors.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations maintain ultimate responsibility for adhering to and
otherwise fully complying with all terms and conditions of their contract with HCFA.<a
href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> It is with this in mind that the OIG strongly recommends
that the Medicare+Choice organization coordinate with its first tier and downstream
providers to establish compliance responsibilities,<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> in
addition to the contractual responsibilities required by HCFA.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
For example, OIG recommends that the Medicare+Choice organization coordinate with its
contracting providers regarding the steps that should be taken by the providers to verify
and confirm to the Medicare+Choice organization the accuracy of information and data
submitted to the Medicare+Choice organization concerning patient encounters and
fee-for-service claims. Once the responsibilities have been clearly delineated, they
should be formalized in legally enforceable written arrangement between the health care
provider and the Medicare+Choice organization. The OIG recommends this document enumerate
those functions that are shared responsibilities and those that are the sole
responsibility of the Medicare+Choice organization. </p>

<p><a name="1. Standards of Conduct"><strong>1. Standards of Conduct</strong> </a></p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should develop standards of conduct for all affected
employees that include a clearly delineated commitment to compliance by the organization's
senior management and its divisions. To help communicate a strong and explicit
organizational commitment to compliance goals and standards, the Medicare+Choice
organization's governing body, CEO, chief operating officer (COO), general counsel, chief
financial officer (CFO) and other senior officials should be directly involved in the
development of standards of conduct. </p>

<p>The standards should function in the same fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a
foundational document that details the fundamental principles, values and framework for
action within an organization, as well as the organization's mission and goals. The
standards should also articulate the Medicare+Choice organization's commitment to comply
with all Federal and State standards, with an emphasis on preventing fraud and abuse. The
standards should not only address compliance with statutes and regulations, but should
also set forth broad principles that guide employees in conducting business professionally
and properly. In short, the standards should promote integrity, support objectivity and
foster trust. Furthermore, a Medicare+Choice organization's standards of conduct should
reflect a commitment to the highest quality health care delivery, as evidenced by its
quality, reliability and timeliness. </p>

<p><a name="2. Written Policies for Risk Areas"><strong>2. Written Policies</strong> <strong>for
Risk Areas</strong> </a></p>

<p>As part of its commitment to compliance, Medicare+Choice organizations should establish
a comprehensive set of written policies that address all applicable statutes, rules and
program instructions that apply to each function or department of the Medicare+Choice
organization.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>The policies should address specific
areas of concern, such as marketing practices and data collection and submission
processes. In contrast to the standards of conduct, which are designed to be a clear and
concise collection of fundamental standards, the written policies should articulate
specific procedures personnel should follow when performing their duties. </p>

<p>In order to determine what policies and procedures are needed, the OIG recommends that
Medicare+Choice organizations conduct a comprehensive self-administered risk analysis or
contract for an independent risk analysis by experienced health care consulting
professionals. This risk analysis should identify and rank the various compliance and
business risks the company may experience in its daily operations. A Medicare+Choice
organization's prior history of noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations and
Federal health care program requirements may indicate additional types of risk areas where
the organization may be vulnerable and may require necessary policy measures to prevent
avoidable recurrence.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The fact that Medicare+Choice organizations may be both providers and insurers of
health care increases the number and type of risk areas to which a Medicare+Choice
organization must be attuned, as well as the type of auditing and monitoring procedures
that must be implemented, in the development of its compliance efforts. For example, an
individual Medicare+Choice organization may contract with a variety of providers with
different specialities and, consequently, must consider a variety of different risk areas.
</p>

<p>The regulations and operational policies issued by HCFA that implement the
Medicare+Choice program are very comprehensive and should serve as the basis for the
policies and procedures of a Medicare+Choice organization.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
The legal and policy requirements that organizations must meet to qualify as a
Medicare+Choice organization are articulated in documentation promulgated by HCFA and
other Federal agencies and should be considered de facto risk areas. Included among these
risk areas are: (1) the election process; (2) benefits and beneficiary protections; (3)
quality assurance; (4) premiums and cost sharing; (5) solvency, licensure and other state
regulatory issues; (6) claims processing; and (7) appeals and grievance procedures. Given
the detailed nature of the rules and regulations, we have not attempted in this document
to identify each and every policy that should be established by a Medicare+Choice
organization. Rather, based on a review OIG audits, investigations and evaluations, we
have identified the following areas of particular concern to OIG that the Medicare+Choice
organization should consider in developing its written policies and procedures:<a
href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Marketing materials and personnel; </p>

<p>o Selective marketing and enrollment; </p>

<p>o Disenrollment; </p>

<p>o Underutilization and quality of care; </p>

<p>o Data collection and submission processes; </p>

<p>o Anti-kickback statute and other inducements; and </p>

<p>o Anti-dumping statute. </p>

<p>As note above, the list is not all-encompassing and the Medicare+Choice organization
should conduct additional surveys and statistical analysis specifically tailored to the
organization's beneficiary population and organizational structure.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The following sections provide specific guidance regarding the types of policies that
should be implemented by Medicare+Choice organizations. </p>

<p><a name="a. Marketing Materials and Personnel"><strong>a. Marketing Materials and
Personnel</strong> </a></p>

<p>While each Medicare+Choice organization must comply with all of HCFA's detailed
requirements relating to marketing their plans,<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> OIG is
particularly concerned that organizations have policies regarding: (1) the completeness
and accuracy of the marketing materials; and (2) marketing personnel. </p>

<p>Accurate and useful information is crucial to the success of the Medicare+Choice
program. OIG is very concerned that Medicare+Choice organizations correctly and completely
describe plan information in any marketing materials or other materials distributed to
individuals once enrolled in the plan. Medicare+Choice organizations that misrepresent or
falsify information submitted to HCFA, individuals or entities are subject to civil
monetary penalties (CMPs).<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The submission of inaccurate or misleading information is of particular concern in
light of the recent study conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO) that examined
16 managed care organizations and found that all organizations had distributed materials
containing inaccurate or incomplete benefit information.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
It should be noted that HCFA had reviewed and approved the materials from all the
organizations in the GAO study. Given this finding, Medicare+Choice organizations should
take special care to ensure that all marketing materials are accurate, notwithstanding
whether the materials have been approved by HCFA.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> </p>

<p>HCFA considers marketing materials to include any material used by a Medicare+Choice
organization to contact a Medicare beneficiary. As such, marketing materials go beyond the
public's general conception of marketing materials and include general circulation
brochures, leaflets, newspapers, magazines, television, radio, billboards, yellow pages,
the Internet, slides and charts, and leaflets for distribution by providers. Such
materials also include membership communication materials such as membership rules,
subscriber agreements, or confirmation of enrollment.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>
Accordingly, Medicare+Choice organizations should carefully scrutinize all of these
materials for completeness, accuracy and compliance with HCFA rules. </p>

<p>In verifying that marketing materials meet all HCFA requirements, Medicare+Choice
organizations should ensure that the materials contain an adequate written description of
rules, procedures, basis benefits and services, and an explanation of the grievance and
appeals process.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a> Of particular concern to HCFA and OIG
is that the concept of &quot;lock-in&quot; is clearly explained in all marketing material.
Many Medicare beneficiaries are unfamiliar with the notion that managed care may limit
their health care provider choices. Describing the process of selecting a primary care
physician and the limitations that this places on a Medicare+Choice enrollee's choice of
provider will significantly reduce the unmet expectations of Medicare beneficiaries. </p>

<p>Another important concept to include in the marketing materials is the fact that the
beneficiary may be terminated from enrollment in the plan due to the decision of the
Medicare+Choice organization not to renew its contract with HCFA, or due to HCFA's
decision to refuse to renew the contract.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> This
termination can affect the enrollee's<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> eligibility for
supplemental insurance and other benefits. </p>

<p>Second, in light of the critical role that marketing personnel play in representing the
plan to Medicare enrollees, the Medicare+Choice organization must take all appropriate
steps to ensure that marketing personnel are presenting clear, complete and accurate
information to potential enrollees. To that end, OIG strongly encourages Medicare+Choice
organizations to employ their own marketing personnel, as opposed to contracting these
responsibilities to outside entities.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>This provides the
Medicare+Choice organization the necessary control to ensure that these individuals meet
all HCFA guidelines. Similarly, it safeguards Medicare beneficiaries from practices that
could seriously endanger their access to health care to which they are entitled, and their
ability to acquire accurate and complete information regarding their health care options. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should also be aware that OIG and HCFA strongly
discourage the use of physicians as marketing agents for several reasons: (1) physicians
are usually not fully aware of membership plan benefits and costs; (2) physicians may not
be the best source of membership information about their patients; (3) when a physician
acts outside his or her traditional role as care provider, the physician's patients may be
confused as to when the physician is acting as an agent of the plan, and when the
physician is acting to further the interests of the patient; and (4) a physician's
knowledge of a patient's health status increases the potential for discriminating in favor
of Medicare beneficiaries with positive health status when acting as a marketing agent.<a
href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a><strong> </strong>Therefore, the organization should
develop procedures to prevent the use of physicians in this way. </p>

<p><a name="b. Selective Marketing and Enrollment"><strong>b. Selective Marketing and
Enrollment</strong> </a></p>

<p>OIG is very concerned about the practice known as &quot;cherry-picking,&quot; or
selective marketing,<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>in which Medicare+Choice
organizations discriminate in the marketing and enrollment process based upon an
enrollee's degree of risk for costly or prolonged treatment.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
Except for individuals who have been medically determined to have end-stage renal disease,
a Medicare+Choice organization may not deny, limit or condition the coverage or furnishing
of benefits to individuals eligible to enroll in a Medicare+Choice plan offered by the
organization on the basis of any factor that is related to health status, including, but
not limited to, the following: (1) medical condition (including mental illness); (2)
claims experience; (3) receipt of health care; (4) medical history; (5) genetic
information; (6) evidence of insurability; and (7) disability.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
Engaging in practices that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or
discouraging enrollment by eligible individuals whose medical condition or history
indicates the need for substantial future medical services subjects the Medicare+Choice
organization to a CMP.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Certain types of practices clearly fall into the category of cherry-picking and
Medicare+Choice organizations should implement policies to prohibit such practices. For
example, organizations should prohibit employees from conducting medical screening, <u>i.e.</u>,
asking the beneficiary medical questions prior to enrollment.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>
In a 1996 survey, the OIG found that such screening for health status at application was
reported by 18 percent of beneficiaries. While this represented a reduction from the 1993
level of 43 percent, it still represents a potentially serious problem.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Another way in which Medicare+Choice organizations may inappropriately target healthier
beneficiaries is by marketing their plans in places where healthy enrollees would be more
likely to be present, such as at health and exercise clubs, or in areas that are difficult
to access for people with disabilities (<u>e.g.</u>, upper floors of buildings that do not
have elevators).<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> Similarly, organizations may
inappropriately provide inducements to potential enrollees in a way that would encourage
younger, healthier beneficiaries to enroll in the plan. For example, the offering of free
gym memberships or kayaking or other sporting lessons would appeal to a healthy class of
enrollees and discriminate against those who would not be interested in such activities.<a
href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Other examples of cherry-picking would be: (1) attempts to give enrollment priority to
newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries (who are theoretically younger and healthier); (2)
the tracking of costs incurred by enrollees who were enrolled in different settings (<u>e.g.</u>,
at the health fair, or at a health club), which could be used to target healthier
enrollees in the future; or (3) re-enrollment campaigns targeting past plan subscribers
who had low medical costs. There are many other subtle ways in which a Medicare+Choice
organization may try to enroll healthy patient populations and the organization should
implement policies to prohibit such practices. </p>

<p><a name="c. Disenrollment"><strong>c. Disenrollment</strong> </a></p>

<p>In general, Medicare+Choice organizations are prohibited from disenrolling, or
requesting or encouraging (either by action or inaction) an individual to disenroll from
any plan it offers.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> If a Medicare+Choice organization
acts to expel or refuses to reenroll an individual in violation of the statute, a civil
monetary penalty can be imposed on the organization.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
OIG is particularly concerned about disenrollment in light of its recent review, which
revealed that there was a problem with disenrollment of beneficiaries just prior to
receiving expensive inpatient services.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In this review, OIG found that Medicare paid for inpatient hospital services amounting
to $224 million in fee-for-service (FFS) payments within three months of beneficiaries'
disenrollment from six risk plans during 1991 through 1996. Had these beneficiaries not
disenrolled, Medicare would have paid the HMOs $20 million in monthly capitation payments.
Had the beneficiaries remained in the HMOs, Medicare would have saved $204 million in
expenditures. Included in the Medicare FFS payments were $41 million for beneficiaries who
disenrolled, had FFS procedures performed, and then reenrolled into another or the same
managed care plan. </p>

<p>While this study did not identify the reasons for the disenrollment as part of this
review, one partial explanation of the review is that some managed care plans may be
encouraging sicker beneficiaries to disenroll as a way to avert their own costs at a high
cost to the Medicare system. </p>

<p>Each Medicare+Choice organization must implement policies to ensure that inappropriate
disenrollment does not occur. Such policies should include clarification of when it is
appropriate for medical personnel to discuss the concept of disenrollment. Generally
speaking, OIG believes it would be inappropriate for medical personnel to initiate
discussion of disenrollment or to promote disenrollment except in the rare circumstance
where the Medicare+Choice organization cannot provide the covered medical items or
services needed by the patient. </p>

<p><a name="d.Underutilization and Quality of Care"><strong>d.Underutilization and Quality
of Care</strong> </a></p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations must ensure that all covered services are available and
accessible to all enrollees.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> OIG views the
inappropriate withholding or delay of services, known as underutilization or
&quot;stinting,&quot; as a serious concern.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> Examples
of practices that can lead to underutilization and poor quality include the failure to
employ or contract with sufficient institutional and individual providers to accommodate
all enrollees, the failure to provide geographically reachable services to enrollees, the
delay in approving or failure to approve referrals for covered services, the establishment
of utilization review procedures that are so burdensome that an enrollee could not
reasonably be expected to fulfill the requirements, and the categorical denial of payment
of claims. <br>
<br wp="br1">
There are a wide variety of policies that a Medicare+Choice organization should implement
to be sure it is providing all medically necessary services to its enrollees. The
regulations and guidelines that implement the Medicare+Choice program contain numerous
provisions that deal with this issue. While we have not attempted to develop a
comprehensive list in this document, we would like to highlight three types of policies
that Medicare+Choice organizations should develop that may help address underutilization
and quality of care. </p>

<p>First, Medicare+Choice organizations should have policies that prohibit interference
with health care professionals' advice to enrollees. Also known as the &quot;gag
rule,&quot; this prohibition extends to advice regarding the patient's health status,
medical care, and treatment options, the risks, benefits and consequences of treatment or
non-treatment, or the opportunity for the individual to refuse treatment and to express
preferences about future treatment options.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> Failure to
comply with this requirement can lead to sanctions.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Second, Medicare+Choice organizations should be sure, to they extent that they utilize
physician incentive plans (PIPs) in their payment arrangements with individual physicians
or physician groups, that they comply with all applicable regulations. PIPs raise
utilization concerns because they are defined as &quot;any compensation arrangement that
may directly or indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services provided to
plan enrollees.&quot;<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> Any PIP operated by a
Medicare+Choice organization must comply with the following requirements. First, it may
make no payments to physicians (such as offerings of monetary value, including, but not
limited to, stock options or waivers of debt<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>) to
reduce or limit medically necessary services. Second, if the PIP puts a physician or
physician group at &quot;substantial financial risk&quot;<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
for referral services, the Medicare+Choice organization must: (1) survey current and
previously enrolled members to assess access to and satisfaction with the quality of
services; and (2) assure that there is adequate and appropriate stop-loss protection.<a
href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> Finally, Medicare+Choice organizations must disclose
certain information regarding their PIPs. These disclosure requirements apply to direct
contracting arrangements, as well as subcontracting arrangements.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In general, Medicare+Choice organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure
that they comply with the Guidance on Disclosure of Physician Incentive Plan, the Guidance
on Surveys required by the Physician Incentive Plan Regulation and the Physician Incentive
Plan Regulation Requirements.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Finally, OIG is aware of cases in which beneficiaries have received covered services
from individuals that were not appropriately licensed. Given the serious quality of care
implications of this type of practice, OIG is particularly concerned that Medicare+Choice
organizations have procedures for the selection of providers, including criteria for the
credentialing of providers. This process should include an application, verification of
information and a site visit, where applicable.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> The
information that must be verified includes that the individual has a valid license to
practice, clinical privileges in good standing and appropriate educational qualifications.
</p>

<p><a name="e. Data Collection and Submission Processes"><strong>e. Data Collection and
Submission Processes</strong> </a></p>

<p>The regulations implementing the Medicare+Choice program contain numerous requirements
relating to the data collection and submission process, ranging from a requirement for an
effective system for receiving, controlling, and processing election forms<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
to requirements for the timely submission of disenrollment notices.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
These requirements cover the gamut of requirements with which a Medicare+Choice
organization must comply and are too detailed to enumerate in this document.
Medicare+Choice organizations should establish a policy that all required submissions to
HCFA be accurate, timely and complete and that all appropriate reporting requirements are
met.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a> </p>

<p>OIG is particularly concerned that Medicare+Choice organizations submit accurate
information when that data determines the amount of payment received from HCFA. The
regulations require that when a Medicare+Choice organization requests payment under the
contract, the CEO or CFO must certify the accuracy, completeness and truthfulness of
relevant data, including enrollment data, encounter data, and information provided as part
of an adjusted community rate (ACR) proposal.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a> When a
Medicare+Choice organization submits this type of data to HCFA, it is making a
&quot;claim&quot; for capitation payment in the amount dictated by the data submitted, or
in the case of the ACR submission, a &quot;claim&quot; to retain the portion of the
capitation amount that is under the ACR amount, rather than providing additional benefits.
When a Medicare+Choice organization is claiming payment (or the right to retain payment)
based upon information submitted to HCFA, it must take responsibility for having taken
reasonable steps to assure the accuracy of this information. The attestation forms
developed by HCFA for this purpose require certification that the information submitted is
true and accurate based on best knowledge, information, and belief. </p>

<p>The requirement that the CEO or CFO certify as to the accuracy, completeness and
truthfulness of data, based on best knowledge, information and belief, does not constitute
an absolute guarantee of accuracy. Rather, it creates a duty on the Medicare+Choice
organization to put in place an information collection and reporting system reasonably
designed to yield accurate information. Furthermore, the Medicare+Choice organization must
conduct audits and spot checks of this system to verify whether it is yielding accurate
information. </p>

<p>The knowing submission of false information to HCFA can lead to serious criminal or
civil penalties.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> Medicare+Choice organizations should
be sure to implement policies so that the enrollment, encounter and ACR data submitted to
HCFA is accurate, complete and truthful. While information from a variety of sources can
affect this data, Medicare+Choice organizations should take note of two reports issued by
the OIG that have found problems in two pieces of this data. </p>

<p>First, OIG recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations have policies and procedures
in place that ensure that the administrative component of the ACR is calculated
accurately.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> As part of this process, Medicare+Choice
organizations should have clearly defined criteria for claiming reimbursement for their
administrative costs. These costs should not include any costs that are directly
associated with furnishing patient care. All such costs should be allocated to the
applicable operating component. The OIG has articulated serious concerns about the
methodology used by managed care organizations in computing their administrative rate on
the ACR proposal.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> For example, computing an
administrative rate based on the use of a medical utilization factor could generate a
payment that is almost three times what would be charged on the commercial side. The OIG
believes that the allocation of &quot;administration&quot; should be determined in
accordance with the Medicare program's longstanding principle that Medicare only pay its
applicable or fair share of needed costs. </p>

<p>Second, OIG recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations have adequate internal
controls in place to ensure that the institutional status of beneficiaries is reported
accurately.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a> A recent report issued by OIG estimated
that risk-based HMOs received Medicare overpayments of $22.2 million for beneficiaries
incorrectly classified as institutionalized.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> The
incorrect classification was largely due to deficiencies in the HMOs internal controls in
two areas: (1) verification of beneficiaries' institutional status; and (2) reporting of
institutional beneficiaries to HCFA. The results were based on audits of eight
statistically selected HMOs. </p>

<p><a name="f. Anti-kickback Statute and Other Inducements"><strong>f. Anti-kickback</strong>
<strong>Statute and Other Inducements</strong> </a></p>

<p>The anti-kickback statute provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that
knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration to induce the referral
of business reimbursable under a Federal health care program (including Medicare and
Medicaid).<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a> The anti-kickback statute potentially
applies to many managed care arrangements because a common strategy of these arrangements
is to offer physicians, hospitals and other providers increased patient volume in return
for substantial fee discounts. Because discounts to managed care organizations can
constitute &quot;remuneration&quot; within the meaning of the anti-kickback statute, a
number of health care providers have expressed concern that many relatively innocuous, or
even beneficial, commercial managed care arrangements implicate the statute and may
subject them to criminal prosecution and administrative sanctions. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that when managed care organizations are paid a capitated amount for
all of the services they provide regardless of the dates, frequency or type of services,
there is no incentive for them to overutilize. In any event, even if overutilization
occurs, the Federal health care programs are not at risk for these increased costs.
Accordingly, OIG will be issuing a safe harbor from the anti-kickback statute that will
provide protection for certain financial arrangements between managed care organizations
(including Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated care plans) and individuals
or entities with whom they contract for the provision of health care items or services,
where a Federal health care program pays such organizations on a capitated basis.<a
href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In general, the safe harbor protects payments between managed care organizations
(including Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated care plans) and individuals
or entities with which it has direct contracts to provide or arrange for the provision of
items or services.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a> While this is a broad exception,
there are three important limitations. </p>

<p>The first significant limitation is that there is no protection if the financial
arrangements under the managed care agreement are implicitly or explicitly part of a
broader agreement to steer fee-for-service Federal health care program business to the
entity giving the discount to induce the referral of managed care business. Specifically,
we understand that most managed care organizations have multiple relationships with their
contractors and subcontractors for the provision of services for various product lines,
including non-federal HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and point of service
networks. Consequently, although neither a managed care organization receiving a capitated
payment from a Federal health care program nor its contractors or subcontractors has an
incentive to overutilize items or services or pass additional costs back to the Federal
health care programs under the capitated arrangement, we are concerned that a managed care
organization or contractor may offer (or be offered) a reduced rate for its items or
services in the Federal capitated arrangement in order to have the opportunity to
participate in other product lines that do not have stringent payment or utilization
constraints. This practice is a form of a practice known as &quot;swapping;&quot; in the
case of managed care arrangements, low capitation rates could be traded for access to
additional fee-for-service lines of business. We are concerned when these discounts are in
exchange for access to fee-for-service lines of business, where there is an incentive to
overutilize services provided to Federal health care program beneficiaries. </p>

<p>For example, we would have concerns where an HMO with a Medicare risk contract under
Medicare Part C also has an employer-sponsored PPO that includes retirees and requires
participating providers to accept a low capitation rate for the Medicare HMO risk patients
in exchange for access to the Medicare fee-for-service patients in the PPO. Although in
such circumstances the cost to the Medicare program for the risk-based HMO beneficiaries
will not be increased, there may be increased expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries in
the PPO arrangement, because the providers may have an incentive to increase services to
the Medicare enrollees in the PPO to offset the discounted rates to the Medicare HMO.
Accordingly, such arrangements could violate the anti-kickback statute and should not be
protected. </p>

<p>A second limitation on the regulatory safe harbor protection is that it only applies to
remuneration for health care items and services and those items or services reasonably
related to the provision of health care items and services. It does not cover marketing
services or any services provided prior to a beneficiary's enrollment in a health plan. </p>

<p>Finally, the broad protection is limited to risk-based managed care plans that do not
claim any payment from a Federal health care program other than the capitated amount set
forth in the managed care organization's agreement with the Federal health care program.
Where the managed care plan, its contractors or its subcontractors are permitted to seek
additional payments from any of the Federal health care programs, the regulatory safe
harbor protection is significantly more limited. For example, protection is not extended
to arrangements with subcontractors when the contract under section 1876 of the Social
Security Act is cost-based or where the prime contract is protected solely because the
contracting entity is a Federally-qualified HMO. In the first instance, reimbursement from
the Federal health care program is based on costs, and in the latter case, services for
Medicare enrollees are reimbursed on a fee-for-services basis. In both instances,
reimbursement will increase with utilization, thus providing the same incentive to
overutilize as any fee-for-service payment methodology. </p>

<p>While the new safe harbor will provide protection from the anti-kickback statute for
most arrangements between Medicare+Choice organizations and their contractors,
Medicare+Choice organizations should also have policies in place that ensure that any
incentives offered to beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries do not run afoul of the
anti-kickback statute or the new civil monetary penalty relating to incentives to
beneficiaries.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a> The CMP was enacted in section 231(h)
of HIPAA (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5)) and imposes sanctions against individuals or
entities that offer remuneration to a program beneficiary that they know, or should know,
will influence the beneficiary's decision to order or receive items or services from a
particular provider, practitioner or supplier reimbursable by Medicare or the State health
care programs. </p>

<p>Pending the publication of the final rule implementing this CMP, we can provide the
following guidance. It is our view that organizations that provide incentives to Federal
health care program beneficiaries to enroll in a <u>plan</u> are not offering remuneration
to induce the enrollees to use a <u>particular provider, practitioner or</u> <u>supplier</u>.
Accordingly, we anticipate that organizations that provide incentives to enroll in a plan
will not be subject to sanctions under this provision. However, incentives provided by
organizations to induce a beneficiary to use a particular provider, practitioner or
supplier once the beneficiary has enrolled in a plan are within the purview of this CMP
and are prohibited if they do not meet an exception. For example, incentives given to
beneficiaries by a particular physician group within the physician panel of a
Medicare+Choice organization to encourage the beneficiary to use that physician group over
another physician in the panel would be prohibited. </p>

<p><a name="g. Anti-dumping"><strong>g. Anti-dumping</strong> </a></p>

<p>The OIG and HCFA believe that there may be special concerns regarding the provision of
emergency services to enrollees of Medicare+Choice plans. The anti-dumping statute<a
href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating
hospitals that offer emergency services to individuals presenting themselves at the
hospital seeking possible emergency treatment. While the obligations under the
anti-dumping statute prohibit a hospital from inquiring into the patient's method of
payment or insurance status, it has come to our attention that many hospitals routinely
seek authorization from a Medicare+Choice enrollee's primary care physician or from the
Medicare+Choice organization when a Medicare+Choice enrollee requests emergency services.
The OIG and HCFA are cognizant that many managed care organizations require their
enrollees to seek prior authorization for some medical services, including emergency
services and that there are circumstances when patients should be informed of their
potential financial liability. However, both the OIG and HCFA have concerns that a
Medicare+Choice enrollee may be unduly influenced by hospital personnel to leave the
hospital without obtaining necessary care.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a> </p>

<p>It is the view of OIG and HCFA that the anti-dumping statute requires that
notwithstanding the terms of any managed care contractual arrangements, the provisions of
the anti-dumping statute govern the obligations of hospitals to screen and provide
stabilizing treatment to any patient presenting at an emergency facility. No contract
between a hospital and managed care organization can excuse the hospital from the
anti-dumping statute obligations. Once a Medicare+Choice enrollee comes to the hospital
that offers emergency services, the law requires that the hospital must provide the
services required under the anti-dumping statute without regard to the patient's insurance
status or any prior authorization of such insurance. All Medicare+Choice organizations
should have policies in place to ensure that these requirements are met. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should be particularly careful of these requirements in
the event that they participate in the so-called &quot;dual staffing&quot; of emergency
departments. Dual staffing refers to the situation where hospitals have entered into
arrangements allowing a managed care organization to station its own physicians in the
hospital's emergency department for the purpose of screening and treating managed care
enrollees. Implementation of dual staffing raises some concerns under the anti-dumping
statute, particularly where different procedures and protocols have been established for
each staff. </p>

<p><a name="3. Retention of Records and Information Systems"><strong>3. Retention of
Records and Information Systems</strong> </a></p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs should provide for the
implementation of a records retention system. This system should establish policies and
procedures regarding the creation, distribution, retention, storage, retrieval and
destruction of documents. The three types of documents developed under this system should
include: (1) all records and documentation required by either Federal or State law and the
program requirements of Federal and State health plans; (2) records listing the persons
responsible for implementing each part of the compliance plan; and (3) all records
necessary to protect the integrity of the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance
process and confirm the effectiveness of the program. The documentation necessary to
satisfy the third requirement includes: evidence of adequate employee training; reports
from the Medicare+Choice organization's hotline; results of any investigation conducted as
a consequence of a hotline call; modifications to the compliance program; self-disclosure;
all written notifications to providers regarding compliance activities;<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>and
the results of the Medicare+Choice organization's auditing and monitoring efforts. </p>

<p>In light of the increasing reliance on electronic data interchange by the health care
industry, Medicare+Choice organizations should take particular care in establishing
procedures for maintaining the integrity of its data collection systems. This should
include procedures for regularly backing-up data (either by diskette, restricted system or
tape) collected in connection with all aspects of the Medicare+Choice program
requirements. </p>

<p><a name="4. Compliance as an Element of a Performance Plan"><strong>4. Compliance as an
Element of a Performance Plan</strong></a> </p>

<p>Compliance programs should require that the promotion of, and adherence to, the
elements of the compliance program be a factor in evaluating the performance of all
employees. Employees should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and
procedures. Policies should require that managers: </p>

<p>o Discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance
policies and legal requirements applicable to their function; </p>

<p>o Inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
requirements is a condition of employment; and </p>

<p>o Disclose to all supervised personnel that the Medicare+Choice organization will take
disciplinary action up to and including termination for violation of these policies or
requirements. </p>

<p>In addition to making performance of these duties an element in evaluations, the
compliance officer or company management should include a policy that managers and
supervisors will be sanctioned for failure to instruct adequately their subordinates or
for failure to detect noncompliance with applicable policies and legal requirements, where
reasonable diligence on the part of the manager or supervisor should have led to the
discovery of any problems or violations. </p>

<p><a name="B. DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE"><strong>B. <u>DESIGNATION
OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE</u></strong> </a></p>

<p><a name="1. Compliance Officer"><strong>1. Compliance Officer</strong> </a></p>

<p>Every Medicare+Choice organization should designate a compliance officer to serve as
the focal point for compliance activities. This responsibility may be the individual's
sole duty or added to other management responsibilities, depending upon the size and
resources of the Medicare+Choice organization and the complexity of the task. </p>

<p>Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate authority is critical to the
success of the program, necessitating the appointment of a high-level official in the
Medicare+Choice organization with direct access to the company's governing body, the CEO
and all other senior management and legal counsel.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
While it is important that the compliance officer have appropriate authority, we are not
suggesting that the compliance officer should have programmatic responsibility for the
various aspects of the Medicare+Choice program. For example, the compliance officer should
have full authority to stop the submission of data that he or she believes is problematic
until such time as the issue in question has been resolved. In addition, the compliance
officer should be copied on the results of all internal audit reports and work closely
with key managers to identify aberrant trends in the areas that require certification. The
compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other information
that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to, beneficiary
records (where appropriate) and records concerning the marketing efforts of the facility
and the Medicare+Choice organization arrangements with other parties, including employees,
professionals on staff, relevant independent contractors, suppliers, agents, supplemental
staffing entities and physicians. This policy enables the compliance officer to review
contracts and obligations (seeking the advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that
may contain referral and payment provisions that could violate statutory or regulatory
requirements. </p>

<p>Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance officer with
regard to planning, implementing and monitoring the compliance program. With this in mind,
the OIG recommends the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance officer closely
coordinate compliance functions with providers' compliance officers. </p>

<p>The compliance officer should have sufficient funding and staff to fully perform his or
her responsibilities. These duties should include: </p>

<p>o Overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program;<a
href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Reporting on a regular basis to the Medicare+Choice organization's governing body,
CEO and compliance committee on the progress of implementation and assisting these
components in establishing methods to improve the Medicare+Choice organization's
efficiency and quality of services and to reduce the Medicare+Choice organization's
vulnerability to fraud, abuse and waste; </p>

<p>o Periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs and
in the law and policies and procedures of Government and private payor health plans; </p>

<p>o Reviewing employees' certifications stating that they have received, read and
understood the standards of conduct; </p>

<p>o Developing, coordinating and participating in a multifaceted educational and training
program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program and seeks to ensure that
all appropriate employees and management are knowledgeable of, and comply with, pertinent
Federal and State standards; </p>

<p>o Coordinating personnel issues with the Medicare+Choice organization's human
resources/personnel office (or its equivalent) to ensure that providers and employees do
not appear in the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the GSA list of debarred
contractors;<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Assisting the Medicare+Choice organization's management in coordinating internal
compliance review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of
departments; </p>

<p>o Independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including
the flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding
to reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action with
all departments, providers and sub-providers, agents and, if appropriate, independent
contractors; <br wp="br1">
<br>
o Developing policies and programs that encourage managers and employees to report
suspected fraud and other improprieties without fear of retaliation; and </p>

<p>o Continuing the momentum of the compliance program and the accomplishment of its
objectives long after the initial years of implementation. </p>

<p><a name="2. Compliance Committee"><strong>2. Compliance Committee</strong> </a></p>

<p>The OIG recommends that a compliance committee be established to advise the compliance
officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
When assembling a team of people to serve as the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance
committee, the company should include individuals with a variety of skills.<a
href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a> The OIG strongly recommends that the compliance officer
manage the compliance committee. Once a managed care organization chooses the people that
will accept the responsibilities vested in members of the compliance committee, the
organization must train these individuals on the policies and procedures of the compliance
program. </p>

<p>The committee's responsibilities should include: </p>

<p>o Analyzing the organization's regulatory environment, the legal requirements with
which it must comply and specific risk areas; </p>

<p>o Assessing existing policies and procedures that address these </p>

<p>areas for possible incorporation into the compliance program; </p>

<p>o Working with appropriate departments, as well as affiliated providers, to develop
standards of conduct and policies and procedures that promote allegiance to the
organization's compliance program; </p>

<p>o Recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's standards,
policies and procedures as part of its daily operations; </p>

<p>o Determining the appropriate strategy/approach to promote compliance with the program
and detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other fraud
reporting mechanisms; </p>

<p>o Developing a system to solicit, evaluate and respond to complaints and problems; and </p>

<p>o Monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
identifying troublesome issues and deficient areas experienced by the Medicare+Choice
organization and implementing corrective and preventive action. </p>

<p>The committee may also address other functions as the compliance concept becomes part
of the overall operating structure and daily routine. </p>

<p><a name="C. CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION"><strong>C. <u>CONDUCTING
EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong> </a></p>

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, employees and the
continual retraining of current personnel at all levels are significant elements of an
effective compliance program. Where feasible, the Medicare+Choice organization should
afford outside contractors and its provider clients the opportunity to participate in the
organization's compliance training and educational programs. The contractors and provider
clients should be encouraged to develop their own compliance programs that complement the
Medicare+Choice organization's compliance program. </p>

<p><strong><a name="1. Formal Training Programs">1. Formal Training Programs</a> </strong></p>

<p>In order to ensure the appropriate information is being disseminated to the correct
individuals, the Medicare+Choice organization training program should include both a
general session and specialized sessions on specific risk areas. All employees should
attend the general session on compliance. Employees whose job responsibilities implicate
specific risk areas (<u>e.g.</u>, marketing or capitated reimbursement rules) should
attend the specialized sessions. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends attendance and participation at training programs be made a
condition of continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements
should result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is
serious. The Medicare+Choice organization should retain adequate records of its training
of employees, including attendance logs and material distributed at training sessions. New
employees should be targeted for training early in their employment, and to the extent
that they perform complicated tasks with greater organizational legal exposure, should be
monitored closely until all training is completed. </p>

<p><a name="a. General Sessions"><strong>a. General Sessions</strong> </a></p>

<p>As part of their compliance programs, Medicare+Choice organizations should require all
affected employees to attend annual training that emphasizes the organization's commitment
to compliance with all Federal and State statutes and requirements, and the policies of
private payors. This training should highlight the organization's compliance program,
summarize fraud and abuse statutes and regulations, Federal and State health care program
requirements, documentation requirements for data submission and marketing practices that
reflect current legal and program standards. </p>

<p>As part of the initial training, the standards of conduct should be distributed to all
employees. Every employee, as well as contracted consultants, should be required to sign
and date a statement that reflects the employee's knowledge of, and commitment to the
standards of conduct. This attestation should be retained in the employee's personnel
file. For contracted consultants, the attestation should become part of the contract and
remain in the<a name="training"></a> file that contains such documentation. To ensure that
employees continuously meet the expected high standards set forth in the code of conduct,
any employee handbook delineating or expanding upon these standards of conduct should be
regularly updated as applicable statutes, regulations and Federal health care program
requirements are modified.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a> Medicare+Choice
organizations should<a name="training 2"></a>provide an additional attestation in the
modified standards that stipulates the employee's knowledge of, and commitment to, the
modifications. </p>

<p><a name="b. Specialized Training"><strong>b. Specialized Training</strong> </a></p>

<p>Because Medicare+Choice organizations are responsible for compliance in all of the risk
areas mentioned in section II.A. above, the OIG recommends Medicare+Choice organizations
require individuals who are involved in the risk areas to receive specialized training.
For example, marketing employees should receive training on the marketing, enrollment,
disenrollment and anti-kickback policies. All employees who work with beneficiaries or
providers regarding medical services should receive appropriate training on the risks
associated with under-utilization. Those employees who are involved in developing
enrollment, encounter and ACR data should receive training on HCFA policies in these
areas. Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational
programs are particularly relevant to a Medicare+Choice organization's marketing and
financial personnel, in that the pressure to meet business goals may render these
employees particularly vulnerable to engaging in prohibited practices. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs address the need
for periodic professional education courses for personnel. Such courses would be in
addition to the internal training sessions provided by the organization. For example, the
Medicare+Choice organization should ensure that data submission personnel receive annual
professional training on the updated policies, requirements and directives for the current
year. </p>

<p><a name="c. Format of the Training Program"><strong>c. Format of the Training Program</strong>
</a></p>

<p>The OIG suggests all relevant levels of personnel be made part of various educational
and training programs of the Medicare+Choice organization. Employees should be required to
have a minimum number of educational hours per year, as appropriate, as part of their
employment responsibilities. A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training
and training in several different languages (including the translation of standards of
conducts and other materials), particularly where a Medicare+Choice organization has a
culturally diverse staff, should be implemented so that all affected employees are
knowledgeable about the institution's standards of conduct and procedures for alerting
senior management to problems and concerns. In addition, the materials should be written
at appropriate reading levels for targeted employees. All training materials should be
designed to take into account the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual
trainees. Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and
employee comprehension of the billing company's policies and procedures. </p>

<p><a name="2. Informal and Ongoing Compliance Training"><strong>2. Informal and Ongoing
Compliance Training </strong></a></p>

<p>It is essential that compliance issues remain at the forefront of the Medicare+Choice
organization's priorities. The organization must demonstrate its commitment by continuing
to disseminate the compliance message. One effective mechanism to achieve this goal is to
publish a monthly compliance newsletter. This would allow the Medicare+Choice organization
to address specific examples of problems the company encountered during its ongoing audits
and risk analysis, while reinforcing the company's firm commitment to the general
principles of compliance and ethical conduct. The newsletter could also include the risk
areas identified in current OIG publications or investigations. Finally, the
Medicare+Choice organization could use the newsletter as a mechanism to address areas of
ambiguity in the marketing, utilization review and data submission process, and to notify
employees of significant legal or regulatory developments. The Medicare+Choice
organization should maintain its newsletters in a central location to document the
guidance offered and provide new employees with access to guidance previously provided.
Other written materials, such as posters, fliers or articles in other company
publications, could also be used to disseminate the compliance message. </p>

<p>Another effective method of maintaining the presence of the compliance message is to
maintain a website devoted to compliance issues. This could be linked to the homepage of
the organization. Many organizations have chosen to maintain these sites internally on the
Intranet to alleviate any confidentiality concerns. The Intranet (or Internet) also
facilitates the use of hypertext links that allow the organization to maintain a
centralized source on statutory, regulatory and other program guidance disseminated by
HCFA,<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a> the OIG, the Department of Justice and the
Congress. These links, along with any other webpages that the Medicare+Choice organization
deems pertinent and useful can be assembled on a single site that can, by hypertext link,
provide access to all of these useful resources. </p>

<p><a name="D. DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION"><strong>D. <u>DEVELOPING
EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong> </a></p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and Medicare+Choice
organization personnel, as well as among the organization, health care providers and
enrollees, is critical to the successful implementation of a compliance program and the
reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse and waste. Each organization should have in
place both a mechanism for the reporting of improper conduct, as well a mechanism for more
routine types of communication among the compliance officer and relevant groups. </p>

<p><a name="1. Hotline or Other System for Reports of Potential Misconduct"><strong>1.
Hotline or Other System for Reports of Potential Misconduct</strong> </a></p>

<p>Each Medicare+Choice organization should have in place a hotline or other mechanism<a
href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>through which employees, enrollees or other parties can
report potential violations of the organization's compliance policies or of Federal or
State health care program requirements. In any event, several independent reporting paths
should be created for an employee to report fraud, waste or abuse so that such reports
cannot be diverted by supervisors or other personnel. If the organization establishes a
hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available to all employees, enrollees
and independent contractors, by circulating the number on wallet cards or conspicuously
posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a> <br
wp="br1">
<br>
Matters reported through the hotline or other communication sources that suggest
violations of compliance policies, Federal and State health care program requirements,
regulations or statutes should be documented and investigated promptly to determine their
veracity. A log should be maintained by the compliance officer that records such calls,
including the nature of any investigation and its results.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>
Such information should be included in reports to the governing body, the CEO and
compliance committee. </p>

<p>Employees, enrollees and providers should be permitted to report matters on a
confidential basis. To encourage such reporting, written confidentiality and
non-retaliation policies should be developed and distributed to all employees, enrollees
and providers to encourage communication and the reporting of incidents of potential
fraud.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a> While the Medicare+Choice organization should
always strive to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter's identity, the policies
should explicitly communicate that there may be a point where the individual's identity
may become known or may have to be revealed. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by those who may have
participated in illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex
legal and management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The
compliance officer should work closely with legal counsel to obtain guidance on these
issues. </p>

<p><a name="2. Routine Communication/Access to the Compliance Officer"><strong>2. Routine
Communication/Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> </a></p>

<p>While it is crucial that Medicare+Choice organizations have effective systems in place
for the reporting of suspected misconduct, it is equally important that the compliance
officer foster more routine communication both among its employees and among its health
care providers and enrollees. </p>

<p>With respect to its own employees, the OIG encourages the establishment of procedures
for personnel to seek clarification from the compliance officer or members of the
compliance committee in the event of any confusion or question regarding a company policy,
practice or procedure. Questions and responses should be documented and dated and, if
appropriate, shared with other staff so that standards, policies, practices and procedures
can be updated and improved to reflect any necessary changes or clarifications. The
compliance officer may want to solicit employee input in developing these communication
and reporting systems. The methods discussed above relating to ongoing training and
education are an integral part of this communication.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The communication and coordination function of the compliance program serves an even
more critical role in the context of the managed care environment because the managed care
entity serves as an intermediary between the health care provider and the enrollee.<a
href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a> In fact, the raison d'tre of a managed care
organization is to coordinate the care of its enrollees. As with providers, communications
with beneficiaries and communications with HCFA (and its designees) must demonstrate the
highest level of integrity, honesty and judgment. The Medicare+Choice organization should
implement methods to encourage communication among its enrollees and providers. For
example, a Medicare+Choice organization should communicate the results of audits,
disenrollment surveys, utilization data and quality of care determinations to its
contracting suppliers and providers in order to facilitate open discussion regarding
appropriate health care delivery. </p>

<p><a name="E. AUDITING AND MONITORING"><strong>E. <u>AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong>
</a></p>

<p>An ongoing evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program. The OIG
believes an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of its implementation
and regular reporting to senior company officers.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>
Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring, including reports of suspected
noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance officer and reviewed with the
Medicare+Choice organization's senior management and the compliance committee. The extent
and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors such as the size of the
company, the resources available to the company, the company's prior history of
noncompliance and the risk factors that are prevalent in a particular organization. </p>

<p>Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and
ensure compliance is the performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or
external auditors who have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes,
regulations and Federal health care program requirements. The audits should focus on the
Medicare+Choice organization's programs or divisions, including external relationships
with third-party contractors, specifically those with substantive exposure to Government
enforcement actions. The audits should be sure to cover the range of programmatic
requirements of the Medicare+Choice program. In particular, the audits should focus on the
risk areas identified earlier in this document, especially the data and information which
affects payments by Medicare. Finally, the Medicare+Choice organization should focus on
any areas of specific concern identified within that organization and those that may have
been identified by any outside agency, whether Federal or State. </p>

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer
to identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine
the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for
legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer or manager may want to limit any
corrective action or take no action. If it is determined that the deviation was caused by
improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including fraud and systemic problems, the
Medicare+Choice organization should take prompt steps to correct the problem.<a
href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> Any overpayments discovered as a result of such
deviations should be reported promptly to HCFA (or its designees), with appropriate
documentation and a thorough explanation of the reason for the overpayment.<a
href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at a minimum, annual)
reviews of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>,
whether there has been appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, training,
ongoing educational programs and disciplinary actions.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a>
This process will verify actual conformance by all departments with the compliance
program. Such reviews may support a determination that appropriate records have been
created and maintained to document the implementation of an effective program. </p>

<p>The reviewers involved in any audits should: </p>

<p>o Possess the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential
issues with the subject matter to be reviewed; </p>

<p>o Be independent of line management; </p>

<p>o Have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel and all
relevant areas of operation; </p>

<p>o Present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing
body members of the compliance committee and its provider clients on a regular basis, but
not less than annually; and </p>

<p>o Specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed. </p>

<p>In the Medicare+Choice context, a variety of different methods will be necessary to
adequately monitor and evaluate the ongoing operations of the Medicare+Choice
organization. In general, OIG recommends the use of techniques such as on-site visits,
questionnaires (for providers, enrollees and employees), and trend analyses, to name just
several.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a> Because the auditing and monitoring function
is very different and much more complex in the managed care context than in any other
segment of the health care industry, we have provided additional guidance on the methods
to be used in evaluating selected risk areas. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="1. Marketing/Enrollment/Disenrollment"><strong>1.
Marketing/Enrollment/Disenrollment</strong> </a></p>

<p>Developing a system for evaluating the compliance of the marketing, enrollment and
disenrollment functions of a Medicare+Choice organization requires innovative techniques.
Each Medicare+Choice organization will have to develop an individualized method as to how
to obtain this data. Some of the methods that the OIG suggests include: the use of secret
shoppers; surveying current enrollees;<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a> and conducting
exit interviews with former enrollees (particularly those that disenrolled just prior to
obtaining an expensive service) on their experience with the Medicare+Choice marketing and
enrollment process. Once this data is collected, it must be maintained in a format that
can be accessed readily. </p>

<p>In an effort to integrate the monitoring function with its training function,
Medicare+Choice organizations may wish to test their marketing staff on their knowledge of
the company's policies and procedures, as well as the Federal and State statutes that
govern the marketing process. This assessment can be developed to take on many formats.
Many companies have customized interactive software to test employees' knowledge of
relevant policies and procedures. It may also be formulated in the traditional written
version. </p>

<p>Methods used to monitor marketing agents include the analysis of disenrollment data to
identify marketing agents with high and low percentages of member disenrollments within a
set number of days (<u>e.g.</u>, 90 days). In addition, Medicare+Choice organizations may
want to establish enrollment verification systems requiring that a different individual
from the sales agent meet with beneficiaries who have applied for enrollment to ensure
that they understand restrictions of the plan, such as the lock-in provision. </p>

<p>Finally, it is essential for all marketing materials to be reviewed by the general
counsel's office to ensure that they do not mislead, confuse or misrepresent any aspect of
the plan. Similarly, they should also be examined by the claims processing department and
utilization review office for consistency with the policies, procedures and practices of
these departments. </p>

<p><a name="2. Underutilization and Quality of Care"><strong>2. Underutilization and
Quality of Care</strong> </a></p>

<p>Procedures for tracking and reporting utilization review data are vital to the success
of any compliance endeavor. Medicare+Choice organizations should periodically review the
service areas that are part of the Medicare+Choice organization to ensure that enrollees
are receiving adequate access to care. In reviewing service areas, Medicare+Choice
organizations should collect data on the number of primary care physicians in the service
area, the number and type of specialists in the service area, the waiting time for
appointments, the telephone access to the Medicare+Choice organization and the problems
associated with the coordination of care. All of this data should be maintained in a
database in a format that can be used to generate statistical data and analysis. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should ensure that there are adequate systems in place to
monitor underutilization and inappropriate denials. Such procedures include collecting
data on utilization patterns and detecting aberrant patterns. This data should be checked
against utilization rates in the industry. This function could be performed by a medical
affairs department that is responsible for regular review of claims, the payment system,
encounter data and medical record review to assess the degree to which care is under (or
over) utilized. </p>

<p>Similarly, the Medicare+Choice organization should survey its enrollees on utilization
patterns and whether they felt they were subjected to inadequate health care services or
inappropriate denials. Such survey results should be reviewed and investigated, when
appropriate. Generally, these may be skewed in favor of the Medicare+Choice organization
if the enrollees are current members. Presumably, if an enrollee was truly dissatisfied
with the Medicare+Choice organization's attitude toward enrollee rights, the enrollee
would have disenrolled from the plan. As a result, a Medicare+Choice organization should
evaluate both current enrollee satisfaction surveys and exit interview surveys of former
enrollees. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Medicare+Choice organizations have a good source of information regarding utilization
issues, simply by tracking the type of appeals and grievances they receive from
beneficiaries. This information should be tracked in a database that can be easily
accessed by type of grievance or appeal and results. </p>

<p><a name="3. Data Collection and Submission Processes"><strong>3. Data Collection and
Submission Processes</strong> </a></p>

<p>Given the importance of the enrollment, encounter and ACR data, the Medicare+Choice
organization should develop ways to audit this information to assure its accuracy. For
example, encounter data should be sampled periodically to determine its accuracy and
reliability. As a part of that process, Medicare+Choice organizations must detail in their
contractual relationships with providers the access that they will need to the provider's
medical record documentation. </p>

<p><a name="4. Anti-kickback and Other Inducements"><strong>4. Anti-kickback</strong> <strong>and
Other Inducements</strong> </a></p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should periodically review their contractual documents
and discussions with providers to ensure that &quot;swapping&quot; is not occurring, which
would cause such relationships to fall outside the applicable safe harbor. In addition,
contracts with marketing personnel should be reviewed by legal counsel to be sure they do
not violate applicable statutes and regulations. </p>

<p><a

<u> ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND POLICIES
REGARDING DEALINGS WITH INELIGIBLE PERSONS</u></strong></a> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that all Medicare +Choice organizations' compliance programs include
several key policies in the area of personnel/human resources. The first deals with the
establishment and consistent application of appropriate disciplinary policies to deal with
improper conduct and the second deals with the employment of certain ineligible
individuals. </p>

<p><a name="1. Consistent Enforcement of Disciplinary Policies"><strong>1. Consistent
Enforcement of Disciplinary Policies </strong></a></p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for all employees who have failed to comply with the Medicare+Choice organization's
standards of conduct, policies and procedures, Federal health care program requirements,
or Federal and State laws, or those who have otherwise engaged in wrongdoing. It is vital
to publish and disseminate the range of possible disciplinary actions for improper conduct
and to educate officers and other staff regarding these standards. Employees should be
advised that disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible employee's failure
to detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence or reckless conduct. The
sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension, termination or other sanctions, as
appropriate. While each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine
the appropriate sanction, intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject
transgressors to significant sanctions. </p>

<p>The written standards of conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling
disciplinary problems and identify who will be responsible for taking appropriate action.
For example, while disciplinary actions can be handled by department managers, others may
have to be resolved by a more senior official of the organization. Personnel should be
advised by the organization that disciplinary action will be taken on a fair and equitable
basis, that is, all levels of employees should be subject to similar disciplinary action
for the commission of similar offenses. Managers and supervisors should be held
accountable to implement the disciplinary policy consistently so that the policy will have
the required deterrent effect. </p>

<p><a name="2. Employment of and Contracting With Ineligible Persons"><strong>2.
Employment of and Contracting With Ineligible Persons </strong></a></p>

<p>All Medicare+Choice organizations should use care when delegating substantial
discretionary authority to make decisions that may involve compliance with the law or
compliance oversight. In particular, the organization should ensure that it does not
delegate such responsibilities to individuals or entities that it knows, or should have
known, have a propensity to engage in inappropriate or improper conduct. Pursuant to the
compliance program, Medicare+Choice organization's policies should prohibit the employment
of or contracting with individuals or entities who have been recently convicted of a
criminal offense related to health care or who are listed as debarred, excluded or
otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs. </p>

<p>The policies should require the Medicare+Choice organization to utilize Government
resources to determine whether such individuals or entities are debarred or excluded.
These resources should be used for both potential employees (as part of the employment
application process, which should also include a reasonable and prudent background
investigation), and should be used to periodically check existing employees and
contractors. </p>

<p>Lists of debarred and excluded individuals and entities are currently maintained by
both the OIG and the General Services Administration.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>
By approximately January 2000, the Healthcare Integrity Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) will
be available to Medicare+Choice organizations (for a nominal fee) to use in conducting
these checks on employees and contractors.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> The HIPDB
is an electronic data collection program that will collect, store and disseminate reports
on practitioners, providers and suppliers that have been the subject of health care
related final adverse actions in criminal, civil and administrative proceedings. The final
adverse actions to be reported to the HIPDB include criminal convictions or civil
judgments related to the delivery of health care, actions by Federal or State agencies
responsible for licensing or certification of health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners, and exclusions from Federal or State health care programs. </p>

<p>Pending the resolution of any known criminal charges or proposed debarment or
exclusion, the OIG recommends that such individuals should be removed from direct
responsibility for, or involvement in, any Federal health care program.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>
Similarly, with regard to current employees or independent contractors, if resolution of
the matter results in conviction, debarment or exclusion, then the Medicare+Choice
organization should remove the individual from direct responsibility for, or involvement
with, the organization's business operations related to Federal health care programs. In
addition, they should remove such person from any position for which the person's salary
or other items or services rendered, ordered, or prescribed by the person are paid in
whole or part, directly or indirectly, by Federal health care programs or otherwise with
Federal funds, at least until such time as the person is reinstated into participation in
the Federal health care programs. </p>

<p><a
name="G. RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION INITIATIVES"><strong>G.
<u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION INITIATIVES</u></strong></a>
</p>

<p>Violations of the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance program, failures to comply
with applicable Federal or State law, rules and program instructions and other types of
misconduct threaten a Medicare+Choice organization's status as a reliable, honest and
trustworthy company. Detected but uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the
mission, reputation and legal status of the organization. Consequently, upon reports or
reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance, it is important that the chief
compliance officer or other management officials promptly investigate the conduct in
question to determine whether a material violation of applicable law, rule or program
instruction or the requirements of the compliance program has occurred, and if so, take
steps to correct the problem.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> As appropriate, such
steps may include an immediate referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement
authorities, a corrective action plan, a report to the Government,<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>
and the notification to the provider of any discrepancies or overpayments, if applicable. </p>

<p>The Medicare+Choice organization should document its efforts to comply with applicable
statutes, regulations and Federal health care program requirements. For example, where a
Medicare+Choice organization, in its efforts to comply with a particular statute,
regulation or program requirement, requests advice from a Government agency charged with
administering a Federal health care program, the Medicare+Choice organization should
document and retain a record of the request and any written or oral response. This step is
extremely important if the Medicare+Choice organization intends to rely on that response
to guide it in future decisions, actions or appeals. A log of oral inquiries between the
Medicare+Choice organization and third parties will help the organization document its
attempts at compliance. In addition, the Medicare+Choice organization should maintain
records relevant to the issue of whether its reliance was &quot;reasonable,&quot; and
whether it exercised due diligence in developing procedures to implement the advice. </p>

<p><a name="1. Violations and Investigations"><strong>1. Violations and Investigations</strong>
</a></p>

<p>Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will
probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents. Medicare+Choice
organizations should consider engaging outside counsel, auditors or health care experts to
assist in an investigation. Records of the investigation should contain documentation of
the alleged violation, a description of the investigative process (including the
objectivity of the investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of interview notes
and key documents, a log of the witnesses interviewed and the documents reviewed, the
results of the investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken and any
corrective action implemented. Although any action taken as the result of an investigation
will necessarily vary depending upon the Medicare+Choice organization and the situation,
Medicare+Choice organizations should strive for some consistency by utilizing sound
practices and disciplinary protocols. Further, after a reasonable period, the compliance
officer should review the circumstances that formed the basis for the investigation to
determine whether similar problems have been uncovered or modifications of the compliance
program are necessary to prevent and detect other inappropriate conduct or violations. </p>

<p>If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer
believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of
employees under investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work
activity until the investigation is completed (unless an internal or Government-led
undercover operation known to the Medicare+Choice organization is in effect). In addition,
the compliance officer should take appropriate steps to secure or prevent the destruction
of documents or other evidence relevant to the investigation. If the Medicare+Choice
organization determines disciplinary action is warranted, it should be prompt and imposed
in accordance with the organization's written standards of disciplinary action. </p>

<p><a name="2. Reporting"><strong>2. Reporting</strong> </a></p>

credible evidence of misconduct from any source and, after reasonable inquiry, has reason
to believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil or administrative law,<a

existence of misconduct promptly to the appropriate Government authority<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
within a reasonable period, but not more than 60 days after determining that there is
credible evidence of a violation. Prompt reporting will demonstrate the Medicare+Choice
organization's good faith and willingness to work with governmental authorities to correct
and remedy the problem. In addition, reporting such conduct will be considered a
mitigating factor by the OIG in determining administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>,
penalties, assessments and exclusion), if the reporting company becomes the target of an
OIG investigation.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a> </p>

<p><a name="3. Reporting Procedure"><strong>3. Reporting Procedure</strong> </a></p>

<p>When reporting misconduct to the Government, a Medicare+Choice organization should
provide all evidence relevant to the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State
law(s) and any potential cost impact. The compliance officer, with guidance from the
governmental authorities, could be requested to continue to investigate the reported
violation. Once the investigation is completed, the compliance officer should be required
to notify the appropriate governmental authority of the outcome of the investigation,
including a description of the impact of the alleged violation on the operation of the
applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries. If the investigation ultimately
reveals criminal, civil or administrative violations have occurred, the appropriate
Federal and State officials<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a> shou<a
name="ld be notified immediately."></a>ld be notified immediately. </p>

<p><a name="4. Corrective Actions"><strong>4. Corrective Actions</strong> </a></p>

<p>As previously stated, Medicare+Choice organizations should take appropriate corrective
action, including prompt identification of any overpayment, repayment of the overpayment,
modification to policies or manuals and the imposition of proper disciplinary action, if
applicable. Failure to notify authorities of an overpayment within a reasonable period of
time could be interpreted as an intentional attempt to conceal the overpayment from the
Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation with
respect to the Medicare+Choice organization, as well as any individuals who may have been
involved.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> For this reason, Medicare+Choice
compliance programs should ensure that overpayments are identified quickly and promptly
return overpayments obtained from Medicare or other Federal health care programs.<a

<p align="center"><a name="III. CONCLUSION"><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </a></p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation for the
development of effective and comprehensive Medicare+Choice compliance programs. These
principles can also be used by entities to develop compliance programs applicable to other
Federal and health care programs, as well as for their private lines of business. As
previously stated, however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources
of an individual organization, depending upon its particular corporate structure, mission
and employee composition. The statutes, regulations and guidelines of the Federal and
State health insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private
health plans, should be integrated into every Medicare+Choice organization's compliance
program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry, which reaches millions of
beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly evolving. In no
area of the industry is this more evident than in the growing area of managed care,
particularly Medicare managed care. As a result, the time is right for Medicare+Choice
organizations to implement strong, voluntary compliance programs. Compliance is a dynamic
process that helps to ensure Medicare+Choice organizations are better able to fulfill
their commitment to ethical behavior and to meet the changes and challenges being imposed
upon them by the Congress and private insurers. It is OIG's hope that voluntarily created
compliance programs will enable Medicare+Choice organizations to meet their goals of
providing efficient and quality health care and at the same time, substantially reduce
fraud, waste and abuse. <a name="N_1_"><br wp="br1">

<p>2. A Medicare+Choice organization is defined as a public or private entity
organized and licensed by a State as a risk-bearing entity (with the exception of
provider-sponsored organizations receiving waivers) that is certified by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) as meeting the Medicare+Choice contract requirements. <u>See</u>
42 C.F.R.  422.2. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>

<p>3. For the purposes of this compliance program guidance, a &quot;coordinated care
plan&quot; is a plan that includes a network of providers that are under contract or
arrangement with the organization to deliver the benefit package approved by HCFA. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C.  1395w-28(a)(1); 42 C.F.R.  422.4. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>

<p>4. The regulations require that any plan contracting with HCFA implement a
compliance plan that encompasses the elements detailed in the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.  422.501(b)(vi). HCFA will release an operational
policy letter addressing the compliance requirements detailed in the regulation. In
response to concerns from industry representatives on the short time frame for
implementing a compliance plan, HCFA delayed the actual implementation date of the
compliance plan until January 1, 2000. <a name="N_5_"></a></p>

<p>5. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395w-26(b)(3); 42 C.F.R.  422.402. The Federal
preemption provisions in the Medicare+Choice regulations cover: (1) any State statutes,
regulations, contract requirements, or any other standards that would otherwise apply to
Medicare+Choice organizations only to the extent that such State laws are inconsistent
with the standards under 42 C.F.R. Part 422; and (2) State laws that are specifically
preempted in 42 C.F.R.  422.402(b). <a name="N_6_"></a></p>

<p>6.<sup> </sup>The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an <u>effective</u>
compliance program that pre-dated any Governmental investigation when addressing the
appropriateness of administrative sanctions. However, the burden is on the Medicare+Choice
organization to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of a compliance program.
Further, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729-3733, provides that a person who has
violated the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government within
thirty days of detection, in certain circumstances will be subject to not less than
double, as opposed to treble, damages. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C.  3729(a). In addition, an
organization will receive sentencing credit for an &quot;effective&quot; compliance
program under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing
Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8C2.5. Thus, the ability to react quickly
when violations of the law are discovered may materially reduce the Medicare+Choice
organization's liability. <a name="N_7_"></a></p>

<p>7. <u>See</u> note 4. <a name="N_8_"></a></p>

<p>8. A &quot;Medicare+Choice plan,&quot; as defined in this guidance, refers to
health benefits coverage offered under a policy or contract by a Medicare+Choice
organization that includes a specific set of health benefits offered at a uniform premium
and uniform level of cost sharing to all Medicare beneficiaries residing in the service
area of the Medicare+Choice plan. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.  422.2. <a name="N_9_"></a></p>

legal advice from counsel. <a name="N_13_"></a></p>

<p>13. <u>See</u> note 1. <a name="N_14_"></a></p>

<p>14. Corporate integrity agreements are executed as part of a civil settlement
agreement between the health care provider and the Government to resolve a case based on
allegations of health care fraud or abuse. These OIG-imposed programs are in effect for a
period of three to five years and require many of the elements included in this compliance
guidance. <a name="N_15_"></a></p>

<p>15. Formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of directors, where
applicable. A formal commitment <u>does</u> include the allocation of adequate resources
to ensure that each of the elements is addressed. <a name="N_16_"></a></p>

<p>16. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>,
8A1.2, comment. (n.3(k)). The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and
practices for the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe appropriate sanctions for
offenders convicted of Federal crimes. <a name="N_17_"></a></p>

<p>17. According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization must have
established compliance standards to be followed by its employees and other agents in order
to receive sentencing credit. The Guidelines define &quot;agent&quot; as &quot;any
individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an independent contractor,
authorized to act on behalf of the organization.&quot; <u>See</u> United States Sentencing
Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(d). <a

<p>18. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.  422.502(i). <a name="N_19_"></a></p>

<p>19. At a minimum, the Medicare+Choice organization should send a copy of its
compliance program manual to all of its health care providers. The Medicare+Choice
organization should also coordinate with its health care providers in the development of a
training program, an audit plan and policies for investigating misconduct. <a name="N_20_"></a></p>

<p>20. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.  422.502(i)(3)-(4). <a name="N_21_"></a></p>

<p>21. This includes, but is not limited to, the Medicare+Choice provisions and the
fraud and abuse provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33; the civil
False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729-3733; the criminal false claims statutes, 18 U.S.C.
 287, 1001; the fraud and abuse provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Pub.L. 104-191; and the civil monetary penalties in
the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7a and 42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(g). <u>See also</u>
42 C.F.R.  422.1-422.312. <a name="N_22_"></a></p>

<p>22. &quot;Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an organization has
previously committed casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable steps to prevent such
misconduct&quot; and is a significant factor in the assessment of whether a compliance
program is effective. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines
Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(7)(ii). <a name="N_23_"></a></p>

<p>23. Medicare+Choice organizations should regularly access the HCFA managed care
website for updates on operational policies and procedures. Operational Policy Letters can
be located on HCFA's website at http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mgd-ops.htm. <a name="N_24_"></a></p>

<p>24. Medicare+Choice organizations may also want to consult the OIG's Work Plan when
conducting the risk assessment. The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG
currently intends to address in the fiscal year. It should be noted that the priorities in
the Work Plan are subject to modification and revision as the year progresses and the Work
Plan does not represent a complete or final list of areas of concern to the OIG. The Work
Plan is currently available on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a
name="N_25_"></a></p>

<p>25. Although many of these areas apply specifically to Medicare+Choice
organizations, many of the areas identified below have analogous issues in non-Medicare
organizations. Medicare+Choice organizations that provide private managed care products
should establish additional policies and procedures for risk areas that apply specifically
to those areas. Some overlap with Medicare+Choice policies will likely occur, however
Medicare+Choice organizations should segregate any policies and procedures for which HCFA
has instituted specific reporting requirements for the Medicare population. <a
name="N_26_"></a></p>

<p>26. Medicare+Choice organizations should ensure that they conform to fair marketing
standards as set forth in the statute, the Medicare Managed Care National Marketing Guide
(Marketing Guide)(which can be located on the HCFA Managed Care website at
http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mgd-ops.htm) and all HCFA Operational Policy Letters
affecting marketing matters. <a name="N_27_"></a></p>

election forms unless they are approved by HCFA. 42 C.F.R.  422.80. <a name="N_30_"></a></p>

<p>33. Periodic on-site visits of the Medicare+Choice organization's operations,
bulletins with compliance updates and reminders, distribution of audiotapes or videotapes
on different risk areas, lectures at management and employee meetings, circulation of
recent health care articles covering fraud and abuse and innovative changes to compliance
training are various examples of approaches and techniques the compliance officer can
employ for the purpose of ensuring continued interest in the compliance program and the
Medicare+Choice organization's commitment to its principles and policies. <a name="N_34_"></a></p>

<p>34. It should be noted that Medicare+Choice organizations have ultimate
responsibility for the acts and omissions of its marketing agents. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
422.502(i). <a name="N_35_"></a></p>

<p>35. <u>See</u> Marketing Guide, Chapter IV. <a name="N_36_"></a></p>

<p>36. OIG is also concerned about a similar problem, known as
&quot;gerrymandering,&quot; which is an attempt to eliminate certain high dollar risk
areas from the Medicare+Choice organization's service area. Medicare+Choice organizations
should be sure to have policies in place to prohibit such practices. <a name="N_37_"></a></p>

<p>37. Although the Medicare+Choice program has attempted to alleviate many of the
selective marketing practices through the use of risk adjustment, the phase-in period for
risk-adjustment virtually assures that this will remain a troubling issue at least through
2004. <a name="N_38_"></a></p>

<p>38. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395w-22(b)(1); 42 C.F.R.  422.110. <a name="N_39_"></a></p>

resources to marketing to the Medicare population with disabilities and beneficiaries aged
65 and over. 42 C.F.R.  422.80(e)(2)(i). <a name="N_43_"></a></p>

<p>43. The statute prohibits the provision of cash or other monetary rebates as an
inducement for enrollment in the plan. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395w-21(h)(4)(A). However,
HCFA allows Medicare+Choice organizations to give Medicare beneficiaries nominal value
gifts, provided that the plan offers these gifts whether or not the beneficiary enrolls in
the plan. HCFA defines nominal value as an item having little or no resale value
(generally, less than $10), which cannot be readily converted into cash. <u>See</u>
Marketing Guide, Chapter II. The use of inducements is also discussed in Section II.B.2.f.

<p>60. On a related topic, Medicare+Choice organizations should also be sure that
their computer systems are Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant. A May 1999 OIG report indicates that
based on a survey of Medicare managed care organizations, only 22 percent were Y2K ready,
with two-thirds of the remainder reporting that they will be ready by December 31, 1999.
The majority of the respondents were unaware of the Y2K readiness of their subcontractors.

$25,000 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b. In
addition, a CMP can be imposed for the misrepresentation or falsification of information

<p>67. 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(b). If it is determined that a party has violated the
anti-kickback statute, the individual or entity can be excluded from participation in the
Medicare and other Federal health care programs (as defined in 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(f)).
42 U.S.C.  1320a-7(b)(7). In addition, there is an administrative CMP provision for
violating the anti-kickback statute. 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7a(a)(7). <a name="N_68_"></a></p>

<p>68. This safe harbor was developed in accordance with section 216 of HIPAA and
section 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 (Pub.
L. 100-93) through a negotiated rulemaking process that began in the spring of 1997. For a
more detailed description of the negotiated rulemaking, <u>see</u> the Committee Statement

which can be found on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a name="N_69_"></a></p>

<p>69. In addition, arrangements between direct contractors and all subcontractors or
successive tiers of subcontractors are protected, as long as the arrangement is for the
provision of health care items or services that are covered by the arrangement between the
direct contractor and the managed care organization and the arrangement meets the
requirements applicable to arrangements between the direct contractor and the managed care
organization. <a name="N_70_"></a></p>

<p>70. Our concerns regarding the use of inducements in a manner that leads to
enrollment of only healthy beneficiaries, such as offering memberships to exercise clubs

<p>71. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395dd. A separate provision prohibits Medicare+Choice
organizations requiring enrollees to obtain prior authorization for emergency services. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C.  1395w-22(d)(1)(E). <a name="N_72_"></a></p>

<p>72. OIG and HCFA have issued a proposed Special Advisory Bulletin on this topic. <u>See</u>
63 Fed. Reg. 67,486 (12/7/98). <a name="N_73_"></a></p>

<p>73. This should include notifications regarding: quality of care issues; confusing
or inaccurate encounter data; and termination of the contract. <a name="N_74_"></a></p>

<p>74. The OIG believes that it is not advisable for the compliance function to be
subordinate to the Medicare+Choice organization's general counsel, comptroller or similar
company financial officer. Free-standing compliance functions help to ensure independent
legal reviews and financial analyses of the institution's compliance activities. By
separating the compliance function from the key management positions of general counsel or
CFO (where the size and structure of the organization make this a feasible option), a
system of checks and balances is established to more effectively achieve the compliance
program's goals. <a name="N_75_"></a></p>

<p>75. For multi-site Medicare+Choice organizations, the OIG encourages coordination
with each facility owned by the Medicare+Choice organization through the use of compliance
liaisons at each site. <a name="N_76_"></a></p>

<p>76. <u>See</u> note 94. <a name="N_77_"></a></p>

<p>77. The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals
with varying responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, finance, audit,
human resources, utilization review, medicine, claims processing, information systems,
legal, marketing, enrollment and disenrollment as well as employees and managers of key
operating units. These individuals should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive
experience within their respective departments to implement any necessary changes in the
company's policies and procedures. <a name="N_78_"></a></p>

<p>78. A Medicare+Choice organization should expect its compliance committee members
and compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness and an
approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the
organization. The compliance committee members should also have significant professional
experience in working with quality assurance, enrollment, marketing, clinical records and
auditing principles. <a name="N_79_"></a></p>

<p>79. While the OIG recognizes that not all standards, policies and procedures need
to be communicated to all employees, it believes that the bulk of the standards that
relate to complying with fraud and abuse laws and other ethical areas should be addressed
and made part of all employees' training. <a name="N_80_"></a></p>

<p>81. The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a small
Medicare+Choice organization to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls
solely on compliance issues. These companies may explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>,
contracting with an independent source to provide hotline services or establishing a
written method of confidential disclosure. <a name="N_82_"></a></p>

<p>82. Medicare+Choice organizations should also post in a prominent, available area
the HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800- HHS-TIPS), in addition to any
organization's hotline number that may be posted. <a name="N_83_"></a></p>

<p>83. To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the Medicare+Choice
organization should create an intake form for all compliance issues identified through
reporting mechanisms. The form could include information concerning the date the potential
problem was reported, the internal investigative methods utilized, the results of any
investigation, any corrective action implemented, any disciplinary measures imposed and
any overpayments and monies returned. <a name="N_84_"></a></p>

<p>84. The OIG believes that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation, a
concept embodied in the provisions of the False Claims Act. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 
3730(h). In many cases, employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u>
<u>tam</u> provisions out of frustration because of the company's failure to take action
when a questionable, fraudulent or abusive situation was brought to the attention of
senior corporate officials. <a name="N_85_"></a></p>

<p>85. In addition to methods of communication used by current employees, an effective
employee exit interview program could be designed to solicit information from departing
employees regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations of the Medicare+Choice
organization's policy and procedures. <a name="N_86_"></a></p>

<p>86. An &quot;enrollee&quot; is defined in this compliance program guidance as any
Medicare+Choice eligible individual who has elected a Medicare+Choice plan offered by a
Medicare+Choice organizations. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.  422.2. <a name="N_87_"></a></p>

<p>87. Even when a facility is owned by a larger corporate entity, the regular
auditing and monitoring of the compliance activities of an individual facility must be a
key feature in any annual review. Appropriate reports on audit findings should be
periodically provided and explained to a parent-organization's senior staff and officers. <a
name="N_88_"></a></p>

<p>88. The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a
Medicare+Choice organization, the compliance officer, with the assistance of department
managers, take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the organization's operations from a compliance
perspective. This assessment can be undertaken by outside consultants, law or accounting
firms, or internal staff, with authoritative knowledge of health care compliance
requirements. This &quot;snapshot,&quot; often used as part of bench marking analysis,
becomes a baseline for the compliance officer and other managers to judge the
Medicare+Choice organization's progress in reducing or eliminating potential areas of
vulnerability. Medicare+Choice organizations should track statistical data on utilization
review and quality data based on customer satisfaction and renewal data. This will
facilitate identification of problem areas and elimination of potential areas of abusive
or fraudulent conduct. <a name="N_89_"></a></p>

<p>89. Prompt steps to correct the problem include contacting the appropriate provider
in situations where the provider's actions contributed to the problem. <a name="N_90_"></a></p>

<p>90. In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section G.2, below, reports of
fraud or systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate governmental authority. <a
name="N_91_"></a></p>

<p>91. One way to assess the knowledge, awareness and perceptions of the
Medicare+Choice organization's staff is through the use of a validated survey instrument (<u>e.g.</u>,
employee questionnaires, interviews or focus groups). <a name="N_92_"></a></p>

<p>92. Medicare+Choice organizations may want to consult HCFA's Contractor Performance
Monitoring System Manual to get additional ideas for monitoring methods. In addition,
organizations may want to consult the OAS website for information on conducting audits,
including information on statistical sampling (RAT-STATS). <u>See</u> note 10. <a
name="N_93_"></a></p>

<p>93. It should be noted, while this method may be less expensive, it may not provide
unbiased data, particularly in the area of selective marketing. In fact, in the selective
marketing area, the data may be skewed significantly in favor of the Medicare+Choice
organization. <a name="N_94_"></a></p>

<p>94. OIG's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities is available on the Internet at
http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig and the General Services Administration list of debarred
contractors is available on the Internet at http://epls.arnet.gov/. <a name="N_95_"></a></p>

<p>95. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7e. <a name="N_96_"></a></p>

<p>96. Prospective employees who have been officially reinstated into the Medicare and
Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof of such
reinstatement. <a name="N_97_"></a></p>

<p>97. Instances of non-compliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
existence, or amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely
determinative of whether or not the conduct should be investigated and reported to
Governmental authorities. In fact, there may be instances where there is no readily
identifiable monetary loss at all, but corrective action and reporting are still necessary
to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries. <a name="N_98_"></a></p>

<p>98. The OIG currently maintains a provider self-disclosure protocol that encourages
providers to report suspected fraud. The concept of self-disclosure is premised on a
recognition that the Government alone cannot protect the integrity of the Medicare and
other Federal health care programs. Health care providers must be willing to police
themselves, correct underlying problems and work with the Government to resolve these
matters. The self-disclosure protocol can be located on the OIG's website at
http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a name="N_99_"></a></p>

<p>99. When making the determination of credible misconduct, the Medicare+Choice
organization should consider, among other statutes, 18 U.S.C.  669 [holding an
individual(s) criminally liable for knowingly and willfully embezzling, stealing or
otherwise converting to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or
intentionally misapplying any of the monies, funds . . . premiums, credits, property or
assets of a health care benefit program] and 18 U.S.C.  2 [establishing criminal
liability for an individual(s) who commits an offense against the United States or aids,
abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission as punishable as the
principle]. In making this determination, the Medicare+Choice organization should also
consider the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729, which imposes treble damages and
penalties on those (including subcontractors) who knowingly submit false claims for
federal funds, or cause their submission, or who knowingly prepare false records or
statements to get such false claims paid. Under the civil False Claims Act,
&quot;knowingly&quot; means that a person &quot;has actual knowledge of the information,
acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information, or acts in
reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and no proof of specific
intent to defraud is required.&quot; 31 U.S.C.  3729. <a name="N_100_"></a></p>

<p>100. Appropriate Federal and/or State authorities include the Office of Inspector
General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Criminal and Civil Divisions
of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorneys in the relevant districts, and the other
investigative arms for agencies administering the affected Federal or State health care
programs, such as the State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of Inspector
General, U.S. Department of Labor (which has primary criminal jurisdiction over FECA,
Black Lung and Longshore programs) and the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (which has primary jurisdiction over the Federal Employees Health
Benefit Program). <a name="N_101_"></a></p>

<p>101. The OIG has published criteria setting forth those factors that the OIG takes
into consideration in determining whether it is appropriate to exclude a health care
provider from program participation pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7(b)(7) for violations
of various fraud and abuse laws. <u>See</u> 62 Fed. Reg. 67,392 (12/24/97). <a
name="N_102_"></a></p>

<p>102. <u>See</u> note 100. <a name="N_103_"></a></p>

<p>103. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(a)(3). <a name="N_104_"></a></p>

<p>104. If a Medicare+Choice organization needs further guidance regarding normal 
  repayment channels, the organization should consult with the CHPP. CHPP may 
  require certain information (<u>e.g.,</u> alleged violation or issue causing 
  overpayment, description of overpayment, description of the internal investigative 
  process with methodologies used to determine any overpayments, disciplinary 
  actions taken and corrective actions taken) to be submitted with return of any 
  overpayments, and that such repayment information be submitted to a specific 
  department or individual in the carrier or intermediary's organization. Interest 
  will be assessed, when appropriate. &nbsp;<u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 405.376. </p>
