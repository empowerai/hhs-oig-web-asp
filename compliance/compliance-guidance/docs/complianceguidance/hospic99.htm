<p align="center"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>

<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) continues to promote voluntarily developed and implemented compliance programs for
the health care industry. The following compliance program guidance is intended to assist
hospices<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>and their agents and subproviders (referred to
collectively in this document as &quot;hospices&quot;) develop effective internal controls
that promote adherence to applicable Federal and State law, and the program requirements
of Federal, State, and private health plans. The adoption and implementation of voluntary
compliance programs significantly advance the prevention of fraud, abuse and waste in
these health care plans while at the same time further the fundamental mission of all
hospices, which is to provide palliative care<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to
patients. </p>

<p>Within this document, the OIG first provides its general views on the value and
fundamental principles of hospice compliance programs, and then provides the specific
elements that each hospice should consider when developing and implementing an effective
compliance program. While this document presents basic procedural and structural guidance
for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself a compliance program. Rather, it
is a set of guidelines to be considered by a hospice interested in implementing a
compliance program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes the size-differential that exists between operations of the
different hospices and organizations that compose the hospice industry. Appropriately,
this guidance is pertinent for all hospices, whether for-profit, non-profit,
provider-based, independent, community-based, volunteer-based, large, small, urban or
rural. The applicability of the recommendations and guidelines provided in this document
depends on the circumstances of each particular hospice. However, regardless of a
hospice's size and structure, the OIG believes that every hospice can and should strive to
accomplish the objectives and principles underlying all of the compliance policies and
procedures recommended within this guidance. </p>

<p>Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within a hospice
that promotes prevention, detection, and resolution of instances of conduct that do not
conform to Federal and State law, and Federal, State and private payor health care program
requirements, as well as the hospice's business policies. In practice, the compliance
program should effectively articulate and demonstrate the organization's commitment to
ethical conduct. Compliance programs guide a hospice's governing body (<u>e.g.</u>, board
of directors or trustees), chief executive officer (CEO), managers, physicians,
clinicians, billing personnel, and other employees in the efficient management and
operation of a hospice. Eventually, a compliance program should become part of the fabric
of routine hospice operations. </p>

<p>It is incumbent upon a hospice's corporate officers and managers to provide ethical
leadership to the organization and to assure that adequate systems are in place to
facilitate ethical and legal conduct. Employees, managers and the Government will focus on
the words and actions of a hospice's leadership as a measure of the organization's
commitment to compliance. Indeed, many hospices have adopted mission statements
articulating their commitment to high ethical standards. A formal compliance program, as
an additional element in this process, offers a hospice a further concrete method that may
improve the appropriateness and quality of care and reduce waste. Compliance programs also
provide a central coordinating mechanism for furnishing and disseminating information and
guidance on applicable Federal and State statutes, regulations and other requirements. </p>

<p>Implementing an effective compliance program requires a substantial commitment of time,
energy and resources by senior management and the hospice's governing body.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
Superficial programs that simply purport to comply with the elements discussed and
described in this guidance or programs that are hastily constructed and implemented
without appropriate ongoing monitoring will likely be ineffective and could expose the
hospice to greater liability than no program at all. While it may require significant
additional resources or reallocation of existing resources to implement an effective
compliance program, the OIG believes that the long term benefits of implementing the
program outweigh the costs.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes an effective compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the
public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse,
strengthening operational quality, improving the quality of health care services and
reducing the cost of health care. Attaining these goals provides positive results to
hospices, the Government, and individual citizens alike. In addition to fulfilling its
legal duty to ensure that it is not submitting false or inaccurate claims to Government
and private payors, a hospice may gain numerous additional benefits by voluntarily
implementing an effective compliance program. These benefits may include the ability to: 

<ul>
  <li>formulate effective controls to assure compliance with Federal and State statutes, rules
    and regulations, and Federal, State and private payor health care program requirements and
    internal guidelines;</li>
  <li>concretely demonstrate to employees and the community at large the hospice's strong
    commitment to honest and responsible provider and corporate conduct;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>identify and prevent illegal and unethical conduct; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>improve internal communication;</li>
  <li>more quickly and accurately react to employees' operational compliance concerns and
    target resources to address those concerns;</li>
  <li>improve the quality, efficiency, and consistency of patient care;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>create a centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes,
    regulations, and other program directives regarding fraud, waste and abuse, and related
    issues; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>formulate a methodology that encourages employees to report potential problems;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>develop procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of alleged misconduct
    by corporate officers, managers, employees, independent contractors, consultants,
    volunteers, physicians, nurses and other health care professionals; </li>
  <li>initiate immediate, appropriate, and decisive corrective action; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>minimize, through early detection and reporting, the loss to the Government from false
    claims, and thereby reduce the hospice's exposure to civil damages and penalties, criminal
    sanctions and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is a sound investment on
the part of a hospice. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the implementation of a compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud, abuse and waste from the hospice system. However, a sincere effort by
hospices to comply with applicable Federal and State standards, as well as the
requirements of private health care programs, through the establishment of an effective
compliance program, significantly reduces the risk of unlawful or improper conduct. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</u></strong> </p>

<p>Given the diversity within the industry, there is no single &quot;best&quot; hospice
compliance program. The OIG understands the variances and complexities within the hospice
industry and is sensitive to the differences among large national and regional
multi-hospice organizations, small independent hospices and other types of hospice
organizations and systems. However, elements of this guidance can be used by all hospices,
regardless of size, location, or corporate structure, to establish an effective compliance
program. Similarly, a hospital or corporation that owns a hospice or provides hospice
services may incorporate these elements into its system-wide compliance or managerial
structure. We recognize that some hospices may not be able to adopt certain elements to
the same comprehensive degree that others with more extensive resources may achieve. This
guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how a hospice can best establish internal
controls and monitoring to correct and prevent fraudulent activities. By no means should
the contents of this guidance be viewed as an exclusive discussion of the advisable
elements of a compliance program. On the contrary, the OIG strongly encourages a hospice
to develop and implement compliance elements that uniquely address its own particular risk
areas. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that input and support by the individuals and organizations that will
use the tools set forth in this document are critical to the development and success of
this compliance program guidance. In a continuing effort to collaborate closely with the
private sector, the OIG placed a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> soliciting
recommendations and suggestions on what should be included in this Compliance Program
Guidance, and then published draft Compliance Program Guidance for Hospices in the Federal
Register for public comment.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Further, we took into
consideration previous OIG publications, such as Special Fraud Alerts, the recent findings
and recommendations in reports issued by OIG's Office of Audit Services and Office of
Evaluation and Inspections, as well as the experience of past and recent fraud
investigations related to hospices conducted by OIG's Office of Investigations and the
Department of Justice. As appropriate, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more
information and knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the law, rules,
policies and procedures of the Federal, State and private health plans occur. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the development and implementation of compliance programs in
hospices often raise sensitive and complex legal and managerial issues.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is critical guidance for providers who
are sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant health care statutes and regulations.
</p>

<p align="center"><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong> </p>

<p>The elements proposed by these guidelines are similar to those of other compliance
program guidances<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> and the OIG's corporate integrity
agreements.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> The elements represent a guide that can be
tailored to fit the needs and financial realities of a particular hospice. The OIG is
cognizant that, with regard to compliance programs, one model is not suitable to every
hospice. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that every effective compliance program must begin with a formal
commitment<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> by the hospice's governing body to include <u>all</u>
of the applicable elements listed below. These elements are based on the seven steps of
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>Further, we believe
that every hospice can implement most of our recommended elements that expand upon these
seven steps. We recognize that full implementation of all elements may not be immediately
feasible for all hospices. However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful
commitment on the part of the hospice administration, especially the governing body and
the CEO, will substantially contribute to a program's successful implementation. As the
compliance program is implemented, that commitment should cascade down through the
management of the hospice to every employee at all levels in the organization. </p>

<p>At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include the following seven
elements: </p>

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as
written policies and procedures, which promote the hospice's commitment to compliance and
address specific areas of potential fraud, such as assessment of Medicare eligibility,
quality assurance and financial relationships with nursing facilities and other health
care professionals and entities; </p>

<p>(2) The designation of a compliance officer and other appropriate bodies, <u>e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee, charged with the responsibility for operating and
monitoring the compliance program, and who report directly to the CEO and the governing
body;<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training
programs for all affected employees; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(4) The creation and maintenance of a process, such as a hotline or other reporting
system, to receive complaints and ensure effective lines of communication between the
compliance officer and all employees, and the adoption of procedures to protect the
anonymity of complainants and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation; </p>

<p>(5) The use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance,
identify problem areas, and assist in the reduction of identified problem areas; </p>

<p>(6) The development of appropriate disciplinary mechanisms to enforce standards and the
development of policies to address (i) employees who have violated internal compliance
policies, applicable statutes, regulations or Federal health care program requirements<a
href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> and (ii) the employment of sanctioned and other
specified individuals; and </p>

<p>(7) The development of policies that direct prompt and proper responses to detected
offenses, including the initiation of appropriate corrective action and preventative
measures. </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</u></strong> </p>

<p>Every compliance program should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies, standards, and practices that identify specific areas of risk and
vulnerability to the hospice. These policies, standards and practices should be developed
under the direction and supervision of, or subject to review by, the compliance officer
and compliance committee and, at a minimum, should be provided to all individuals who are
affected by the particular policy at issue, including the hospice's agents and independent
contractors.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>1. Standards of Conduct</strong> </p>

<p>Hospices should develop standards of conduct for all affected employees that include a
clearly delineated commitment to compliance by the hospice's senior management<a
href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> and its divisions, including affiliated providers
operating under the hospice's control and other health care professionals (<u>e.g.</u>,
hospice physicians,<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> nurses, physical therapists,
occupational therapists, social workers, spiritual counselors, bereavement counselors and
volunteers). Standards should articulate the hospice's commitment to comply with all
Federal, State and private insurer standards, with an emphasis on preventing fraud and
abuse. They should explicitly state the organization's mission, goals and ethical
requirements of compliance and reflect a carefully crafted, clear expression of
expectations for all hospice governing body members, officers, managers, employees,
physicians, clinicians and, where appropriate, volunteers, contractors and other agents.
These standards should promote integrity, support objectivity, and foster trust. Standards
should not only address compliance with statutes and regulations, but should also set
forth broad principles that guide employees in conducting business professionally and
properly. </p>

<p>The standards should be distributed to, and comprehensible by, all affected employees (<u>e.g.</u>,
translated into other languages when necessary and written at appropriate reading levels).
Further, to assist in ensuring that employees continuously meet the expected high
standards set forth in the code of conduct, any employee handbook delineating or expanding
upon these standards of conduct should be regularly updated as applicable statutes,
regulations and Federal health care program requirements are modified and/or clarified.<a
href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> </p>

<p>When they first begin working for the hospice, and each time new standards of conduct
are issued, employees should be asked to sign a statement certifying that they have
received, read, and understood the standards of conduct. An employee's certification
should be retained by the hospice in the employee's personnel file, and available for
review by the compliance officer. </p>

<p><strong>2. Risk Areas</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes that a hospice's written policies and procedures should take into
consideration the particular statutes, rules, and program instructions that apply to each
function or department of the hospice.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> In contrast to
the standards of conduct, which are designed to be a clear and concise collection of
fundamental standards, the written policies should articulate specific procedures that
hospice staff should follow. </p>

<p>Consequently, we recommend that these policies and procedures be coordinated with the
appropriate training and educational programs, with an emphasis on areas of special
concern that have been identified by the OIG through its investigative and audit
functions.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> Although the OIG concluded in a 1998 report
that the Medicare hospice program seems to be working as intended,<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
compliance programs for hospices should still address areas of OIG concern that include:<a
href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> 

<ul>
  <li>uninformed consent to elect the Medicare Hospice Benefit;<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a></li>
  <li>admitting patients to hospice care who are not terminally ill;<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></li>
  <li>arrangement with another health care provider who a hospice knows is submitting claims
    for services already covered by the Medicare Hospice Benefit;<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a></li>
  <li>under-utilization;<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a></li>
  <li>falsified medical records or plans of care;<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a></li>
  <li>untimely and/or forged physician certifications on plans of care;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>inadequate or incomplete services rendered by the Interdisciplinary Group;<a
    href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a></li>
  <li>insufficient oversight of patients, in particular, those patients receiving more than
    six consecutive months of hospice care;<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a></li>
  <li>hospice incentives to actual or potential referral sources (<u>e.g.</u>, physicians,
    nursing homes, hospitals, patients, etc.) that may violate the anti-kickback statute or
    other similar Federal or State statute or regulation,<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
    including improper arrangements with nursing homes;<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a></li>
  <li>overlap in the services that a nursing home provides, which results in insufficient care
    provided by a hospice to a nursing home resident;<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a></li>
  <li>improper relinquishment of core services and professional management responsibilities to
    nursing homes, volunteers and privately-paid professionals;<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a></li>
  <li>providing hospice services in a nursing home before a written agreement has been
    finalized, if required;<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>billing for a higher level of care than was necessary;<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>knowingly billing for inadequate or substandard care;</li>
  <li>pressure on a patient to revoke the Medicare Hospice Benefit when the patient is still
    eligible for and desires care, but the care has become too expensive for the hospice to
    deliver;<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></li>
  <li>billing for hospice care provided by unqualified or unlicensed clinical personnel;<a
    href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a></li>
  <li>false dating of amendments to medical records;<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a></li>
  <li>high-pressure marketing of hospice care to ineligible beneficiaries;<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a></li>
  <li>improper patient solicitation activities, such as &quot;patient charting;&quot;<a
    href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> </li>
  <li>inadequate management and oversight of subcontracted services, which results in improper
    billing;<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a></li>
  <li>sales commissions based upon length of stay in hospice;<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a></li>
  <li>deficient coordination of volunteers;<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a></li>
  <li>improper indication of the location where hospice services were delivered;<a
    href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a></li>
  <li>failure to comply with applicable requirements for verbal orders for hospice services;<a
    href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a></li>
  <li>non-response to late hospice referrals by physicians;<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>knowing misuse of provider certification numbers, which results in improper billing;<a
    href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>failure to adhere to hospice licensing requirements and Medicare conditions of
    participation;<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>knowing failure to return overpayments made by Federal health care programs.<a
    href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>A hospice's prior history of noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations and
Federal health care program requirements may indicate additional types of risk areas where
the hospice may be vulnerable and that may require policies and procedures to prevent
recurrence.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>Additional risk areas should be assessed by
hospices as well and incorporated into the written policies and procedures and training
elements developed as part of their compliance programs. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><strong>3. Eligibility Requirements</strong> </p>

<p>Of the risk areas identified above, those pertaining to the Medicare eligibility
requirements have been the frequent subject of investigations and audits. With respect to
the reimbursement process, a hospice's written policies and procedures should reflect and
reinforce current Federal health care requirements regarding the eligibility for Medicare
reimbursement. The policies must create a mechanism for the billing or reimbursement staff
to communicate effectively and accurately with the clinical staff. Policies and procedures
should: 

<ul>
  <li>provide for complete and timely documentation of the specific clinical factors that
    qualify a patient for the Medicare Hospice Benefit;<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a></li>
  <li>delineate who has authority to make entries in the patient record;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>emphasize that patients should be admitted to hospice care only when appropriate
    documentation supports the applicable reimbursement eligibility criteria and only when
    such documentation is maintained, appropriately organized in a legible form, and available
    for audit and review. The documentation should record the activity leading to the record
    entry and the identity of the individual providing the service. Documentation should be
    consistent and any discrepancies discussed and reconciled. The hospice should consult with
    its physicians, clinical staff and/or governing body to establish other appropriate
    documentation guidelines;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>indicate that the diagnosis and procedure codes for hospice services reported on the
    reimbursement claim should be based on the patient's clinical condition as reflected in
    the medical record and other documentation, and should comply with all applicable official
    coding rules and guidelines. Any Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure
    Coding System (HCPCS), International Classification of Disease (ICD), or revenue code (or
    successor codes) used by the billing staff should accurately describe the service that was
    ordered by the physician and performed by the hospice. The documentation necessary for
    accurate billing should be available to billing staff; and</li>
  <li>provide that the compensation for hospice admission personnel, billing department
    personnel and billing consultants should not offer any financial incentive to bill for
    hospice care regardless of whether applicable eligibility criteria for reimbursement is
    met.</li>
</ul>

<p>The written policies and procedures concerning proper billing should reflect the
current reimbursement principles set forth in applicable regulations and should be
developed in tandem with private payor and organizational standards. Particular attention
should be paid to issues associated with patient election of the Medicare Hospice Benefit,
certification of terminal illness of a patient, development and certification of a
patient's interdisciplinary plan of care and reasonableness and necessity of the level of
hospice care provided.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>a. Terminal Illness as an Eligibility Requirement</strong> </p>

<p>For a hospice patient to receive reimbursement for hospice services under Medicare,<a
href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> the patient must be &quot;terminally ill.&quot;<a
href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a> Hospices should create oversight mechanisms to ensure
that the terminal illness of a Medicare beneficiary is verified<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
and the specific factors qualifying the patient as terminally ill are properly documented.<a
href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> Any determinative assessment of the terminal illness of
a Medicare beneficiary should be completed prior to billing Medicare for hospice care.
Physicians must certify that the beneficiary was terminally ill at the time when a patient
was admitted for hospice services as well as at the beginning of subsequent hospice
benefit periods.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The hospice's written policies and procedures should require, at a minimum, that: 

<ul>
  <li>before a patient is admitted for hospice services, the hospice physician and attending
    physician thoroughly review and certify the admitting diagnosis and prognosis;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>a patient's medical record contain complete documentation to support the certification
    made by the hospice physician or attending physician;<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a></li>
  <li>the patient or lawful representative is informed of the determination of the patient's
    life limiting condition;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the patient or lawful representative is aware that the goal of hospice is directed
    toward relief of symptoms, rather than the cure of the underlying disease;</li>
  <li>a patient's medical condition and status is sufficiently reviewed during
    Interdisciplinary Group meetings; and</li>
  <li>the clinical progression/status of a patient's disease and medical condition are
    properly documented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hospices can further ensure compliance with the terminal illness requirement through
discussions with Medicare beneficiaries and their families, reminding them that they must
satisfy the regulatory requirements for terminal illness status to be eligible for
Medicare coverage. These discussions can take place at the beginning of hospice election
and during appropriate times throughout a patient's hospice care, <u>e.g.</u>, at time of
recertification. Because the Medicare conditions of participation require hospices to give
all beneficiaries an informed consent form that outlines their legal rights before
furnishing them with hospice care,<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> providers can
include reminders of terminal illness requirements in these forms. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that decisions to admit patients to hospices are often not based on
medical factors alone. Such decisions are routinely influenced by non-medical factors that
would generally be reflected in the plan of care. However, it is important to make a
distinction between admitting a patient to a hospice program and certifying a patient for
the Medicare Hospice Benefit. Based on an individual hospice's admission criteria, some
patients may be admitted to hospice care prior to an estimated six months before death, as
long as the hospice is paid fair market value for its services. Regardless, patients can
be certified for the Medicare Hospice Benefit <u>only</u> when it is reasonable to
conclude that a patient's life expectancy is six months or less if the illness runs its
normal course. In other cases, alternative modes of reimbursement, often provided through
community support, should be sought outside the Medicare Hospice Benefit. </p>

<p><strong>b. Plan of Care</strong> </p>

<p>A hospice should take all reasonable steps to ensure that a written plan of care is
established and maintained for each individual who receives hospice services, and that the
care provided to that individual is in accordance with the plan.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
The plan must be established by the patient's attending physician, the hospice physician,
and the Interdisciplinary Group.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a> Each patient's needs
should be continuously assessed and all treatment options explored and evaluated in the
context of the patient's symptoms.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a> The hospice's
written policies and procedures should require, at a minimum, that: 

<ul>
  <li>before the hospice bills for hospice care provided to a patient, the plan of care must
    be established by the hospice physician and the Interdisciplinary Group;<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a></li>
  <li>the plan of care includes: (i) an assessment of the hospice patient's needs and
    identification of services, including the management of discomfort and symptom relief, and
    (ii) the scope and frequency of services, in detail, needed to meet the patient's and
    family's needs;<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a></li>
  <li>the plan of care must be reviewed and updated, at intervals specified in the plan, by
    the attending physician, hospice physician and the Interdisciplinary Group;<a
    href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the hospice properly documents any review or update of a hospice patient's plan of care
    by the attending physician, the hospice physician and Interdisciplinary Group; and <a
    href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the hospice regularly reviews the appropriateness of Interdisciplinary Group services
    and level of services being provided, patient admission to hospice, patient length of stay
    delays and specific treatment modalities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c. Utilization of Hospice Services</strong> </p>

<p>A hospice is accountable for the appropriate allocation and utilization of its
resources in order to provide optimal care consistent with patient and family needs.<a
href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> Accordingly, a hospice should monitor and evaluate its
resource allocation regularly to identify and resolve problems with the utilization of
services, facilities and personnel. To achieve such monitoring, a hospice should schedule
Interdisciplinary Group case reviews and conferences,<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>
review specific problems that may arise with services provided and use objective written
criteria or treatment protocols to guide decisions about the utilization of hospice
services provided. Utilization concerns may be an indication of a problem with the quality
or quantity of services provided to a hospice patient or demonstrate a more fundamental
concern as to the patient's eligibility for the Medicare Hospice Benefit in the first
place. Therefore, a hospice should implement policies and procedures to identify, assess
and rectify any problems associated with: 

<ul>
  <li>appropriateness of Interdisciplinary Group services and level of services being
    provided;</li>
  <li>appropriateness of patient admission to hospice;</li>
  <li>regular review of patient length of stay;</li>
  <li>delays in admission or in the provision of Interdisciplinary Group services; and</li>
  <li>specific treatment modalities.</li>
</ul>

<p>When utilization problems are identified, a hospice should implement corrective actions
and preventative measures that may include ongoing monitoring, changes in the provision of
services and revisions of policies and procedures. </p>

<p><strong>d. Levels of Hospice Care</strong> </p>

<p>A hospice's compliance program should provide that it should only seek reimbursement
for services that the hospice has reason to believe are reasonable and necessary<a
href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> for the palliation or management of terminal illness and
were ordered by a physician or other appropriately licensed individual. The OIG recommends
the hospice's compliance program communicate to physicians authorized to certify patients
for hospice care and hospice personnel authorized to admit patients for hospice care that
services will only be paid if ordered, certified, covered, reasonable and necessary for
the patient, given his or her clinical condition. </p>

<p>Although hospice services are reimbursed on a per diem basis and not per individual
component of the services performed, the payment is based upon the level of care provided.<a
href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a> Because HCFA establishes different payment amounts for
specific categories of covered hospice care, a hospice must ensure that it provides for
services to hospice patients that are reasonable and necessary. Otherwise, the hospice may
be reimbursed for a higher level of services than was necessary, <u>e.g.</u>, a hospice
that provides and bills for continuous care where only routine home care is necessary. </p>

<p>As a preliminary matter, the OIG recognizes that licensed health care professionals
must be able to order any services that are appropriate for the care of their patients.
However, Medicare and other Government and private health care plans will only pay for
those services otherwise covered that meet appropriate standards (<u>i.e.</u>, in the case
of Medicare, &quot;reasonable and necessary&quot; services). Providers may not bill for
services that do not meet the applicable standards.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>
The hospice is in a unique position to deliver this information to the health care
professionals on its staff and to the physicians who certify hospice services. Upon
request, a hospice must be able to provide documentation, such as physician orders and
other patient medical records, to support the level of services provided to a hospice
patient.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> The compliance officer should ensure that a
clear, comprehensive summary of the definitions for the different levels of hospice care<a
href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a> and applicable rules of the various Government and
private plans is prepared, disseminated, and explained to appropriate hospice personnel. </p>

<p>We recommend that hospices formulate policies and procedures that include periodic
clinical reviews, both prior and subsequent to billing for services, as a means of
verifying that patients are receiving only reasonable and necessary services. As part of
such reviews, hospices should examine the level, frequency, and duration of the services
they perform to determine, in consultation with a physician, whether patients' medical
conditions justify the level of services provided and billed. A hospice may choose to
incorporate this clinical review function into pre-existing quality assurance mechanisms
or any other quality assurance processes that are part of its conditions of participation.<a
href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><strong>e. Services Provided to Hospice Patients in Nursing Homes</strong> </p>

<p>Hospice services may be appropriate and beneficial to terminally ill nursing home
residents who wish to receive palliative care.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
However, the OIG has found hospices that enroll nursing home patients in hospice care are
particularly vulnerable to fraud and abuse.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
Appropriately, a hospice should set sufficient oversight controls in place to ensure that
care it provides to nursing home residents is appropriate, complete, and in accordance
with applicable laws and Federal health care program requirements. </p>

<p>When a resident of a nursing home elects the Medicare Hospice Benefit, the hospice and
the nursing home should jointly establish a coordinated plan of care that reflects the
hospice philosophy, and is based on an assessment of the individual's needs and unique
living situation in the nursing home. The coordinated plan should identify the care and
services that the nursing home will provide to be responsive to the unique needs of the
patient/resident and his or her expressed desire for hospice care. </p>

<p>In general, a hospice should involve nursing home personnel in assisting with the
administration of a patient's prescribed therapies included in the plan of care only to
the extent that the hospice would routinely utilize the services of a hospice patient's
family/caregiver in implementing the plan of care.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> To
satisfy the applicable Medicare conditions of participation in the nursing home context,
hospices should implement policies and procedures to ensure that: 

<ul>
  <li>the hospice makes all covered services available to meet the needs of a patient and does
    not routinely discharge patients in need of costly inpatient care;<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a></li>
  <li>the hospice retains professional responsibility for services (<u>e.g.</u>, personal
    care, nursing, medication for relieving pain control) furnished by nursing home staff;<a
    href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a></li>
  <li>all the care furnished by a nursing home related to the terminal illness or related
    conditions is in accordance with the hospice plan of care;<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the hospice and the nursing home communicate with each other when any changes are
    indicated to the plan of care, and each provider is aware of the other's responsibilities
    in implementing the plan of care and complete those respective functions;<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a></li>
  <li>evidence of the coordinated plan of care is present in the clinical records of both
    providers;<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a></li>
  <li>substantially all the core services are routinely provided directly by hospice employees
    <a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a> and the hospice does not rely on employees of the
    inpatient facility to furnish needed nursing, physician, counseling, or medical social
    services;<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the hospice keeps its forms and documentation of services separate from the nursing
    home's forms and documentation.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a> </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Concerns</strong> </p>

<p>The hospice should have policies and procedures in place with respect to compliance
with Federal and State anti-kickback statutes and other applicable laws.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>
Such policies should provide that: 

<ul>
  <li>all of the hospices's contracts and arrangements with actual or potential referral
    sources are reviewed carefully for compliance with all applicable statutes and
    regulations;<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a> </li>
  <li>the hospice does not submit or cause to be submitted to the Federal health care programs
    claims for patients who were referred to the hospice pursuant to contracts or financial
    arrangements that were designed to induce such referrals in violation of the anti-kickback
    statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulation; and </li>
  <li>the hospice does not offer or provide gifts, free services, or other incentives to
    patients, relatives of patients, physicians, nursing facilities, hospitals, contractors or
    other potential referral sources for the purpose of inducing referrals in violation of the
    anti-kickback statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulation.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, arrangements between nursing homes and hospices are vulnerable to fraud
and abuse because nursing home operators have control over the specific hospice or
hospices they will permit to provide hospice services to their residents.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
Moreover, hospice patients residing in nursing homes may be particularly desirable from a
hospice's financial standpoint.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>Therefore, with respect
to arrangements with nursing homes, a hospice should develop policies and procedures to
prevent the following practices from occurring, which may constitute potential kickbacks: 

<ul>
  <li>hospice offering free or below fair market value goods to induce a nursing home to refer
    patients to the hospice;</li>
  <li>hospice paying &quot;room and board&quot; payments to the nursing home in amounts in
    excess of what the nursing home would have received directly from Medicaid had the patient
    not been enrolled in hospice;<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a></li>
  <li>hospice paying above fair market value for &quot;additional&quot; non-core services that
    Medicaid does not consider to be included in its &quot;room and board&quot; payments to
    the nursing home;<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a></li>
  <li>hospice referring its patients to a nursing home to induce the nursing home to refer its
    patients to the hospice;</li>
  <li>hospice providing free (or below fair market value) care to nursing home patients, for
    whom the nursing home is receiving Medicare payment under the Medicare Skilled Nursing
    Facility Benefit, with the expectation that after the patient exhausts the skilled nursing
    facility benefit, the patient will receive hospice services from that hospice; and </li>
  <li>hospice providing staff at its expense to the nursing home to perform duties that
    otherwise would be performed by the nursing home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, the policies and procedures should specifically reference and take into
account the OIG's safe harbor regulations, which clarify those payment practices that
would be immune from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute, as well as the OIG's
civil money penalty and exclusion authorities.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>5. Retention of Records</strong> </p>

<p>Hospice compliance programs should provide for the implementation of a records system.
This system should establish policies and procedures regarding the creation, distribution,
retention, storage, retrieval and destruction of documents.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>
The two categories of documents developed under this system should include: (1) all
records and documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, medical records, and billing and claims
documentation) required either by Federal or State law for participation in Federal health
care programs<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> or any other applicable Federal and
State laws and regulations (<u>e.g.</u>, document retention requirements to maintain State
licensure); and (2) all records necessary to protect the integrity of the hospice's
compliance process and confirm the effectiveness of the program. </p>

<p>The second category includes: (1) documentation that employees were adequately trained;
(2) reports from the hospice's hotline, including the nature and results of any
investigation that was conducted; (3) documentation of corrective action, including
disciplinary action taken and policy improvements introduced, in response to any internal
investigation or audit; (4) modifications to the compliance program; (5) self-disclosures;
and (6) the results of the hospice's auditing and monitoring efforts.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>6. Compliance as an Element of a Performance Plan</strong> </p>

<p>Compliance programs should require that the promotion of, and adherence to, the
elements of the compliance program be a factor in evaluating the performance of all
employees, who should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and procedures.
In addition, all managers and supervisors should: 

<ul>
  <li>discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance policies
    and legal requirements pertinent to their function; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
    requirements is a condition of employment; and </li>
  <li>disclose to all supervised personnel that the hospice will take disciplinary action up
    to and including termination for violation of these policies or requirements. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to making performance of these duties an element in evaluations, a
compliance program should include a policy for sanctioning managers and supervisors who
fail to adequately instruct their subordinates or fail to detect noncompliance with
applicable policies and legal requirements, where reasonable diligence on the part of the
manager or supervisor would have led to the discovery of any problems or violations and
given the hospice the opportunity to correct them earlier. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all hospices should ensure that its employees understand the
importance of compliance. If a small hospice does not have a formal performance evaluation
structure, it should informally convey the employee's compliance responsibilities and the
importance of these responsibilities in a written job description or orientation
checklist. The applicable documentation should include a dated signature, with an
indication that the employee has received it and will be responsible for adherence to the
responsibilities expressed. </p>

<p><strong><u>B. DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>Every hospice should designate a compliance officer to serve as the focal point for
compliance activities. This responsibility may be the individual's sole duty or added to
other management responsibilities, depending upon the size and resources of the hospice
and the complexity of the task. Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate
authority is critical to the success of the program, necessitating the appointment of a
high-level official in the hospice with direct access to the hospice's president or CEO,
governing body, all other senior management, and legal counsel.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>
The officer should have sufficient funding and staff to perform his or her
responsibilities fully. Coordination and communication are the key functions of the
compliance officer with regard to planning, implementing and monitoring the compliance
program. </p>

<p>The compliance officer's primary responsibilities should include: 

<ul>
  <li>overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program;<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>reporting on a regular basis to the hospice's governing body, CEO and compliance
    committee (if applicable) on the progress of implementation, and assisting these
    components in establishing methods to improve the hospice's efficiency and quality of
    services, and to reduce the hospice's vulnerability to fraud, abuse and waste;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs, and
    in the law and policies and procedures of Government and private payor health plans;</li>
  <li>reviewing employees' certifications that they have received, read and understood the
    standards of conduct;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>developing, coordinating and participating in a multifaceted educational and training
    program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program, and seeks to ensure that
    all relevant employees and management are knowledgeable of, and comply with, pertinent
    Federal and State standards;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that independent contractors and agents who furnish physician, nursing, or
    other health care services to the clients of the hospice, or billing services to the
    hospice, are aware of the requirements of the hospice's compliance program with respect to
    eligibility, billing and marketing, among other things;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>coordinating personnel issues with the hospice's Human Resources/Personnel office (or
    its equivalent) to ensure that: (i) the National Practitioner Data Bank<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>has
    been checked with respect to all medical staff and independent contractors (as
    appropriate) and (ii) the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
    has been checked with respect to all employees, medical staff and independent contractors
    (as appropriate);<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assisting the hospice's financial management in coordinating internal compliance review
    and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of departments;</li>
  <li>independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including the
    flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding to
    reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action (<u>e.g.</u>,
    making necessary improvements to hospice policies and practices, taking appropriate
    disciplinary action, etc.) with all hospice departments, subcontracted providers and
    health care professionals under the hospice's control, and any other agents if
    appropriate; and</li>
  <li>continuing the momentum of the compliance program and the accomplishment of its
    objectives long after the initial years of implementation.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other
information that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to,
patient medical records, billing records, and records concerning the marketing efforts of
the facility and the hospice's arrangements with other parties, including employees,
physicians, professionals on staff, relevant independent contractors, suppliers, agents,
and supplemental staffing entities. This policy enables the compliance officer to review
contracts and obligations (seeking the advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that
may contain referral and payment provisions that could violate the anti-kickback statute
and other legal or regulatory requirements. </p>

<p>A small hospice may not have the need or the resources to hire or appoint a full time
compliance officer. However, each hospice should have a person in its organization (this
person may have other functional responsibilities) who can oversee the hospice's
compliance with applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and policies. The structure and
comprehensiveness of the hospice's compliance program will help determine the
responsibilities of each individual compliance officer. </p>

<p><strong>2. Compliance Committee</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that a compliance committee be established to advise the compliance
officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
When developing an appropriate team of people to serve as the hospice's compliance
committee, including the compliance officer, a hospice should consider a variety of skills
and personality traits that are expected from those in such positions.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a>
Once a hospice chooses the people that will accept the responsibilities vested in members
of the compliance committee, the hospice needs to train these individuals on the policies
and procedures of the compliance program, as well as how to discharge their duties. </p>

<p>The committee's functions should include: 

<ul>
  <li>analyzing the legal requirements with which it must comply, and specific risk areas;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assessing existing policies and procedures that address these risk areas for possible
    incorporation into the compliance program;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>working with appropriate hospice departments to develop standards of conduct and
    policies and procedures to promote compliance with legal and ethical requirements;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
    development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's standards,
    policies, and procedures as part of its daily operations;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>determining the appropriate strategy/approach to promote compliance with the program and
    detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other fraud reporting
    mechanisms;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>developing a system to solicit, evaluate, and respond to complaints and problems; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
    identifying troublesome issues and deficient areas experienced by the hospice, and
    implementing corrective and preventive action. </li>
</ul>

<p>The committee may also address other functions as the compliance concept becomes part
of the overall hospice operating structure and daily routine. </p>

<p>The compliance committee is an extension of the compliance officer and provides the
organization with increased oversight. The OIG recognizes that small hospices may not have
the resources or the need to establish a compliance committee. However, when potential
problems are identified, the OIG recommends the small hospices supplier create a
'taskforce,' if appropriate, to address the problem. The members of the taskforce may vary
depending upon the issue. </p>

<p><strong>C. <u>CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong> </p>

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, employees,
volunteers, nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals, and the continual
retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant elements of an effective
compliance program. As part of their compliance programs, hospices should require
personnel to attend specific training on a periodic basis, including appropriate training
in Federal and State statutes, regulations, and guidelines, and the policies of private
payors, and training in corporate ethics, which emphasizes the organization's commitment
to compliance with these legal requirements and policies.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>These training programs should include sessions highlighting the organization's
compliance program, summarizing fraud and abuse laws, Federal health care program
requirements, claim development and submission processes, patient rights, and marketing
practices that reflect current legal and program standards. The organization must take
steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all affected employees,
physicians, independent contractors, and other significant agents, <u>e.g.</u>, by
requiring participation in training programs and disseminating publications that explain
specific requirements in a practical manner.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>
Managers of specific departments or groups can assist in identifying areas that require
training and in carrying out such training.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a> Training
instructors may come from outside or inside the organization, but must be qualified to
present the subject matter involved and experienced enough in the issues presented to
adequately field questions and coordinate discussions among those being trained. New
employees should be trained early in their employment.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
Training programs and materials should be designed to take into account the skills,
experience, and knowledge of the individual trainees. The compliance officer should
document any formal training undertaken by the hospice as part of the compliance program. </p>

<p>A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training, and training in several
different languages, particularly where a hospice has a culturally diverse staff, should
be implemented so that all affected employees are knowledgeable of the institution's
standards of conduct and procedures for alerting senior management to problems and
concerns.<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a> In addition to specific training in the
risk areas identified in section II.A.2, above, primary training for appropriate corporate
officers, managers, and other hospice staff should include such topics as: 

<ul>
  <li>Government and private payor reimbursement principles;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>general prohibitions on paying or receiving remuneration to induce referrals; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>improper alterations to clinical records;<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>providing hospice services with proper authorization;</li>
  <li>patient rights and patient education;</li>
  <li>compliance with Medicare conditions of participation; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational
programs are particularly relevant to a hospice's marketing and financial personnel, in
that the pressure to meet business goals may render these employees vulnerable to engaging
in prohibited practices. </p>

<p>The OIG suggests that all relevant levels of personnel be made part of various
educational and training programs of the hospice.<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a>
Employees should be required to have a minimum number of educational hours per year, as
appropriate, as part of their employment responsibilities.<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a>
For example, for certain employees involved in the hospice admission functions, periodic
training in applicable reimbursement coverage and eligibility requirements should be
required. In hospices with high employee turnover, periodic training updates are critical.
<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the format of the training program will vary depending upon the
resources of the hospice. For example, a small hospice may want to create a video for each
type of training session so new employees can receive training in a timely manner.<a
href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that attendance and participation in training programs be made a
condition of continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements
should result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is
serious. Adherence to the provisions of the compliance program, such as training
requirements, should be a factor in the annual evaluation of each employee. The hospice
should retain adequate records of its training of employees, including attendance logs and
material distributed at training sessions. </p>

<p><strong>D. <u>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and hospice employees is
equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program and the
reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse, and waste. Written confidentiality and
non-retaliation policies should be developed and distributed to all employees to encourage
communication and the reporting of incidents of potential fraud.<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>
The compliance committee should also develop independent reporting paths for an employee
to report fraud, waste, or abuse so that employees can feel comfortable reporting outside
the normal chain of command and supervisors or other personnel cannot divert such reports.<a
href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG encourages the establishment of a procedure so that hospice personnel may seek
clarification from the compliance officer or members of the compliance committee in the
event of any confusion or question with regard to a hospice policy, practice, or
procedure. Questions and responses should be documented and dated and, if appropriate,
shared with other staff so that standards, policies, practices, and procedures can be
updated and improved to reflect any necessary changes or clarifications. The compliance
officer may want to solicit employee input in developing these communication and reporting
systems. </p>

<p><strong>2. Hotlines</strong> <strong>and Other Forms of Communication</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG encourages the use of hotlines,<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a> e-mails,
written memoranda, newsletters, suggestion boxes, and other forms of information exchange
to maintain these open lines of communication.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a> If
the hospice establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available
to all employees and independent contractors, possibly by circulating the number on wallet
cards or conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>
Employees should be permitted to report matters on an anonymous basis. Matters reported
through the hotline or other communication sources that suggest substantial violations of
compliance policies, Federal health care program requirements, regulations, or statutes
should be documented and investigated promptly to determine their veracity. A log should
be maintained by the compliance officer that records such calls, including the nature of
any investigation and its results.<a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a> Such information
should be included in reports to the governing body, the CEO, and compliance committee.<a
href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a> Further, while the hospice should always strive to
maintain the confidentiality of an employee's identity, it should also explicitly
communicate that there may be a point where the individual's identity may become known or
may have to be revealed in certain instances. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by employees who may have
participated in illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex
legal and management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The
compliance officer should work closely with legal counsel, who can provide guidance
regarding such issues. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that protecting anonymity may be infeasible for small hospices.
However, the OIG believes all hospice employees, when seeking answers to questions or
reporting potential instances of fraud and abuse, should know to whom to turn to for
attention and should be able to do so without fear of retribution. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><strong>E. <u>AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong> </p>

<p>An ongoing evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program. The OIG
believes that an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of its
implementation and regular reporting to senior hospice or corporate officers.<a
href="#N_120_"><sup>(120)</sup></a> Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring,
including reports of suspected noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance
officer and shared with the hospice's senior management and the compliance committee. The
extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors such as the size
and available resources, prior history of noncompliance, and the risk factors that a
particular hospice confronts. </p>

<p>Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and
ensure compliance is the performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or
external auditors who have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes,
regulations, and Federal health care program requirements. The audits should focus on the
hospice's programs or divisions, including external relationships with third-party
contractors, specifically those with substantive exposure to Government enforcement
actions. At a minimum, these audits should be designed to address the hospice's compliance
with laws governing kickback arrangements, claim development and submission,
reimbursement, eligibility, and marketing. The audits and reviews should inquire into the
hospice's compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation and the specific rules
and policies that have been the focus of particular attention on the part of the Medicare
fiscal intermediaries or carriers, and law enforcement, as evidenced by educational and
other communications from OIG Special Fraud Alerts, OIG audits and evaluations, and law
enforcement's initiatives.<a href="#N_121_"><sup>(121)</sup></a> In addition, the hospice
should focus on any areas of concern that are specific to the individual hospice and have
been identified by any entity, whether Federal, State, or internal. </p>

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer
to identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_122_"><sup>(122)</sup></a>
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine
the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for
legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer and hospice management may want to
limit any corrective action or take no action. If it is determined that the deviation was
caused by improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including fraud and systemic
problems, the hospice should take prompt steps to correct the problem. Any overpayments
discovered as a result of such deviations should be returned promptly to the affected
payor, with appropriate documentation and a sufficiently detailed explanation of the
reason for the refund.<a href="#N_123_"><sup>(123)</sup></a> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at least annual)
reviews of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>,
whether there has been appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, training,
ongoing educational programs, and disciplinary actions, among other elements.<a
href="#N_124_"><sup>(124)</sup></a> This process will verify actual conformance by all
departments with the compliance program and may identify the necessity for improvements to
be made to the compliance program, as well as the hospice's operations. Such reviews could
support a determination that appropriate records have been created and maintained to
document the implementation of an effective program.<a href="#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a>
However, when monitoring discloses that deviations were not detected in a timely manner
due to program deficiencies, proper modifications must be implemented. Such evaluations,
when developed with the support of management, can help ensure compliance with the
hospice's policies and procedures. </p>

<p>As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider
techniques such as: 

<ul>
  <li>visits and interviews of patients at their residences;</li>
  <li>analysis of utilization patterns;</li>
</ul>

<p><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">

<ul>
  <li>testing clinical and hospice admission staff on their knowledge of reimbursement
    coverage criteria (<u>e.g.</u>, present hypothetical scenarios of situations experienced
    in daily practice and assess responses);</li>
  <li>assessment of existing relationships with physicians, nursing homes,<a href="#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a>
    hospitals, and other potential referral sources;</li>
  <li>unannounced mock audits and investigations;</li>
  <li>reevaluation of deficiencies cited in past surveys for Medicare conditions of
    participation;</li>
  <li>examination of hospice complaint logs;</li>
  <li>checking personnel records to determine whether any individuals who have been
    reprimanded for compliance issues in the past are among those currently engaged in
    improper conduct; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of a broad cross-section of the
    hospice's employees and staff;</li>
  <li>evaluation of the timeliness of physician referrals and physician signatures for hospice
    certifications;</li>
  <li>reviews of clinical documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, terminal illness certification, plan of
    care, nursing notes, etc.), financial records, and other source documents that support
    claims for reimbursement;</li>
  <li>validation of qualifications of hospice physicians and other hospice staff, including
    verification of applicable state license renewals; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>evaluation of written materials and documentation outlining the hospice's policies and
    procedures; and </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>trend analyses, or longitudinal studies, that uncover deviations, positive or negative,
    in specific areas over a given period. </li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewers should: 

<ul>
  <li>have the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential issues
    with the subject matter that is reviewed;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>be objective and independent of line management to the extent reasonably possible;<a
    href="#N_127_"><sup>(127)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel, and all
    relevant areas of operation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing body,
    and members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but no less often than
    annually; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as a hospice is required by its conditions of participation to conduct &quot;an
ongoing, comprehensive, integrated, self-assessment of the quality and appropriateness of
care provided,&quot;<a href="#N_128_"><sup>(128)</sup></a> the OIG believes that a hospice
should monitor its compliance with the Federal health care program requirements in the
same fashion. Furthermore, just as a hospice is required by its conditions of
participation to use its quality assurance findings to correct identified problems and
revise hospice policies if necessary to improve patient care,<a href="#N_129_"><sup>(129)</sup></a>
the OIG believes that a hospice's management should take whatever steps are necessary to
correct identified compliance problems and prevent them from recurring. In certain cases,
subsequent reviews or studies would be advisable to ensure that the recommended corrective
actions have been implemented successfully. </p>

<p>While conducting its monitoring and auditing efforts, as well as its daily operations,
a hospice should document its efforts to comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and
Federal health care program requirements. For example, where a hospice, in its efforts to
comply with a particular statute, regulation or program requirement, requests advice from
a Government agency (including a Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier) charged with
administering a Federal health care program, the hospice should document and retain a
record of the request and any written or oral response. This step is extremely important
if the hospice intends to rely on that response to guide it in future decisions, actions,
or claim reimbursement requests or appeals. A log of oral inquiries between the hospice
and third parties will help the organization document its attempts at compliance. In
addition, the hospice agency should maintain records relevant to the issue of whether its
reliance was &quot;reasonable&quot; and whether it exercised due diligence in developing
procedures and practices to implement the advice. </p>

<p>The extent of a hospice's audit should depend on the hospice's identified risk areas
and resources. If the hospice comes under Government scrutiny in the future, the
Government will assess whether or not the hospice developed a comprehensive audit based
upon identified risk areas and resources. If the Government determines the hospice failed
to develop an adequate audit program, given its resources, the Government will be less
likely to afford the hospice favorable treatment under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. </p>

<p><strong>F. <u>ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Discipline Policy and Actions</strong> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for corporate officers, managers, employees, and other health care professionals who have
failed to comply with the hospice's standards of conduct, policies and procedures, Federal
health care program requirements, or Federal and State laws, or those who have otherwise
engaged in wrongdoing, which have the potential to impair the hospice's status as a
reliable, honest, and trustworthy health care provider. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that the compliance program should include a written policy statement
setting forth the degrees of disciplinary actions that may be imposed upon corporate
officers, managers, employees, physicians, and other health care professionals for failing
to comply with the hospice's standards and policies and applicable statutes and
regulations. Intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject transgressors to
significant sanctions. Such sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension,
termination, or financial penalties, as appropriate. Each situation must be considered on
a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate sanction. The written standards of
conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling disciplinary problems and those
who will be responsible for taking appropriate action. Some disciplinary actions can be
handled by department or agency managers, while others may have to be resolved by a senior
hospice administrator. Disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible
employee's failure to detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence or
reckless conduct. Personnel should be advised by the hospice that disciplinary action will
be taken on a fair and equitable basis. Managers and supervisors should be made aware that
they have a responsibility to discipline employees in an appropriate and consistent
manner. </p>

<p>It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of disciplinary standards for improper
conduct and to educate officers and other hospice employees regarding these standards. The
consequences of noncompliance should be consistently applied and enforced, in order for
the disciplinary policy to have the required deterrent effect. All levels of employees
should be potentially subject to the same types of disciplinary action for the commission
of similar offenses. The commitment to compliance applies to all personnel levels within a
hospice. The OIG believes that corporate officers, managers, supervisors, clinical staff,
and other health care professionals should be held accountable for failing to comply with,
or for the foreseeable failure of their subordinates to adhere to, the applicable
standards, laws, and procedures. </p>

<p><strong>2. New Employee Policy</strong> </p>

<p>For all new employees who have discretionary authority to make decisions that may
involve compliance with the law or compliance oversight, hospices should conduct a
reasonable and prudent background investigation, including a reference check,<a
href="#N_130_"><sup>(130)</sup></a> as part of every such employment application. The
application should specifically require the applicant to disclose any criminal conviction,<a
href="#N_131_"><sup>(131)</sup></a> as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(i), or exclusion
action. Pursuant to the compliance program, hospice policies should prohibit the
employment of individuals who have been recently convicted of a criminal offense related
to health care<a href="#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a> or who are listed as debarred,
excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs.<a
href="#N_133_"><sup>(133)</sup></a>In addition, pending the resolution of any criminal
charges or proposed debarment or exclusion, the OIG recommends that an individual who is
the subject of such actions should be removed from direct responsibility for or
involvement in any Federal health care program. That individual's salary should not be
paid in whole or part, directly or indirectly, by Federal health care programs or
otherwise with Federal funds.<a href="#N_134_"><sup>(134)</sup></a> With regard to current
employees or independent contractors, if resolution of the matter results in conviction,
debarment or exclusion, the hospice should terminate its employment or other contract
arrangement with the individual or contractor. </p>

<p><strong>G. <u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION
INITIATIVES</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Violations and Investigations</strong> </p>

<p>Violations of a hospice's compliance program, failures to comply with applicable
Federal or State law, and other types of misconduct threaten a hospice's status as a
reliable, honest and trustworthy provider capable of participating in Federal health care
programs. Detected but uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the mission,
reputation and legal status of the hospice. Consequently, upon reports or reasonable
indications of suspected noncompliance, it is important that the compliance officer or
other management officials immediately investigate the conduct in question to determine
whether a material violation of applicable law or the requirements of the compliance
program has occurred, and if so, take decisive steps to correct the problem.<a
href="#N_135_"><sup>(135)</sup></a> As appropriate, such steps may include an immediate
referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities, a corrective action plan,<a
href="#N_136_"><sup>(136)</sup></a> a report to the Government<a href="#N_137_"><sup>(137)</sup></a>
and the return of any overpayments, if applicable. </p>

<p>Where potential fraud or False Claims Act liability is not involved, the OIG recommends
that normal repayment channels should be used for returning overpayments to the Government
as they are discovered. However, even if the overpayment detection and return process is
working and is being monitored by the hospice's audit or billing divisions, the OIG still
believes that the compliance officer needs to be made aware of these overpayments,
violations or deviations that may reveal trends or patterns indicative of a systemic
problem. </p>

<p>Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will
probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents. Some hospices should
consider engaging outside counsel, auditors or health care experts to assist in an
investigation. Records of the investigation should contain documentation of the alleged
violation, a description of the investigative process (including the objectivity of the
investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of interview notes and key documents, a
log of the witnesses interviewed and the documents reviewed, the results of the
investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken, and the corrective action
implemented. While any action taken as the result of an investigation will necessarily
vary depending upon the hospice and the situation, hospices should strive for some
consistency by utilizing sound practices and disciplinary protocols.<a href="#N_138_"><sup>(138)</sup></a>
Further, after a reasonable period, the compliance officer should review the circumstances
that formed the basis for the investigation to determine whether similar problems have
been uncovered or modifications of the compliance program are necessary to prevent and
detect other inappropriate conduct or violations. </p>

<p>If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer
believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of
employees under investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work
activity until the investigation is completed (unless an internal or Government-led
undercover operation known to the hospice is in effect). In addition, the compliance
officer should take appropriate steps to secure or prevent the destruction of documents or
other evidence relevant to the investigation. If the hospice determines that disciplinary
action is warranted, it should be prompt and imposed in accordance with the hospice's
written standards of disciplinary action. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><strong>2. Reporting</strong> </p>

<p>If the compliance officer, compliance committee, or management official discovers
credible evidence of misconduct from any source and, after a reasonable inquiry, has
reason to believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil, or administrative law,
then the hospice should promptly report the existence of misconduct to the appropriate
Federal and State authorities<a href="#N_139_"><sup>(139)</sup></a>within a reasonable
period, but not more than 60 days<a href="#N_140_"><sup>(140)</sup></a> after determining
that there is credible evidence of a violation.<a href="#N_141_"><sup>(141)</sup></a>
Prompt reporting will demonstrate the hospice's good faith and willingness to work with
governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem. In addition, reporting such
conduct will be considered a mitigating factor by the OIG in determining administrative
sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments and exclusion), if the reporting provider
becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_142_"><sup>(142)</sup></a> </p>

<p>When reporting misconduct to the Government, a hospice should provide all evidence
relevant to the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State law(s) and potential cost
impact. The compliance officer, under advice of counsel, and with guidance from the
governmental authorities, could be requested to continue to investigate the reported
violation. Once the investigation is completed, the compliance officer should be required
to notify the appropriate governmental authority of the outcome of the investigation,
including a description of the impact of the alleged violation on the operation of the
applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries. If the investigation ultimately
reveals that criminal, civil or administrative violations have occurred, the appropriate
Federal and State authorities<a href="#N_143_"><sup>(143)</sup></a> should be notified
immediately. </p>

<p>As previously stated, the hospice should take appropriate corrective action, including
prompt identification of any overpayment to the affected payor and the imposition of
proper disciplinary action. If potential fraud or violations of the False Claims Act are
involved, any repayment of the overpayment should be made as part of the discussion with
the Government following a report of the matter to law enforcement authorities. Otherwise,
normal repayment channels should be used for repaying identified overpayments.<a
href="#N_144_"><sup>(144)</sup></a> Failure to disclose overpayments within a reasonable
period of time could be interpreted as an intentional attempt to conceal the overpayment
from the Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation
with respect to the hospice, as well as any individuals who may have been involved.<a
href="#N_145_"><sup>(145)</sup></a>For this reason, hospice compliance programs should
emphasize that overpayments obtained from Medicare or other Federal health care programs
should be promptly disclosed and returned to the payor that made the erroneous payment. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all hospices, regardless of size, should ensure they are reporting the
results of any overpayments or violations to the appropriate entity and taking the
appropriate corrective action to remedy the identified deficiency. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>III. ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</strong>
</p>

<p>Because the Government views the existence of a compliance program as a mitigating
factor when determining culpability regarding allegations of fraud and abuse only if the
compliance program is &quot;effective,&quot; how a hospice may assess its compliance
program becomes quite significant. A hospice, as well as any other type of health care
provider, should consider the attributes of each individual element of its compliance
program to assess the program's &quot;effectiveness&quot; as a whole. Examining the
comprehensiveness of policies and procedures implemented to satisfy these elements is
merely the first step. Evaluating how a compliance program performs during a provider's
day-to-day operations becomes the critical indicator.<a href="#N_146_"><sup>(146)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>As previously stated, a compliance program should require the development and
distribution of written compliance policies, standards and practices that identify
specific areas of risk and vulnerability to a hospice. One way to judge whether these
policies, standards and practices measure up is to observe how an organization's employees
react to them. Do employees consistently experience recurring pitfalls because they lack
guidance on certain issues not adequately covered in company policies? Are employees
flagrantly disobeying an organization's standards of conduct because they observe no
sincere buy-in from senior management? Do employees have trouble understanding policies
and procedures because they are written in legalese or at difficult reading levels? Does
an organization routinely experience systematic billing failures because employees are
ill-instructed how to implement written policies and practices? Written compliance
policies, standards and practices are only as good as an organization's commitment to
apply them in practice. </p>

<p>Every hospice should designate a compliance officer or contact to serve as the focal
point of compliance activities, and, if appropriate, a compliance committee to advise and
assist the compliance officer. An organization needs to seriously consider whoever fills
such integral roles and periodically monitor how the individuals chosen satisfy their
responsibilities. Does a compliance officer have sufficient professional experience
working with billing, clinical records, documentation, and auditing principles to perform
assigned responsibilities fully? Has a compliance officer or compliance committee been
negligent in ensuring an organization's compliance due to inadequate funding, staff, and
authority necessary to carry out their jobs? Did adding the compliance officer function to
a key management position with other significant duties compromise the goals of the
compliance program (<u>e.g.</u>, chief financial officer who discounts certain
overpayments identified to improve the company's bottom line profits)? Since a compliance
officer and a compliance committee can potentially have a significant impact on how
effectively a compliance program is implemented, those functions should not be taken for
granted. </p>

<p>As evidenced throughout this guidance, the proper education and training of corporate
officers, managers, health care professionals and other applicable employees of a
provider, and the continual retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant
elements of an effective compliance program. Accordingly, such efforts should be routinely
evaluated. Are employees trained frequently enough? Do employees fail post-training tests
that evaluate knowledge of compliance? Do training sessions and materials adequately
summarize important aspects of the organization's compliance program, such as fraud and
abuse laws, Federal health care program requirements, and claim development and submission
processes? Are training instructors qualified to present the subject matter and
experienced enough to duly field questions? When thorough compliance training is
periodically conducted, employees receive the reinforcement they need to ensure an
effective compliance program. </p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and a provider's employees
is equally important to the success of a compliance program. In today's intensive
regulatory environment, the OIG believes that a provider cannot possibly have an effective
compliance program if it receives minimal or no feedback from its employees regarding
compliance matters. For instance, if a compliance officer does not receive appropriate
inquiries from employees: Do policies and procedures fail to adequately guide employees to
whom and when they should be communicating compliance matters? Do employees fear
retaliation if they report misconduct? Are employees reporting issues not related to
compliance through the wrong channels? Do employees have bad-faith, ulterior motives for
reporting? Regardless of the means that a provider employs, whether it be telephone
hotline, email, or suggestion boxes, employees should seek clarification from compliance
staff in the event of any confusion or question dealing with compliance policies,
practices or procedures. </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for corporate officers, managers, health care professionals and other employees who have
failed to adhere to an organization's standards of conduct, Federal health care program
requirements or Federal or State laws. The number and caliber of disciplinary actions
taken by an organization can be insightful. Have appropriate sanctions been applied to
compliance misconduct? Are sanctions applied to all employees consistently, regardless of
an employee's level in the corporate hierarchy? Have double-standards in discipline bred
cynicism among employees? When disciplinary action is not taken seriously or applied
haphazardly, such practices reflect poorly on <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>senior management's commitment to foster compliance as well as the effectiveness of an
organization's compliance program in general. </p>

<p>Another critical component of a successful compliance program is an ongoing monitoring
and auditing process. The extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on
factors such as the size and available resources, prior history of noncompliance, and risk
factors of a particular hospice. The hallmark of effective monitoring and auditing efforts
is how an organization determines the parameters of its reviews. Do audits focus on all
pertinent departments of an organization? Does an audit cover compliance with all
applicable laws and Federal health care program requirements? Are results of past audits,
pre-established baselines or prior deficiencies reevaluated? Are the elements of the
compliance program monitored? Are auditing techniques valid and conducted by objective
reviewers? The extent and sincerity of an organization's efforts to confirm its compliance
often proves to be a revealing determinant of a compliance program's effectiveness. </p>

<p>As was expressed in the last section of this guidance, it is essential that the
compliance officer or other management officials immediately investigate reports or
reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance. If a material violation of applicable
law or compliance program requirements has occurred, a provider must take decisive steps
to correct the problem. Providers who do not thoroughly investigate misconduct leave
themselves open to undiscovered fraud, waste and abuse. When a provider learns of certain
issues, does it knowingly disregard associated legal exposure? Is there a consistent and
methodical approach to the correlation between compliance issues identified and the
corrective action necessary to remedy? Are isolated overpayment matters properly resolved
through normal repayment channels? Is credible evidence of misconduct that may violate
criminal, civil or administrative law promptly reported to the appropriate Federal and
State authorities? If any step in this process of responding to detected offenses is
circumvented or improperly handled, such conduct would most likely demonstrate an
ineffective compliance program, as well as potentially result in criminal, civil or
administrative liability. </p>

<p>Documentation is the key to demonstrating the effectiveness of a provider's compliance
program. For example, documentation of the following should be maintained: audit results;
logs of hotline calls and their resolution; corrective actions plans; due diligence
efforts regarding business transactions; records of employee training, including the
number of training hours; disciplinary action; and modification and distribution of
policies and procedures. Given that the OIG is encouraging self-disclosure of overpayments
and billing irregularities, maintaining a record of disclosures and refunds to the health
care programs is strongly endorsed. A documented practice of refunding of overpayments and
self-disclosing incidents of non-compliance with Federal health care program requirements
can serve as evidence of a meaningful compliance effort by a hospice. </p>

<p>Hospices, as well as all health care providers, should acknowledge that it is their
responsibility to formulate policies, procedures, and practices that are tailored to their
own operations, and that are comprehensive enough to ensure compliance with all applicable
Federal health care program requirements. An organization is in the best position to
validate the suitability of its compliance efforts based upon its own particular
circumstances. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation to the process
necessary to develop an effective and cost-efficient hospice compliance program. As
previously stated, however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources
of an individual hospice, depending upon its particular corporate structure, mission and
employee composition. The statutes, regulations and guidelines of the Federal and State
health insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private health
plans, should be integrated into every hospice's compliance program. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches
millions of beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly
evolving. The time is right for hospices to implement a strong voluntary health care
compliance program. As stated throughout this guidance, compliance is a dynamic process
that helps to ensure that hospices and other health care providers are better able to
fulfill their commitment to ethical behavior, as well as meet the changes and challenges
being imposed upon them by Congress and private insurers. Ultimately, it is OIG's hope
that a voluntarily created compliance program will enable hospices to meet their goals,
improve the quality of patient care, and substantially reduce fraud, waste and abuse, as
well as the cost of health care to Federal, State and private health insurers. <br

&quot;hospice program&quot; is defined in 42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd). <a name="N_2_"></a></p>

<p>2. Palliative care is an intensive program of care that focuses on the relief of
pain and suffering associated with a terminal illness. Through this emphasis on palliative
rather than curative services, individuals have a choice whenever conventional approaches
for medical treatment may no longer be appropriate. Hospice addresses the needs of
terminally ill individuals by including the patient and family, specially trained
volunteers, caregivers from the community, and representatives from medicine, nursing,
social work and spiritual counseling in the caregiving team. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>

<p>3. Recent case law suggests that the failure of a corporate director to attempt in
good faith to institute a compliance program in certain situations may be a breach of a
director's fiduciary obligation. <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In re Caremark International Inc.
Derivative Litigation</u>, 698 A.2d 959 (Ct. Chanc. Del. 1996). <a name="N_4_"></a></p>

<p>4. The conclusion of a recent report by the United States General Accounting Office
(GAO) to Congress stated that &quot;despite the investment of time and resources that
compliance programs entail, many hospitals believe the benefits of these programs . . .
outweigh their costs . . . and providers themselves believe that compliance programs can
reduce improper Medicare payments.&quot; <u>See</u> GAO report GAO/HEHS-99-59 (April
1999). <a name="N_5_"></a></p>

compliance program that pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the
appropriateness of administrative sanctions. <u>See</u> 62 FR 67392 (December 24, 1997).
The burden is on the provider to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of a compliance
program. Further, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, provides that a person who
has violated the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government, in
certain circumstances will be subject to not less than double, as opposed to treble,

<p>10. <u>E.g.</u>, a resolution by the board of directors, owner(s) or president,
where applicable, and the allocation of adequate resources to ensure that each of the
elements is addressed. <a name="N_11_"></a></p>

<p>11. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>,
8A1.2, Application Note 3(k). The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and
practices for the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe the appropriate sanctions
for offenders convicted of Federal crimes. <a name="N_12_"></a></p>

<p>12. The integral functions of a compliance officer and a corporate compliance
committee in implementing an effective compliance program are discussed throughout this
compliance program guidance. However, the OIG recognizes that a hospice may tailor the
structure of those positions in consideration of the size and design of the hospice, while
endeavoring to address and accomplish all of the underlying objectives of a compliance
officer and a corporate compliance committee. <u>See</u> section II.B. and accompanying
notes. <a name="N_13_"></a></p>

<p>13. The term &quot;Federal health care programs&quot; is applied in this document
as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(f), which includes any plan or program that provides
health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded
directly, in whole or in part, by the United States Government (<u>i.e.</u>, via programs
such as Medicare, Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Black Lung, or the Longshore and
Harbor Worker's Compensation Act) or any State health plan (<u>e.g.</u>, Medicaid, or a
program receiving funds from block grants for social services or child health services).
Also, for the purposes of this document, the term &quot;Federal health care program
requirements&quot; refers to the statutes, regulations, rules, requirements, directives
and instructions governing Medicare, Medicaid and all other Federal health care programs. <a
name="N_14_"></a></p>

<p>14. According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization must have
established compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other
agents in order to receive sentencing credit for an &quot;effective&quot; compliance
program. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines define &quot;agent&quot; as &quot;any
individual, including a director, an officer, an employee or an independent contractor,
authorized to act on behalf of the organization.&quot; <u>See</u> United States Sentencing
Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3. <a
name="N_15_"></a></p>

<p>15. The OIG strongly encourages high-level involvement by the hospice's governing
body, CEO, chief operating officer, general counsel, and chief financial officer, as well
as other medical or clinical personnel, as appropriate, in the development of standards of
conduct. Such involvement should help communicate a strong and explicit statement of
compliance goals and standards. <a name="N_16_"></a></p>

<p>16. When the term &quot;hospice physician&quot; is applied in this document, it
refers to the hospice's medical director or the physician member of a hospice's
Interdisciplinary Group. The &quot;Interdisciplinary Group,&quot; which is composed of at
least a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, registered nurse, medical social worker, and
pastoral or other counselor, is responsible for: (1) participation in the establishment of
the plan of care; (2) provision or supervision of hospice care and services; (3) periodic
review and updating of the plan of care for each individual receiving hospice care; and
(4) establishment of policies governing the day-to-day provision of hospice care and
services. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.68. <a name="N_17_"></a></p>

<p>17. The OIG recognizes that not all standards, policies, and procedures need to be
communicated to all employees. However, the OIG believes that the bulk of the standards
that relate to complying with fraud and abuse laws and other ethical areas should be
addressed and made part of all affected employees' training. The hospice must decide which
additional educational programs should be limited to the different levels of employees,
based on job functions and areas of responsibility. <a name="N_18_"></a></p>

<p>18. A hospice can conduct focus groups composed of managers from various
departments to solicit their concerns and ideas about compliance risks that may be then
addresses by the hospice's policies and procedures. Such employee participation in the
development of the hospice's compliance program can promote its credibility and foster
employee acceptance of the program. <a name="N_19_"></a></p>

<p>19. The OIG periodically issues Special Fraud Alerts setting forth activities
believed to raise legal and enforcement issues. For example, <u>see</u> OIG Special Fraud
Alert - &quot;Fraud and Abuse in Nursing Home Arrangements with Hospices&quot; (March
1998); <u>see also</u> OIG Medicare Advisory Bulletin on Hospice Benefits (November 1995).
Hospice compliance programs should require that the legal staff, compliance officer, or
other appropriate personnel carefully consider any and all Special Fraud Alerts issued by
the OIG that relate to hospices. Moreover, the compliance programs should address the
ramifications of failing to cease and correct any conduct criticized in a Special Fraud
Alert, if applicable to hospices, or to take reasonable action to prevent such conduct
from reoccurring in the future. If appropriate, a hospice should take the steps described
in section II.G. regarding investigations, reporting, and correction of identified
problems. <a name="N_20_"></a></p>

<p>20. <u>See</u> OIG report OEI-04-93-00270 - &quot;Medicare Hospice Beneficiaries:
Services and Eligibility.&quot; <a name="N_21_"></a></p>

<p>21. Hospices may also want to consult the OIG's Work Plan when conducting the risk
assessment. The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG intends to address in
the applicable fiscal year. It should be noted that the priorities in the Work Plan are
subject to modification and revision as the year progresses and it does not represent a
complete or final list of areas of concern to the OIG. The Work Plan is currently
available on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a name="N_22_"></a></p>

<p>22. A hospice must ensure that an individual (or authorized representative) is
informed about the palliative nature of the care and services that may be provided if the
individual desires to elect the Medicare Hospice Benefit. 42 CFR 418.62. The decision to
elect the Medicare Hospice Benefit has significant consequences because the patient waives
the right to receive standard Medicare benefits related to the terminal illness, including
all treatment for the purposes of curing the terminal illness. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.
1395d(d). A patient's hospice election statement must include the following items of
information: (1) identification of the particular hospice that will provide care to the
individual; (2) the individual's or representative's acknowledgment that he or she has
been given a full understanding of hospice care; (3) the individual's or representative's
acknowledgment that he or she understands that certain Medicare services are waived by the
election; (4) the effective date of the election; and (5) the signature of the individual
or representative. <u>See</u> Medicare Hospice Manual  210. <a name="N_23_"></a></p>

<p>23. For a hospice patient to receive reimbursement for hospice services under
Medicare, the patient must be &quot;terminally ill.&quot; <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395d(a).
An individual is considered to be &quot;terminally ill&quot; if the individual has a
medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is six months or less if the
illness runs its normal course. 42 CFR 418.3. In March 1995, Operation Restore Trust
(ORT), a joint initiative, was established between the OIG, HCFA, and Administration on
Aging. Among its projects, ORT assessed the medical eligibility for hospice services in
the five largest States in terms of Medicare spending (New York, Florida, Illinois, Texas
and California). Through ORT activities, it was discovered that many beneficiaries
receiving Medicare hospice benefits did not have a terminal illness as defined by
Medicare. <u>See </u>OIG report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure
Validity of Medicare Hospice Enrollments.&quot; <u>See also</u> section II.A.3.a. and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_24_"></a></p>

<p>24. When an individual makes an election to receive services covered by the
Medicare Hospice Benefit, that individual waives the right to receive Medicare
reimbursement for any treatment related to his or her terminal illness. Accordingly, a
hospice should ensure it is not involved with a health care provider who the hospice knows
submits claims for the following services that are unallowable for reimbursement under the
Medicare Hospice Benefit: (1) standard Medicare benefits for treatment of the terminal
illness; (2) treatment by another hospice not arranged for by the patient's hospice; and
(3) care from another provider that duplicates care the hospice is required to furnish. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C. 1395d(d). It is expected that the hospice provider will work with other
providers to coordinate care and ensure appropriate billing if these situations occur.
Where a single episode of care culminates in an inpatient admission and also involves
services by two different providers, the need for a clear record from both providers is
critical. <a name="N_25_"></a></p>

<p>25. In other words, knowing denial of needed care in order to keep costs low. A
hospice is accountable for the appropriate allocation and utilization of its resources in
order to provide optimal care consistent with the needs of a patient, family and/or lawful
representative. When a patient is receiving hospice care, the hospice is paid a
predetermined fee for each day during the length of care, no matter how much care the
hospice actually provides. This means that a hospice may have a financial incentive to
reduce the number of services provided to each patient, because the hospice will get paid
the same amount regardless of the number of services provided. The OIG has received
complaints about hospices neglecting patient needs and ignoring reasonable requests for
treatment, including complaints about limited availability of durable medical equipment
for patients as their medical condition decreases and failure to provide continuous care
for periods of crisis due to staff shortages. The OIG has also been alerted to improper
utilization of services that occurs when a hospice encourages a patient to revoke the
Medicare Hospice Benefit for the purpose of obtaining expensive care under the standard
Medicare benefits, only to re-elect the Medicare Hospice Benefit when expensive care is no
longer necessary. <a name="N_26_"></a></p>

<p>26. OIG investigations have revealed that certain hospices have falsified patient
medical records and plans of care to exaggerate the negative aspects regarding a hospice
patient's condition to justify reimbursement. <u>See</u> section II.A.3.b. and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_27_"></a></p>

<p>27. Each hospice is required to have an &quot;Interdisciplinary Group&quot; of
personnel. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2)(B). <u>See</u> note 16. Failure of the
Interdisciplinary Group to meet its responsibilities may result in substandard care. In
addition, inadequate review of a hospice patient may result in improper reimbursement for
services provided to a patient who fails to continue to be eligible for the Medicare
Hospice Benefit. <a name="N_28_"></a></p>

<p>28. Since the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Medicare Hospice
Benefit is divided into the following benefit periods: (1) initial 90-day; (2) subsequent
90-day; and (3) unlimited number of 60-day benefit periods as long as the patient
continues to meet program eligibility requirements. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395d. At the
beginning of each subsequent 60-day benefit period, the hospice physician must recertify
that the patient is terminally ill. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395f(a)(7). If the necessary
oversight is not performed during the unlimited periods of care, a hospice may receive
improper reimbursement for services provided to a patient who fails to continue to be
eligible for the Medicare Hospice Benefit. <a name="N_29_"></a></p>

<p>29. Examples of arrangements that may run afoul of the anti-kickback statute
include practices in which a hospice pays a fee to a physician for each certification of
terminal illness, or provides nursing, administrative, and other services for free or
below fair market value to physicians, nursing homes, hospitals and other potential
referral sources with the intent to influence referrals. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b; 60
FR 40847 (1995). <u>See also</u> discussion in section II.A.4. and accompanying notes. In
addition, a hospice that offers an incentive to an individual that such hospice knows or
should know is likely to influence the individual to use a particular hospice may be
subject to civil money penalties. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5). <a name="N_30_"></a></p>

<p>30. The OIG has observed instances of potential kickbacks between hospices and
nursing homes to unlawfully influence the referral of patients. In general, payments by a
hospice to a nursing home for &quot;room and board&quot; provided to a Medicaid hospice
patient should not exceed what the nursing home otherwise would have received directly
from Medicaid if the patient had not been enrolled in hospice. (If a patient receiving
Medicare hospice benefits in a nursing home is also eligible for Medicaid, Medicaid will
pay the hospice at least 95 percent of the State's daily nursing home rate, and the
hospice is then responsible for paying the nursing home for the patient's room and board.)
<u>See</u> Hospice Medicare Manual  204.2. <u>See also</u> section II.A.4. and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_31_"></a></p>

<p>31. There may be some overlap in the services that the nursing homes and hospices
provide, thereby providing one or the other the opportunity to reduce services and costs.
Recent OIG reports found that residents of certain nursing homes receive fewer services
from their hospice than patients who receive hospice services in their own homes. Upon
review, it was found that many nursing home hospice patients were receiving only basic
nursing and aide visits that were provided by nursing home staff as part of room and board
when hospice staff were not present. Other additional treatments provided by hospice
staff, such as nursing and aide visits, were often clearly within the professional skills
possessed by nursing home staff. The reports found that the nature of services provided by
hospice staff, while appropriate and efficacious, appeared to differ little from services
a nursing home would have provided if the patient was not enrolled in hospice. <u>See</u>
OEI report OEI-05-95-00250 - &quot;Hospice Patients in Nursing Homes;&quot; <u>see also</u>OIG
report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure Validity of Medicare
Hospice Enrollments.&quot; Since hospices receive a fixed daily payment regardless of the
number of services provided or the location of the patient, fewer services may result in
higher profits per patient. <u>See also</u> section II.A.3.e. and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_32_"></a></p>

<p>32. Certain of the hospice services (<u>i.e.</u>, &quot;core services&quot; such as
nursing, medical, social, and counseling services) must be provided directly to the
patient by employees of the hospice, while other non-core hospice services may be provided
at fair market value in accordance with contracts with other providers. However, the
hospice must retain professional management for all contracted services. <u>See</u> 42 CFR
418.80. <a name="N_33_"></a></p>

<p>33. A patient who resides in a skilled nursing facility or nursing facility may
elect the Medicare Hospice Benefit if: (1) the residential care is paid for by (a) the
beneficiary or private insurance, or (b) Medicaid (if the beneficiary is dual eligible); <u>and</u>
(2) the hospice and facility have a written agreement under which the hospice takes full
responsibility for the professional management of the individual's hospice care and the
facility agrees to provide room and board. Hospice Medicare Manual  204.2. <a
name="N_34_"></a></p>

<p>34. Billing for unnecessary services involves knowingly seeking reimbursement for
services that &quot;are not reasonable and necessary for the palliation or management of
terminal illness.&quot; <u>See</u>42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(1)(C). Because HCFA establishes
different payment amounts for specific categories of covered hospice care, a hospice must
ensure that it provides services to hospice patients that are reasonable and necessary.
Otherwise, the hospice may be reimbursed for a higher level of care than was necessary, <u>e.g.</u>,
a hospice that provides and bills for continuous care where only routine home care is
necessary. <u>See also</u> section II.A.3.d. and accompanying notes. <a name="N_35_"></a></p>

<p>35. Fiscal intermediaries have informed the OIG that hospices rarely offer the
reasons supporting the revocation of a patient's Medicare Hospice Benefit. Although a
hospice may discharge a patient if it discovers that the patient is not terminally ill,
hospices should not encourage a patient to revoke the benefit merely to avoid the
obligation to pay for hospice services that have become too costly. <u>See</u> 42 CFR
418.28; Hospice Medicare Manual  210. <a name="N_36_"></a></p>

<p>36. Medicare conditions of participation require that hospices and all hospice
employees must be licensed in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws and
regulations. 42 CFR 418.72. <a name="N_37_"></a></p>

<p>37. If additions or corrections need to be made to medical records, hospices should
make such entries according to standards of practice and applicable State law. For
example, hospices might correct a medical record by drawing a single line through the
erroneous entry, writing &quot;error&quot; next to the entry, initialing and dating the
correction and writing the correct information near the entry or writing where the correct
information could be found. <a name="N_38_"></a></p>

<p>38. Hospices should not utilize prohibited or inappropriate conduct (<u>e.g.</u>,
offer free gifts or services to patients), designed to maximize business growth and
patient retention, to carry out their initiatives and activities. Also, any marketing
information offered by hospices should be clear, correct, non-deceptive, and fully
informative. Through ORT, it was discovered that hospice marketing materials had placed
considerable emphasis on the availability of hospice benefits for long term care patients,
while downplaying or ignoring the terminal illness eligibility requirement. <u>See</u> OIG
report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure Validity of Medicare
Hospice Enrollments.&quot; Hospices should not engage in marketing and sales strategies
that offer incomplete or inadequate information about Medicare entitlement under the
Medicare Hospice Benefit to induce beneficiaries to elect hospice and thereby waive
aggressive treatment options that Medicare would otherwise cover. Marketing statements
should not create the perception that the initial terminal prognosis is of limited
importance and that hospice benefits may almost routinely be provided over an indefinite
time period. Marketing materials should prominently feature the eligibility requirements
for the Medicare Hospice Benefit. <a name="N_39_"></a></p>

<p>39. An example of an improper review of patient records is when a hospice arranges
with the administration of a nursing facility to review patient records without the
patients' permission, solely to determine if the patients are eligible for hospice care
and to solicit hospice referrals. Hospices should not review medical records of nursing
home patients in an attempt to recruit patients for hospice services based on their
diagnoses. For instance, <u>see</u> OIG report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls
Needed to Assure Validity of Medicare Hospice Enrollments.&quot; <a name="N_40_"></a></p>

<p>40. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33, amended the Social Security Act
so that hospices will no longer be required to routinely provide all physician services
directly by employing a physician. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2). Because the OIG has
received reports of limited involvement displayed by contracted physicians, as opposed to
hospice-employed physicians, hospices should consider having oversight mechanisms in place
to ensure that hospice physicians are thoroughly reviewing re-certification documentation.
<a name="N_41_"></a></p>

<p>41. Through ORT activities, it was discovered that hospice sales staff often were
paid on commission based on the length of a patient's stay in hospice. For example,
commission amounts were determined by multiplying the total number of days of hospice
patient care (patient days) within a sales representative's territory by a factor that
reflected the level of achievement of assigned sales performance objectives. Such
marketing tactics encouraged the recruitment of long-term patients, many of whom the
review found ineligible for the Medicare Hospice Benefit. The OIG recommends that hospices
monitor sales commissions for potential vulnerabilities associated with improper patient
recruiting. <u>See</u> OIG report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure
Validity of Medicare Hospice Enrollments.&quot; <a name="N_42_"></a></p>

<p>42. Hospices rely heavily on volunteer support. In fact, the Medicare Hospice
Benefit is the only Federally funded program that mandates the provision of volunteer
services. Appropriately, hospices need to recognize and attend to compliance issues
associated with volunteers (<u>i.e.</u>, screening, training, disciplining, monitoring,
etc.). <a name="N_43_"></a></p>

<p>43. Medicare payments for hospice services are made on a prospective basis and
adjusted by an area wage index. Hospices must submit claims based on the geographic
location at which the service is furnished and not the location of the hospice. Incorrect
designation of the place of service for revenue codes 651 and 652 of the hospice claim may
significantly alter reimbursement and result in overpayment for services performed (<u>e.g.</u>,
hospice office in a metropolitan area may be reimbursed more than a rural home where the
services were performed). <a name="N_44_"></a></p>

<p>44. Hospice staff must make an appropriate entry in the patient's medical record as
soon as they receive a verbal certification of terminal illness and file written
certifications in the medical record. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.22(d). State regulations may
require that verbal and telephone orders from physicians should only be accepted by
individuals authorized by State law to accept such orders. The OIG recommends that those
authorized individuals accepting verbal and telephone orders should record, date and sign
these orders and the physician(s) who ordered the service or treatment should countersign
them no later than the time period required by State regulations. <a name="N_45_"></a></p>

<p>45. We have received comments expressing concern over late hospice referrals by
physicians. While the onus of a timely hospice referral may be on a physician, a hospice
should identify untimely referrals and provide adequate follow-up to the physicians. When
hospice referrals are late, terminally ill patients may be unnecessarily denied access to
the Medicare Hospice Benefit, hospices may have to admit a patient at the costliest stage
of terminal illness, and quality of care may be affected because of patients being too far
along to receive the optimum benefits of hospice care. Hospices need to work closely with
physicians to educate and remind them as to the sensitivities and risks associated with
untimely referrals. The OIG supports appropriate efforts to increase access to hospice
care for eligible individuals. <a name="N_46_"></a></p>

<p>46. <u>E.g.</u>, transfer of a patient from one hospice to another hospice owned by
the same company to circumvent applicable reimbursement caps. <a name="N_47_"></a></p>

<p>47. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.50-418.100 for the Medicare conditions of participation
that apply to hospices. <a name="N_48_"></a></p>

<p>48. An overpayment is the amount of money a hospice may have received in excess of
the amount due and payable under a health care program. Examples of overpayments include,
but are not limited to, instances where a hospice is: (1) paid twice for the same service
either by Medicare or by Medicare and another insurer; or (2) paid for care rendered to
patients who are not terminally ill or are otherwise ineligible for the Medicare Hospice
Benefit. For instance, <u>see</u>Hospice Medicare Manual  307. The OIG strongly
recommends that the hospice institute procedures to detect overpayments and to promptly
remit such overpayments to the affected payor. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3), which
provides criminal penalties for failure to disclose an overpayment. <u>See also</u> 18
U.S.C. 669. <a name="N_49_"></a></p>

<p>49. &quot;Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an organization has
previously committed casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable steps to prevent such
misconduct&quot; and is a significant factor in the assessment of whether a compliance
program is effective. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines
Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(k)(iii). <a name="N_50_"></a></p>

<p>50. Each patient's clinical record must contain: (1) the initial and subsequent
assessments (including hospice admission history, certification, and recertification); (2)
the plan of care; (3) identification data; (4) consent and authorization and election
forms; (5) pertinent medical history; and (6) complete documentation of all services and
events (including evaluations, treatments, progress notes, etc.). <u>See</u> 42 CFR
418.74. <a name="N_51_"></a></p>

<p>51.The OIG has undertaken numerous audits, investigations, inspections, and
national enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing potential and actual fraud, abuse and
waste. For example, <u>see</u> OIG report A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed
to Assure Validity of Medicare Hospice Enrollments;&quot; <u>see also</u> OIG Special
Fraud Alert - &quot;Fraud and Abuse in Nursing Home Arrangements with Hospices&quot;
(March 1998); OIG Medicare Advisory Bulletin on Hospice Benefits (November 1995). <a
name="N_52_"></a></p>

<p>52. 42 U.S.C. 1395d(a) authorizes the reimbursement of hospice care. <a
name="N_53_"></a></p>

<p>53. An individual is considered to be &quot;terminally ill&quot; if the individual
has a medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is six months or less if the
illness runs its normal course. 42 CFR 418.3. However, the fact that a hospice patient
lives beyond this six month period, in and of itself, does not constitute grounds for a
determination that the patient was never eligible for hospice care, or that the services
provided to the patient were not reimbursable by Medicare. <a name="N_54_"></a></p>

<p>54. Medical reviews, audits, inspections, and investigations of hospices have
concluded that hospices have billed Medicare for hospice services provided to patients who
are not terminally ill. For instance, <u>see</u> OIG report OEI-04-93-00270 -
&quot;Medicare Hospice Beneficiaries: Services and Eligibility.&quot; Through Operation
Restore Trust activities and the increased program integrity actions by the Regional Home
Health Intermediaries (RHHIs), it was discovered that many beneficiaries receiving
Medicare hospice benefits did not have a terminal illness. In the review of hospice cases
between 1992 and 1996, patients did not demonstrate significant clinical symptoms of their
disease nor notable functional limitations one would expect to see in a person who has a
terminal illness as defined by Medicare. <u>See</u> OIG report A-05-96-00023 -
&quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure Validity of Medicare Hospice Enrollments.&quot;
Findings such as these have prompted a concern that some hospices may intentionally
misrepresent a condition as terminal in order to secure Medicare reimbursement. <u>See
also</u> note 23. <a name="N_55_"></a></p>

<p>55. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.22(d). If a question is raised as to whether a patient is
terminally ill, the hospice will be requested to furnish its Medicare fiscal intermediary
with the information necessary to establish that the patient is terminally ill. <a
name="N_56_"></a></p>

<p>56. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395f(a)(7). <u>See also</u> note 28. <a name="N_57_"></a></p>

<p>57. In order to verify a patient's terminal illness, Medicare fiscal intermediaries
need to review physician input and rationale beyond a signature on the certification form
(<u>e.g.</u>, a recent medical history and physical if the physician does not actually
examine the patient prior to admission to hospice; summary of physician review of the
history and physical taken by hospice personnel; or physician documentation of his or her
contribution to the Interdisciplinary Group meetings). <a name="N_58_"></a></p>

<p>58. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.62. <a name="N_59_"></a></p>

<p>59. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395f(a)(7); 42 CFR 418.58. <a name="N_60_"></a></p>

<p>60. <u>Id.</u><a name="N_61_"></a> </p>

<p>61. Some ORT audits found that hospice physicians, at times, rely partly on
referring, attending physicians. Although the referring physician's opinion can and should
be considered as part of the decision making process, the final determination of hospice
eligibility is the responsibility of the hospice physician. For instance, <u>see</u> OIG
report A-04-95-02111. If employees of a hospice believe that services ordered by a
physician are excessive or otherwise inappropriate, the hospice cannot avoid liability for
filing improper claims simply because a physician has certified the need for hospice care.
<a name="N_62_"></a></p>

<p>62. For Medicare reimbursement purposes, the services of the hospice medical
director(s) or the physician member of the Hospice Interdisciplinary Group must be
performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy. <u>See </u>42 CFR 418.202. The hospice
should employ reasonable measures to verify that physicians who establish the hospice plan
are appropriately licensed and no adverse actions, such as criminal conviction, debarment
or an exclusion, have been taken against them. <a name="N_63_"></a></p>

<p>63. 42 CFR 418.58(c). <a name="N_64_"></a></p>

<p>64. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395f(a)(7)(B); 42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2)(B). <a name="N_65_"></a></p>

<p>65. 42 CFR 418.58(b). <a name="N_66_"></a></p>

<p>66. Once a Medicare beneficiary elects hospice care, the hospice is responsible for
furnishing directly, or arranging for, all supplies and services that relate to the
beneficiary's terminal condition, except the services of an attending physician. Hospice
beneficiaries have the right to receive covered medical, social and emotional support
services from the hospice directly, or through arrangements made by the hospice, and
should not be forced to seek or pay for such care from non-hospice providers. <a
name="N_67_"></a></p>

<p>67. Interdisciplinary Group conferences are regularly scheduled periodic meetings
of the Interdisciplinary Group to review the most current patient/family assessment,
evaluate needs and update the plan of care. <a name="N_68_"></a></p>

<p>68. <u>See</u> note 34. <a name="N_69_"></a></p>

<p>69. Payment amounts are determined within each of the following categories: (1)
routine home care day; (2) continuous home care day (patient who receives hospice care
that consists predominantly of nursing care on a continuous basis at home, is furnished
only during brief periods of crisis and only as necessary to maintain the terminally ill
patient at home); (3) inpatient respite care day (hospice patient receives care in an
approved facility on a short-term basis for respite -- not more than five consecutive days
at a time); and (4) general inpatient care day (hospice patient receives general inpatient
care in an inpatient facility for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that
cannot be managed in other settings). <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.302. <a name="N_70_"></a></p>

<p>70. Administrative civil money penalties, assessments, and exclusion, as well as
remedies available under criminal and civil law, including the civil False Claims Act, may
be imposed against any person who submits a claim for services &quot;that [the] person
knows or should know are not medically necessary.&quot; <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 42 U.S.C.
1320a-7a(a). <a name="N_71_"></a></p>

<p>71. Medicare fiscal intermediaries have the authority to require hospices that
furnish items or services under the program to submit documentation that substantiates
services were actually provided and medically necessary. <u>See</u> Medicare Intermediary
Manual  3116.1.B. <a name="N_72_"></a></p>

<p>72. <u>See</u> note 69. <a name="N_73_"></a></p>

<p>73. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.66. <a name="N_74_"></a></p>

<p>74. <u>See</u> note 33. <a name="N_75_"></a></p>

<p>75. In some cases reviewed in nursing homes, OIG medical reviewers have found that
while the hospice benefit may eventually have been appropriate, at the time of election,
patients were stable and the election of hospice was premature. <u>See</u> OEI report
OEI-05-95-00250: &quot;Hospice Patients in Nursing Homes;&quot; <u>see also</u> OIG report
A-05-96-00023 - &quot;Enhanced Controls Needed to Assure Validity of Medicare Hospice
Enrollments.&quot; For other examples of potential fraud and abuse in the hospice/nursing
home context, <u>see</u> notes 30-33. <a name="N_76_"></a></p>

<p>76. Hospice Certification Manual  2082.B. <a name="N_77_"></a></p>

<p>77. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.50. <a name="N_78_"></a></p>

<p>78. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.56. <a name="N_79_"></a></p>

<p>79. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.58. <a name="N_80_"></a></p>

<p>80. Hospice Certification Manual  2082.A. <a name="N_81_"></a></p>

<p>81. Hospice Certification Manual  2082.A. <a name="N_82_"></a></p>

<p>82. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.80. <a name="N_83_"></a></p>

<p>83. In limited circumstances, HCFA may approve a waiver of the requirement for core
nursing services to be provided by a hospice that is located in a non-urbanized area. <u>See</u>
42 CFR 418.83. <a name="N_84_"></a></p>

<p>84. A hospice may consider creating some type of payroll tracking or time study in
an effort to properly differentiate services between the hospice and the nursing home. <a
name="N_85_"></a></p>

<p>85. The hospice's in-house counsel or compliance officer should, among other
things, obtain copies of all relevant OIG regulations, Special Fraud Alerts and advisory
opinions (these documents are located on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig),
and ensure that the hospice's policies reflect the guidance provided by the OIG. <a
name="N_86_"></a></p>

<p>86. Although hospices may contract with physicians, <u>see</u> note 40, hospices
and physicians must still tailor such agreements to avoid violation of the anti-kickback
statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulation and to comply with applicable
Medicare conditions of participation. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.56 and 418.86. <a name="N_87_"></a></p>

<p>87. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b); 60 FR 40847 (1995). <a name="N_88_"></a></p>

<p>88. While an exclusive or semi-exclusive arrangement with a nursing home to provide
hospice services to residents can promote efficiency and safety by permitting the nursing
home operator to coordinate care, screen hospice caregivers, and maintain control of the
premises, such an arrangement may have substantial monetary value to a hospice. In these
circumstances, some nursing home operators and/or hospices may request or offer illegal
remuneration to influence a nursing home's decision to do business with a particular
hospice. <a name="N_89_"></a></p>

<p>89. First, a nursing home's population represents a sizeable pool of potential
hospice patients. Second, nursing home hospice patients may generate higher gross revenues
per patient than patients residing in their own homes, because nursing home residents
receiving hospice care have, on average, longer lengths of stay than hospice patients
residing in their own homes. <a name="N_90_"></a></p>

<p>90. <u>See</u> note 30. <a name="N_91_"></a></p>

<p>91. <u>See</u> OIG Special Fraud Alert - &quot;Fraud and Abuse in Nursing Home
Arrangements with Hospices&quot; (March 1998). <a name="N_92_"></a></p>

<p>92. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 1001.952. <a name="N_93_"></a></p>

<p>93. This records system should be tailored to fit the individual needs and
financial resources of the hospice. <a name="N_94_"></a></p>

<p>94. For example, Medicare requires that hospices must establish and maintain a
clinical record for every individual receiving care and services. The record must be
complete, promptly and accurately documented, readily accessible and systematically
organized to facilitate retrieval. Any entries are to be made and signed by the person
providing the services. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 418.74. <a name="N_95_"></a></p>

<p>95. The creation and retention of such documents and reports may raise a variety of
legal issues, such as patient privacy and confidentiality. These issues are best discussed
with legal counsel. <a name="N_96_"></a></p>

<p>96. The OIG believes that it is not advisable for the compliance function to be
subordinate to the hospice's general counsel, or comptroller or similar hospice financial
officer. Free standing compliance functions help to ensure independent and objective legal
reviews and financial analyses of the institution's compliance efforts and activities. By
separating the compliance function from the key management positions of general counsel or
chief financial officer (where the size and structure of the hospice make this a feasible
option), a system of checks and balances is established to more effectively achieve the
goals of the compliance program. <a name="N_97_"></a></p>

<p>97. For multi-hospice organizations or hospital-owned hospices, the OIG encourages
coordination with each hospice owned by the corporation or hospital through the use of a
headquarter's compliance officer, communicating with parallel positions in each facility,
regional office or business line, as appropriate. <a name="N_98_"></a></p>

<p>98. The National Practitioner Data Bank is a data base that contains information
about medical malpractice payments, sanctions by boards of medical examiners or State
licensing boards, adverse clinical privilege actions and adverse professional society
membership actions. Health care entities can have access to this data base to seek
information about their own medical or clinical staff, as well as prospective employees or
physician contractors. <a name="N_99_"></a></p>

<p>99. The List of Excluded Individuals/Entities is an OIG-produced report available
on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. It is updated on a regular basis to
reflect the status of health care providers who have been excluded from participation in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the General Services Administration
maintains a monthly listing of debarred contractors on the Internet at
http://epls.arnet.gov/. <a name="N_100_"></a></p>

<p>100. The compliance officer may also have to ensure that the criminal backgrounds
of employees have been checked depending upon State requirements or hospice policy. <u>See</u>
note 131. <a name="N_101_"></a></p>

<p>101. Periodic on-site visits of hospice operations, bulletins with compliance
updates and reminders, distribution of audiotapes or videotapes on different risk areas,
lectures at management and employee meetings, circulation of recent health care articles
covering fraud and abuse, and innovative changes to compliance training are various
examples of approaches and techniques the compliance officer can employ for the purpose of
ensuring continued interest in the compliance program and the hospice's commitment to its
policies and principles. <a name="N_102_"></a></p>

<p>102. The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals
with varying responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, finance, audit,
human resources, and clinical management (<u>e.g.</u>, hospice physician), as well as
employees and managers of key operating units. These individuals should have the requisite
seniority and comprehensive experience within their respective departments to implement
any necessary changes to hospice policies and procedures as recommended by the committee. <a
name="N_103_"></a></p>

<p>103. A health care provider should expect its compliance committee members and
compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness, and an
approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the hospice
and having significant professional experience working with billing, clinical records,
documentation, and auditing principles. <a name="N_104_"></a></p>

<p>104. Specific compliance training should complement any &quot;inservice&quot;
training sessions that a hospice may regularly schedule to provide an ongoing program for
the training of employees as required by its conditions of participation. 42 CFR 418.64. <a
name="N_105_"></a></p>

<p>105. Some publications, such as OIG's Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection
reports, and advisory opinions, as well as the annual OIG work plan, are readily available
from the OIG and could be the basis for standards, educational courses, and programs for
appropriate hospice employees. <a name="N_106_"></a></p>

<p>106. Significant variations in the functions and responsibilities of different
departments or groups may create the need for training materials that are tailored to
compliance concerns associated with particular operations and duties. <a name="N_107_"></a></p>

<p>107. Certain positions, such as those that involve the billing of hospice services
or patient admission to hospice care, create a greater organizational legal exposure, and
therefore require specialized training. <a name="N_108_"></a></p>

<p>108. Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and
employee comprehension of the hospice's policies and procedures. <a name="N_109_"></a></p>

<p>109. This practice involves the hospice altering the attending physician's or other
authorized physician's diagnosis in order to receive reimbursement for hospice care. A
hospice should not claim the patient has a particular medical condition in order to
qualify for reimbursement for which it would not otherwise qualify. <a name="N_110_"></a></p>

<p>110. In addition, where feasible, the OIG recommends that a hospice afford outside
contractors the opportunity to participate in the hospice's compliance training and
educational programs, or develop their own programs that complement the hospice's
standards of conduct, compliance requirements, and other rules and practices. <a
name="N_111_"></a></p>

<p>111. Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of corporate integrity
agreements that require many of these training elements. The OIG usually requires a
minimum of one to three hours annually for basic training in compliance areas. Additional
training is required for specialty fields such as billing and marketing. <a name="N_112_"></a></p>

<p>112. If videos are utilized for compliance training, the OIG suggests that a
hospice make an individual available to field questions from video trainees. In addition,
those hospices that use video training should strongly consider requiring trainees to
complete post training comprehension tests to ensure that trainees actively paid attention
to the video. <a name="N_113_"></a></p>

<p>113. The OIG believes that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation,
a concept embodied in the provisions of the False Claims Act. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C.
3730(h). In many cases, employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u>
<u>tam </u>provisions out of frustration because of the company's failure to take action
when a questionable, fraudulent, or abusive situation was brought to the attention of
senior corporate officials. <a name="N_114_"></a></p>

<p>114. Hospices can also consider rewarding employees for appropriate use of
established reporting systems. <a name="N_115_"></a></p>

<p>115. The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a smaller
hospice to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls about compliance
issues. These companies may want to explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>, outsourcing
the hotline or establishing a written method of confidential disclosure. <a name="N_116_"></a></p>

<p>116. In addition to methods of communication used by current employees, an
effective employee exit interview program could be designed to solicit information from
departing employees regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations of hospice
policy and procedures. <a name="N_117_"></a></p>

<p>117. Hospices should also post in a prominent, available area the HHS-OIG Hotline
telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800-HHS-TIPS), in addition to any company hotline
number that may be posted. <a name="N_118_"></a></p>

<p>118. To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the hospice should
create an intake form for all compliance issues identified through reporting mechanisms.
The form could include information concerning the date that the potential problem was
reported, the internal investigative methods utilized, the results of the investigation,
the corrective action implemented, the disciplinary measures imposed, and any identified
overpayments and monies returned. <a name="N_119_"></a></p>

<p>119. Information obtained over the hotline may provide valuable insight into
management practices and operations, whether reported problems are actual or perceived. <a
name="N_120_"></a></p>

<p>120. Even when a hospice or group of hospices is owned by a larger corporate
entity, the regular auditing and monitoring of the compliance activities of an individual
hospice must be a key feature in any annual review. Appropriate reports on audit findings
should be periodically provided and explained to a parent organization's senior staff and
officers. <a name="N_121_"></a></p>

<p>121. <u>See also</u> section II.A.2. <a name="N_122_"></a></p>

<p>122. The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a hospice,
the compliance officer, with the assistance of department managers, should take a
&quot;snapshot&quot; of their operations from a compliance perspective. This assessment
can be undertaken by outside consultants, law or accounting firms, or internal staff, with
authoritative knowledge of health care compliance requirements. This &quot;snapshot,&quot;
often used as part of benchmarking analyses, becomes a baseline for the compliance officer
and other managers to judge the hospice's progress in reducing or eliminating potential
areas of vulnerability. <a name="N_123_"></a></p>

<p>123. In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section G.2, below, reports of
fraud or systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate governmental authority. <a
name="N_124_"></a></p>

<p>124. One way to assess the knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of the hospice's
employees is through the use of a validated survey instrument (<u>e.g.</u>, employee
questionnaires, interviews, or focus groups). <a name="N_125_"></a></p>

<p>125. Such records should include, but not be limited to, logs of hotline calls,
logs of training attendees, training agenda materials, and summaries of corrective action
taken and improvements made to hospice policies as a result of compliance activities. <a
name="N_126_"></a></p>

<p>126. <u>See</u> section II.A.3.e. <a name="N_127_"></a></p>

<p>127. The OIG recognizes that hospices that are small in size and have limited
resources may not be able to use internal reviewers who are not part of line management or
hire outside reviewers. <a name="N_128_"></a></p>

<p>128. 42 CFR 418.66. <a name="N_129_"></a></p>

<p>129. <u>Id.</u><a name="N_130_"></a> </p>

<p>130. <u>See</u> note 99. <a name="N_131_"></a></p>

<p>131. States may mandate, and many hospices voluntarily conduct, criminal background
checks for prospective employees of hospices. Identification of a criminal background of
an applicant, who may have been recently convicted of serious crimes that relate to the
proposed employment duties, could be grounds for denying employment. Further, criminal
background screening may deter those individuals with criminal intent from entering the
field of hospice. <a name="N_132_"></a></p>

<p>132. Because providers of hospice care have frequent, relatively unsupervised
access to potentially vulnerable people and their property, a hospice should also strictly
scrutinize whether it should employ individuals who have been convicted of crimes of
neglect, violence, theft or dishonesty, or financial misconduct. <a name="N_133_"></a></p>

<p>133. Likewise, hospice compliance programs should establish standards prohibiting
the execution of contracts with companies that have been recently convicted of a criminal
offense related to health care or that are listed by a Federal agency as debarred,
excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs. <u>See</u>
note 99. <a name="N_134_"></a></p>

<p>134. Prospective employees who have been officially reinstated into the Medicare
and Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof of such
reinstatement. <a name="N_135_"></a></p>

<p>135. Instances of noncompliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
existence, or amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely
determinative of whether or not the conduct should be investigated and reported to
governmental authorities. In fact, there may be instances where there is no readily
identifiable monetary loss at all, but corrective action and reporting are still necessary
to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries, <u>e.g.</u>,
where services required by a plan of care were not provided. <a name="N_136_"></a></p>

<p>136. Advice from the hospice's in-house counsel or an outside law firm may be
sought to determine the extent of the hospice's liability and to plan the appropriate
course of action. <a name="N_137_"></a></p>

<p>137. The OIG currently maintains a provider self-disclosure protocol that
encourages providers to report suspected fraud. The concept of voluntary self-disclosure
is premised on a recognition that the Government alone cannot protect the integrity of the
Medicare and other Federal health care programs. Health care providers must be willing to
police themselves, correct underlying problems and work with the Government to resolve
these matters. The self-disclosure protocol can be located on the OIG's website at
http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig <a name="N_138_"></a></p>

<p>138. The parameters of a claim review subject to an internal investigation will
depend on the circumstances surrounding the issue(s) identified. By limiting the scope of
an internal audit to current billing, a hospice may fail to discover major problems and
deficiencies in operations, as well as be subject to certain liability. <a name="N_139_"></a></p>

<p>139. Appropriate Federal and State authorities include the Office of Inspector
General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Criminal and Civil Divisions
of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney in relevant districts, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the other investigative arms for the agencies administering the
affected Federal or State health care programs, such as the State Medicaid Fraud Control
Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and
the Office of Personnel Management (which administers the Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program). <a name="N_140_"></a></p>

<p>140. In contrast, to qualify for the &quot;not less than double damages&quot;
provision of the False Claims Act, the report must be provided to the Government within 30
days after the date when the hospice first obtained the information. 31 U.S.C. 3729(a). <a
name="N_141_"></a></p>

<p>141. The OIG believes that some violations may be so serious that they warrant
immediate notification to governmental authorities, prior to, or simultaneous with,
commencing an internal investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, if the conduct: (1) is a clear
violation of civil fraud or criminal law; (2) has a significant adverse effect on the
quality of care provided to program beneficiaries (in addition to any other legal
obligations regarding quality of care); or (3) indicates evidence of a systemic failure to
comply with applicable laws or an existing corporate integrity agreement, regardless of
the financial impact on Federal health care programs. <a name="N_142_"></a></p>

<p>142. The OIG has published criteria setting forth those factors that the OIG takes
into consideration in determining whether it is appropriate to exclude a health care
provider from program participation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7) for violations of
various fraud and abuse laws. <u>See</u> 62 FR 67392 (December 24, 1997). <a name="N_143_"></a></p>

<p>143. <u>See</u> note 139. <a name="N_144_"></a></p>

<p>144. A hospice should consult with its Medicare fiscal intermediary or HCFA for any
further guidance regarding normal repayment channels. The hospice's Medicare fiscal
intermediary or HCFA may require certain information (<u>e.g.</u>, alleged violation or
issue causing overpayment, description of the internal investigative process with
methodologies used to determine any overpayments, disciplinary actions taken and
corrective actions taken, etc.) to be submitted with return of any overpayments, and that
such repayment information be submitted to a specific department or individual. Interest
will be assessed, when appropriate. <u>See</u> 42 CFR 405.376. <a name="N_145_"></a></p>

<p>145. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3). <a name="N_146_"></a></p>

<p>146. Evaluation may be accomplished through techniques such as employee surveys, 
  management assessments and periodic review of benchmarks established for audits, 
  investigations, disciplinary action, overpayments and employee feedback. All 
  elements of an organization's compliance program can be evaluated, including 
  policies, training, practices and compliance personnel. </p>
