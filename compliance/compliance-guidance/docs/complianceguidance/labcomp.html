<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><a name="I. INTRODUCTION"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong>
</a><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
continues in its efforts to promote voluntarily developed and implemented compliance
programs for the health care industry. The following compliance program guidance is
intended to assist clinical laboratories in developing effective internal controls that
promote adherence to applicable federal and state law, and the program requirements of
federal, state, and private health plans.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The adoption
and implementation of voluntary compliance programs significantly advance the prevention
of fraud, abuse, and waste in the clinical laboratory industry while at the same time
further the fundamental mission of all health care providers, which is to provide quality
services and care to patients. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Within this document, the OIG intends to provide first, its general views on the value and
fundamental principles of clinical laboratory compliance programs, and second, specific
elements that each clinical laboratory should consider when developing and implementing an
effective compliance program. While this document presents basic procedural and structural
guidance for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself a compliance program.
Rather, it is a set of guidelines for consideration by a clinical laboratory interested in
implementing a compliance program. The recommendations and guidelines provided in this
document must be considered depending upon their applicability to each particular clinical
laboratory. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to
establish a culture within a clinical laboratory that promotes prevention, detection and
resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law, and
federal, state and private payor health care program requirements, as well as the clinical
laboratory's ethical and business policies. In practice, the compliance program should
effectively articulate and demonstrate the organization's commitment to the compliance
process. The existence of benchmarks that demonstrate implementation and achievements are
essential to any effective compliance program. Eventually, a compliance program should
become part of the fabric of routine clinical laboratory operations. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Specifically, compliance programs guide a clinical laboratory's governing body (<u>e.g.</u>,
Board of Directors), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), managers, technicians, billing
personnel, and other employees in the efficient management and operation of a clinical
laboratory. These employees are especially critical as an internal control in the
reimbursement and payment areas, where claims and billing operations are often the source
of fraud and abuse and, therefore, historically have been the focus of Government
regulation, scrutiny and sanctions. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
It is incumbent upon a clinical laboratory's corporate officers and managers to provide
ethical leadership to the organization and to assure that adequate systems are in place to
facilitate ethical and legal conduct. Indeed, many clinical laboratories and clinical
laboratory organizations have adopted mission statements articulating their commitment to
high ethical standards. A formal compliance program, as an additional element in this
process, offers a clinical laboratory a further concrete method that may improve quality
of services and reduce waste. Compliance programs also provide a central coordinating
mechanism for furnishing and disseminating information and guidance on applicable
statutes, regulations and other requirements of federal, state and private health plans. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Adopting and implementing an effective compliance program requires a substantial
commitment of time, energy and resources by senior management and the clinical
laboratory's governing body.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Programs hastily
constructed and implemented without appropriate ongoing monitoring will likely be
ineffective. While it may require significant additional resources or reallocation of
existing resources to implement an effective compliance program, the OIG believes that the
long term benefits of implementing the program outweigh the costs. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><br wp="br2">
<a name="A. BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM"><u><strong>A. BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE
PROGRAM</strong></u> </a></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">In addition to fulfilling its legal duty to ensure
that it is not submitting false or incorrect claims to Government and private payors, a
clinical laboratory may gain numerous additional benefits by implementing an effective
compliance program. Such programs make good business sense in that they help a clinical
laboratory fulfill its fundamental mission of providing quality services as well as
assisting clinical laboratories in identifying weaknesses in internal systems and
management. Other important potential benefits include the ability to: </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">concretely demonstrate to employees and the community at large the
    clinical laboratory's strong commitment to honest and responsible corporate conduct;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">provide a more accurate view of employee behavior relating to
    fraud and abuse;<br wp="br2">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">identify and prevent criminal and unethical conduct;<br wp="br1">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">improve the quality, efficiency and consistency of services;<br
    wp="br2">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">create a centralized source for distributing information on health
    care statutes, regulations and other program directives related to fraud and abuse and
    related issues;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">develop a methodology that encourages employees to report
    potential problems;<br wp="br2">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">develop procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation
    of alleged misconduct by corporate officers, managers and other employees;<br wp="br2">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">initiate immediate, appropriate, and decisive corrective action;
    and <br wp="br2">
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">through early detection and reporting, minimize the loss to the
    Government from false claims, and thereby reduce the clinical laboratory's exposure to
    civil damages and penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, such as
    program exclusion.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080">Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is
a sound investment on the part of a clinical laboratory. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG recognizes that the implementation of a compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud, abuse and waste from the clinical laboratory system. However, a sincere
effort by clinical laboratories to comply with applicable federal and state standards, as
well as the requirements of private health care programs, through the establishment of an
effective compliance program, significantly reduces the risk of unlawful or improper
conduct. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><a
name="B. APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE"><u><strong>B. APPLICATION OF
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</strong></u> </a><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
There is no single &quot;best&quot; clinical laboratory compliance program, given the
diversity of laboratories within the industry. The OIG understands the variances and
complexities within the clinical laboratory industry and is sensitive to the differences
among large and small clinical laboratories. However, elements of this guidance can be
used by all clinical laboratories, regardless of size, location or corporate structure, to
establish an effective compliance program. We recognize that some clinical laboratories
may not be able to adopt certain elements to the same comprehensive degree that others
with more extensive resources may achieve. This guidance represents the OIG's suggestions
on how a clinical laboratory can best establish internal controls and monitoring to
correct and prevent fraudulent activities. By no means should the contents of this
guidance be viewed as an exclusive discussion of the advisable elements of a compliance
program. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
In drafting this guidance, we took into consideration the Model Compliance Plan for
Clinical Laboratories issued by the OIG in February 1997, the clinical laboratory
industry's comments on that plan, changes in HCFA policy and the OIG's Compliance Program
Guidance for Hospitals. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
As appropriate, this guidance may be further modified and expanded as more information and
knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the rules, policies and procedures of
the federal, state and private health plans occur. We recognize that clinical laboratories
are already accountable for complying with an extensive set of statutory and other legal
requirements, far more specific and complex than what we have referenced in this document.
We also recognize that the development and implementation of compliance programs in
clinical laboratories often raise sensitive and complex legal and managerial issues.<a
href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is
critical guidance for providers who are sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant
health care statutes, regulations and other requirements of federal, state and private
health plans. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS"><u><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong></u>
</a><br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The elements proposed by these guidelines are
similar to those of the compliance program guidance for hospitals that was published by
the OIG in February 1998 and of our corporate integrity agreements.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
The elements represent a guide -- a process that can be used by clinical laboratories,
whether an independent national laboratory, a hospital laboratory, or a small, regional
laboratory. Moreover, the elements can be incorporated into the managerial structure of
the clinical laboratory. As we stated in our compliance program guidance for hospitals,
these suggested guidelines can be tailored to fit the needs and financial realities of a
particular laboratory. The OIG is cognizant that with regard to compliance programs, one
model is not suitable to every clinical laboratory. Nonetheless, the OIG believes that
every clinical laboratory, regardless of size or structure, can benefit from the
principles espoused in this guidance. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The OIG believes that every effective compliance program must
begin with a formal commitment by the clinical laboratory's governing body to include <u>all</u>
of the applicable elements listed below. These elements are based on the seven steps of
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> We recognize that
full implementation of all elements may not be immediately feasible for all clinical
laboratories. However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful commitment on the part
of the clinical laboratory will substantially contribute to a program's successful
implementation. <br>
<br wp="br1">
At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include the following seven
elements: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
(1) the development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as written
policies and procedures that promote the clinical laboratory's commitment to compliance (<u>e.g.</u>,
by including adherence to compliance as an element in evaluating managers and employees)
and that address specific areas of potential fraud, such as marketing schemes, CPT/HCPCs
coding issues, improper ICD-9 coding, and improper claims submission; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
(2) the designation of a chief compliance officer and other appropriate bodies <u>(e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee) charged with the responsibility of operating and
monitoring the compliance program, and who report directly to the CEO and the governing
body; </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><br wp="br1">
(3) the development and implementation of regular, effective education and training
programs for all affected employees; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
(4) the maintenance of a process, such as a hotline, to receive complaints, and the
adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of complainants and to protect
whistleblowers from retaliation; <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">(5) the development of a system to respond to allegations of
improper/illegal activities and the enforcement of appropriate disciplinary action against
employees who have violated internal compliance policies, applicable statutes, regulations
or requirements of federal, state or private health plans; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
(6) the use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist
in the reduction of identified problem areas; and <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
(7) the investigation and remediation of identified systemic problems and the development
of policies addressing the non-employment or retention of sanctioned individuals. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><br wp="br2">
<a name="A. WRITTEN PROCEDURES AND POLICIES"><u><strong>A. WRITTEN PROCEDURES AND POLICIES</strong></u>
</a><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Laboratory compliance programs should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies. These policies should be developed under the supervision and
direction of the chief compliance officer or the equivalent and should, at a minimum, be
provided to all individuals who are affected by the specific policy at issue. One
convenient method of achieving this goal is to create a three-ring compliance policy
notebook. This format permits the filing of new and amended or revised compliance policies
and ensures that affected individuals have easy access to the laboratory's written
policies. A master index should show when policies are changed. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="1. Standards of Conduct"><strong>1. Standards of Conduct</strong> </a><br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Laboratories should develop standards of conduct for all employees that clearly delineate
the policies of the laboratory with regard to fraud, waste and abuse and adherence to all
statutes, regulations and other program requirements governing federal, state and private
health benefit plans. These standards should be made available to all employees;
translated, interpreted (<u>e.g</u>., may be signed for hard of hearing or deaf employees)
or put into Braille as necessary, and regularly updated as the policies and regulations
are modified. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
When an employee first begins working for the clinical laboratory, and each time new
standards of conduct are issued, employees should be asked to sign a statement certifying
that they have received, read, and understood the standards of conduct. All employee
certifications should be retained by the laboratory. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong><a name="2. Medical Necessit">2. Medical Necessit</a>y</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Laboratory compliance programs, to be effective, should communicate to physicians that
claims submitted for services will only be paid if the service is covered, reasonable, and
necessary for the beneficiary, given his or her clinical condition. Laboratories should
take all reasonable steps to ensure that it is not submitting claims for services that are
not covered, reasonable and necessary.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a><strong> </strong>Upon
request, a laboratory should be able to produce or obtain from the treating physician
(test ordering), authorized person on the physician's staff or other individual authorized
by law to order tests the documentation to support the medical necessity of the service
the laboratory has provided and billed to a federal or private health care program. We
recognize that laboratories do not and cannot treat patients or make medical necessity
determinations. However, there are steps that such facilities can take to assure
compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations and the requirements of federal,
state and private health plans. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
As a preliminary matter, the OIG recognizes that physicians or other authorized
individuals must be able to order any tests that they believe are appropriate for the
treatment of their patients. However, we believe that physicians must be made aware by the
billing laboratory that Medicare will only pay for tests that meet the Medicare coverage
criteria and are reasonable and necessary to treat or diagnose an individual patient.
Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act states, &quot;no payment may be made
under Part A or Part B for any expenses incurred for items or services which...are not
reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to
improve the functioning of a malformed body member.&quot; Therefore, Medicare may deny
payment for a test that the physician believes is appropriate, but which does not meet the
Medicare coverage criteria (<u>e.g.</u>, done for screening purposes) or where
documentation in the entire patient record, including that maintained in the physician's
records, does not support that the tests were reasonable and necessary for a given
patient. Laboratories can and should advise their clients that tests submitted for
Medicare reimbursement must meet program requirements<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> or
the claim may be denied. <br>
<br>
Laboratories may implement the following steps through their compliance programs or some
other appropriate mechanism to ensure that the claims they submit to federal or private
health care programs meet the appropriate program requirements: <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="a. Requisition Design:">a. <u>Requisition Design</u>:</a>
While HCFA does not design or approve requisition forms, laboratories should construct the
requisition form to capture the correct program information as required by federal or
private health care programs and to promote the conscious ordering of tests by physicians
or other authorized individuals. The laboratory should construct the requisition form to
ensure that the physician or other authorized individual has made an independent medical
necessity decision with regard to each test the laboratory will bill. Laboratories should
encourage physicians or other authorized individuals to submit diagnosis information for
all tests ordered, as documentation of the medical necessity of the service. The form
should contain a statement indicating that Medicare generally does not cover routine
screening tests. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="b. Notices to Physicians:">b. <u>Notices to Physicians</u>:</a> While HCFA does
not impose educational requirements upon the laboratories, labs are in a unique position
to educate their physician clients. Therefore, laboratories should provide all of their
physician clients with annual written notices that set forth: (1) the Medicare national
policy and Medicare contractor local medical review policy for lab tests; (2) that organ
or disease related panels will only be paid and will only be billed when all components
are medically necessary; and (3) the Medicare laboratory fee schedule and a statement
informing the physician that the Medicaid reimbursement amount will be equal to or less
than the amount of Medicare reimbursement. The notice must also provide the phone number
of the clinical consultant. The clinical consultant is required under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification (42 CFR §493.1453). <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
In addition to the general notices above, laboratories that continue to offer clients the
opportunity to request customized profiles should provide annual written notices that: (1)
explain the Medicare reimbursement paid for each component of each such profile; (2)
inform physicians that using a customized profile may result in the ordering of tests
which are not covered, reasonable or necessary and that tests will not be billed;<a
href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> and (3) inform physicians that the OIG takes the position
that an individual who knowingly causes a false claim to be submitted may be subject to
sanctions or remedies available under civil, criminal and administrative law. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="c. Physician Acknowledgments">c. <u>Physician Acknowledgments</u></a>: Although
HCFA does not require physicians to sign acknowledgments, laboratories should have the
physician sign an acknowledgment stating he or she understands the potential implications
of ordering customized profiles. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="d. Use of Advance Beneficiary Notices (ABNs):">d. <u>Use
of Advance Beneficiary Notices (ABNs)</u>:</a> Advance Beneficiary Notices are used when
there is a likelihood that an ordered service will not be paid. Before the service is
furnished, the beneficiary should be notified, in writing, of the likelihood that the
specific service will be denied. After being so informed the beneficiary has the choice to
either (1) decide to receive the service and sign the agreement to pay on the ABN or (2)
decide not to receive the service and therefore does not sign the ABN. Beneficiaries
should not be asked to sign blank ABNs. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
As the entity furnishing and billing for services, it is ultimately the laboratory's
responsibility to produce the ABN, upon request. In many cases, it is difficult for the
laboratories to directly obtain an ABN from the beneficiary. Therefore, laboratories may
wish to educate physicians on the appropriate use of ABNs. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The notice must be in writing, must clearly identify a particular service, must state that
payment for the particular service likely will be denied and must give the reason(s) for
the belief that payment is likely to be denied. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Routine notices to beneficiaries which do no more than state that denial of payment is
possible or that they never know whether payment will be denied are not considered
acceptable evidence of advance notice. Notices should not be given to beneficiaries unless
there is some genuine doubt regarding the likelihood of payment as evidenced by the
reasons stated on the ABN. Giving notice for all claims or services is not an acceptable
practice. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="e. Test Utilization Monitoring:">e. <u>Test Utilization
Monitoring</u>: </a>The OIG believes that laboratories can and should take the steps
described in this compliance guidance to help ensure appropriate billing of lab tests. We
also believe that there are steps laboratories can take to determine whether physicians or
other individuals authorized to order tests are being encouraged to order medically
unnecessary tests. More importantly, if the laboratory discovers that it has in some way
contributed to the ordering of unnecessary tests, the OIG believes the laboratory has a
duty to modify its practices, as well as notify the physician(s) or other authorized
individual(s) of its concerns and recommend corrective action. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
There are many methods by which a laboratory may determine excessive utilization of
laboratory services. One approach to self-monitoring is to hire an outside consultant to
analyze the laboratory's patterns of utilization, and investigate any potential problems
or aberrancies. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Another approach is to analyze test utilization data by CPT or HCPCS code, for the top 30
tests performed each year. Laboratories could do this by keeping track of the number of
tests performed by CPT or HCPCS code or of the number of claims submitted for each test.
The laboratories would then compute the percentage growth in the number of tests or claims
submitted for each of the top 30 tests from one year to the next. We believe that if a
test's utilization grows more than 10 percent, the laboratory should undertake a
reasonable inquiry to ascertain the cause of such growth. If the laboratory determines
that the increase in test utilization occurred for a benign reason, such as the
acquisition of a new laboratory facility, then the laboratory need not take any action.
However, if the laboratory determines that the increase in utilization was caused by a
misunderstanding or ignorance by the ordering physicians or other authorized individuals
regarding the billing consequences of the tests they ordered or an action on the part of
the facility, the laboratory should take any steps that it deems reasonably necessary to
address the issue and to ensure misconduct is not occurring. </font></p>

<br wp="br2">
Laboratory compliance policies should ensure that all claims for testing services
submitted to Medicare or other federal health care programs correctly identify the
services ordered by the physician or other authorized individual and performed by the
laboratory. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="a. Selection of CPT or HCPCS Codes:">a. <u>Selection of CPT or HCPCS Codes</u>:</a>
Laboratory compliance policies should ensure that the CPT or HCPCS code that is used to
bill, accurately describes the service that was ordered and performed. Laboratories cannot
alter the physician's order in any way either increasing or decreasing the number of
services performed without the express consent of the ordering physician or other
authorized individual. To ensure code accuracy, laboratories should require that
individuals with technical expertise in laboratory testing review the appropriateness of
the codes before the claims are submitted. Intentional or knowing upcoding (<u>i.e.</u>,
the selection of a code to maximize reimbursement when such code is not the most
appropriate descriptor of the service) could violate the False Claims Act and/or other
civil laws, and criminal law. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="b. Selection of ICD-9-CM Codes">b. <u>Selection of ICD-9-CM Codes</u></a>:
Medicare carriers and fiscal intermediaries have the authority to develop and implement
Local Medical Review Policy (LMRP) which specify when, and under what circumstances, a
service will be considered covered, reasonable and necessary and what documentation will
support the need for the service. In some cases, LMRPs may limit coverage for specified
laboratory tests to specific medical diagnoses. Laboratory compliance policies should
ensure that the lab can support tests billed to Medicare with documentation obtained from
the physician ordering the test, an authorized person on the physician's staff or other
individual authorized by law to order tests. Laboratories should not: (1) use information
provided by the physician or other authorized individual from earlier dates of service
(other than standing orders, as discussed below at paragraph 4); (2) create diagnosis
information that has triggered reimbursement in the past; (3) use computer programs that
automatically insert diagnosis codes without receipt of diagnostic information from the
ordering physician or other authorized individual; or (4) make up information for claim
submission purposes. Laboratories should: (1) contact the ordering physician, authorized
person on the physician's staff or other individual authorized to order tests to obtain
information in the event that such information was not provided; and (2) accurately
translate narrative diagnoses obtained from the physician or other authorized individual
to ICD-9-CM codes. Where medical documentation is obtained from a physician or other
authorized individual after receipt of the specimen and the requisition form, it should be
maintained. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="c. Tests Covered by Claims for Reimbursement:">c. <u>Tests Covered by Claims for
Reimbursement</u>:</a> Only those tests that are ordered by an authorized individual or
physician, are performed and meet Medicare's conditions of coverage are reimbursable by
Medicare. If a laboratory receives a specimen without a valid test order or with a test
order which is ambiguous, the laboratory must verify the tests which the physician wants
and perform them before submitting a claim for reimbursement to Medicare. In this way, if
the physician or other authorized individual did not order the test, the laboratory will
not erroneously bill for it. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Similarly, if a laboratory did not perform an ordered test due to, for example, a
laboratory accident or insufficient quantities of specimen, the laboratory should not
submit a claim to Medicare. Medicare payment is made for tests that are ordered,
performed, and covered. The submission of a claim for tests that were either not ordered
or were not performed could subject a provider to sanctions under administrative, civil or
criminal law. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="d. Billing of Calculations:">d. <u>Billing of Calculations</u>:</a> Consistent
with Medicare coverage rules, laboratory compliance policies should ensure that the
laboratory does not bill both for calculations (<u>e.g.</u>, calculated LDLs, T7s, and
indices) and the tests that are performed to derive such calculations. In many situations,
physicians are not offered a choice about whether to receive such calculations, nor are
they aware of the practice of some laboratories to bill Medicare for such calculations in
addition to the underlying tests. The fact that a separate CPT code exists does not mean
that Medicare separately reimburses for the service assigned to the code. Billing both for
the calculations and the underlying tests constitutes double billing, which may subject a
laboratory to sanctions and other remedies available under civil, criminal, and
administrative law. <br wp="br2">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="e. Reflex Testing:">e. <u>Reflex Testing:</u></a> Reflex
testing occurs when initial test results are positive or outside normal parameters and
indicate that a second related test is medically appropriate. In order to avoid performing
unnecessary reflex tests, labs may want to design their requisition form in such a way
which would only allow for the reflex test when necessary. Therefore, the condition under
which the reflex test will be performed should be clearly indicated on the requisition
form. Labs may wish to adopt a similar policy for confirmation testing, which may be
mandatory. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="4. Reliance on Standing Orders"><strong>4. Reliance on Standing Orders</strong> </a><br
wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Although standing orders are not prohibited in connection with an
extended course of treatment, too often they have led to abusive practices. Standing
orders in and of themselves are not usually acceptable documentation that tests are
reasonable and necessary. Accordingly, the insurer may reject standing orders as evidence
that a test is reasonable and necessary. Medicare contractors can and may require
additional documentation to support the medical necessity of the test. As a result of the
potential problems standing orders may cause, the use of standing orders is discouraged. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Thus, while laboratory compliance programs may permit the use of standing orders executed
in connection with an extended course of treatment, the compliance program should require
the laboratory to periodically monitor standing orders. Standing orders should have a
fixed term of validity and must be renewed at their expiration. We suggest that,
consistent with state law requirements, a laboratory should contact all nursing homes from
which the laboratory has received such standing orders and request that they confirm in
writing the validity of all current standing orders. In addition, in accordance with state
law, laboratories should verify standing orders relied upon at draw stations with the
physician, authorized person on the physician's staff, or other authorized individual who
has provided the standing orders to the laboratory. With respect to patients with End
Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), at least once annually laboratories should contact each ESRD
facility or unit to request confirmation in writing of the continued validity of all
existing standing orders. <br wp="br1">

future. If appropriate, a laboratory should take the steps described in Section G
regarding investigations, reporting and correction of identified problems. <br wp="br1">

interests of patients, physicians, laboratories, the Government and private health plans
that physicians and other individuals authorized to order tests fully understand the
services offered by the laboratory, the services that will be provided when tests are
ordered, and the financial consequences for Medicare, as well as other payors, when tests
are billed. Accordingly, laboratories that market their services should ensure that their
marketing information is clear, correct, non-deceptive and fully informative. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="7. Prices Charged to Physicians"><strong>7. Prices Charged to Physicians</strong>
</a><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Laboratories are paid for their services by a variety of payors in addition to Medicare
and other federal health care programs. Such payors often include private health insurers,
other health care providers, and physicians. We believe it is essential that the physician
take into account the patient's best interest when deciding where to refer the patient's
specimen. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The prices that laboratories charge physicians for certain laboratory services raise
issues that should be addressed in a laboratory's written compliance policies. These
policies should ensure that laboratories are not providing any inducements to gain a
physician's business,<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> including charging physicians a
price below fair market value for their non-federal health care program tests.
Laboratories that charge physicians a price below fair market value to induce them to

Clinical laboratories should make the promotion of and adherence to compliance an element

along with other employees, should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and
procedures. In addition, all managers and supervisors involved in the sale, marketing, or
billing of laboratory services, and those who oversee phlebotomists should: (1) discuss
with all supervised employees the compliance policies and legal requirements applicable to
their function; (2) inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these
policies and requirements is a condition of employment; and (3) disclose to all supervised
personnel that the laboratory will take disciplinary action up to and including
termination for violation of these policies or requirements. In addition to making
performance of these duties an element in evaluations, the compliance officer or
laboratory management may also choose to include in the laboratory's compliance program a
policy that managers and supervisors may be sanctioned for failure to adequately instruct
their subordinates or for failing to detect non-compliance with applicable policies and
legal requirements, where reasonable diligence on the part of the manager or supervisor
would have led to the discovery of any problems or violations and given the laboratory the
opportunity to correct them earlier. <br wp="br1">

<p><font color="#000080">The proper education, training and retraining of corporate
officers, managers, and all other employees are significant elements of an effective
compliance program. As part of its compliance program, a clinical laboratory should
require all affected employees to attend specific training when they are first hired and
on a periodic basis thereafter, including appropriate training in federal and state
statutes, regulations, program requirements, the policies of private payors, and corporate
ethics. The training should emphasize the organization's commitment to compliance with
these legal requirements and policies. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
These training programs should include sessions highlighting the organization's compliance
program, summarizing fraud and abuse laws, and discussing coding requirements, claim
development, claim submission process, and marketing practices that reflect current legal
and program standards. The clinical laboratory must take steps to communicate effectively
its standards and procedures to all affected employees ( <u>e.g.</u>, by requiring
participation in training programs and disseminating publications that explain in a
practical manner specific requirements).<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> Managers of
specific departments can assist in identifying areas that require training and in carrying
out such training. Training instructors may come from outside or inside the organization.
New employees should be targeted for training early in their employment.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
The compliance officer should document the attendees, the subjects covered, and the
material distributed at the training sessions sponsored by the clinical laboratory as part
of the compliance program. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training, and training in several
different languages, particularly where a clinical laboratory has a culturally diverse
staff, should be implemented so that all affected employees are knowledgeable of the
clinical laboratory's standards of conduct and procedures for alerting senior management
to problems and concerns. Targeted training should be provided to corporate officers,
managers and other employees whose actions affect the accuracy of the claims submitted to
Government and private payors, such as employees involved in the coding, billing, and
marketing processes. For example, for certain employees involved in the billing and coding
functions, periodic training in proper CPT/HCPCs and ICD-9 coding and documentation should
be required. In addition to specific training in the areas identified in section II.A,
above, basic training for appropriate corporate officers, managers and other employees
should include such topics as: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">Government and private payor reimbursement principles;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">general prohibitions on paying or receiving remuneration to induce

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">duty to report misconduct.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080">Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through
training and educational programs are particularly relevant to the clinical laboratory's
marketing representatives, in that the pressure to meet business goals may render these
employees vulnerable to engaging in prohibited practices. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG suggests that all affected employees be made part of the clinical laboratory's
various educational and training programs. Employees should be required to have a minimum
number of educational hours per year, as appropriate, as part of their employment
responsibilities.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> In departments with high employee
turnover, periodic training updates are critical. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG recommends that attendance and participation in training programs be made a
condition of continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements
should result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is
serious. Adherence to the provisions of the compliance program, such as training
requirements, should be a factor in the annual evaluation of each employee. The clinical
laboratory should retain adequate records of its training of employees, including
attendance logs and material distributed at training sessions. <br wp="br1">

An open line of communication between the compliance officer and clinical laboratory
employees is equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program
and the reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse and waste. Written confidentiality and
non-retaliation policies should be developed and distributed to all employees to encourage
communication and the reporting of incidents of potential misconduct.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>
The compliance committee should also develop several independent reporting paths for an
employee to report fraud, waste or abuse so that such reports cannot be diverted by
supervisors or other personnel. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG encourages the establishment of a procedure so that clinical laboratory employees
may seek clarification from the compliance officer or members of the compliance committee
in the event of any confusion or question with regard to a laboratory policy or procedure.
Questions and responses should be documented and dated and, if appropriate, shared with
other staff so that standards, policies and procedures can be updated and improved to
reflect any necessary changes or clarifications. The compliance officer may want to
solicit employee input in developing these communication and reporting systems. <br

<p><font color="#000080">The OIG encourages the use of hotlines (including anonymous
hotlines), e-mails, written memoranda, newsletters, and other forms of information
exchange to maintain these open lines of communication. If the clinical laboratory
establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available to all
employees possibly by conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a
href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> Employees should be permitted to report matters on an
anonymous basis. Matters reported through the hotline or other communication sources that
suggest substantial violations of compliance policies, regulations, statutes or program
requirements of federal, state and private insurers should be documented and investigated
promptly to determine their veracity. A log should be maintained by the compliance officer
that records such calls, including the nature of any investigation and its results. Such
information should be included in reports to the governing body, the CEO and compliance
committee. Further, while the clinical laboratory should always strive to maintain the
confidentiality of an employee's identity, it should also explicitly communicate that
there may be a point where the individual's identity may become known or may have to be
revealed in certain instances when Governmental authorities become involved. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by employees who may have
participated in illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex
legal and management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The
compliance officer should work closely with legal counsel, who can provide guidance
regarding such issues. <br wp="br1">

federal and state laws, or those who have otherwise engaged in wrongdoing, which have the
potential to impair the clinical laboratory's status as a reliable, honest and trustworthy
health care provider. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The OIG believes that the compliance program should include a
written policy statement setting forth the degrees of disciplinary actions that may be
imposed upon corporate officers, managers, and other employees for failing to comply with
the clinical laboratory's standards and policies and applicable statutes and regulations.
Intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject transgressors to significant
sanctions. Such sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension or termination. The
written standards of conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling disciplinary
problems and those who will be responsible for taking appropriate action. Some
disciplinary actions can be handled by department managers, while others may have to be
resolved by a senior manager. Disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible
employee's failure to detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence or
reckless conduct. Employees should be advised by the clinical laboratory that disciplinary
action will be taken on a fair and equitable basis. Managers and supervisors should be
made aware that they have a responsibility to discipline employees in an appropriate and
consistent manner. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of disciplinary standards for improper
conduct and to educate corporate officers, managers and other employees regarding these
standards. The consequences of noncompliance should be consistently applied and enforced,
in order for the disciplinary policy to have the required deterrent effect. All levels of
employees should be subject to the same disciplinary action for the commission of similar
offenses. The commitment to compliance applies to all personnel levels within a clinical
laboratory. The OIG believes that corporate officers, managers, and other employees should
be held accountable for failing to comply with, or for the foreseeable failure of their
subordinates to adhere to, the applicable standards, laws, and procedures. <br wp="br1">

With regard to current employees, physicians or other individuals authorized to order
tests, physicians, if resolution of the matter results in conviction, debarment or

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="F. AUDITING AND MONITORING"><strong>F. <u>AUDITING AND
MONITORING</u></strong></a> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
An ongoing evaluation process involving thorough monitoring and regular reporting to the
clinical laboratory's corporate officers is critical to a successful compliance program.
Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring, including reports of suspected
noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance officer and shared with the clinical
laboratory's corporate officers and the compliance committee. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and
ensure compliance is the performance of regular compliance audits by internal or external
auditors who have expertise in federal and state health care statutes, regulations and the
program requirements of federal, state and private insurers. At a minimum, these audits
should be designed to address the clinical laboratory's compliance with laws governing
kickback arrangements, the physician self-referral prohibition, CPT/HCPCS coding and
billing, ICD-9 coding, claim development and submission, reimbursement, marketing,
reporting and record keeping. In addition, the audits and reviews should inquire into the
clinical laboratory's compliance with specific rules and policies that have been the focus
of particular attention on the part of the Medicare fiscal intermediaries or carriers, and
law enforcement, as evidenced by OIG Special Fraud Alerts, OIG audits and evaluations, and
publically announced law enforcement initiatives and also should focus on any areas of
concern that have been identified by any entity, (<u>i.e.</u>, federal, state, or
internally), specific to the individual clinical laboratory. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer to
identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine
the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for
legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer, corporate officer or manager may
want to limit any corrective action or take no action. If it is determined that the
deviation was caused by improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including fraud
and systemic problems, the clinical laboratory should take prompt steps to correct the
problem. If potential fraud or violations of the False Claims Act are involved, the
laboratory should report the potential violation to the Office of Inspector General or the
Department of Justice (see discussion in Section G.2, below). Any repayment of an
overpayment which results from such a violation should be made as part of the discussion
with law enforcement. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
When making any overpayment, the clinical laboratory should inform the payor of the
following information: (1) the refund is being made pursuant to a voluntary compliance
program; (2) a description of the complete circumstances surrounding the overpayment; (3)
the methodology by which the overpayment was determined; (4) any claim-specific
information used to determine the overpayment and; (5) the amount of the overpayment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The OIG believes that the compliance officer needs to be made
aware of these overpayment patterns, violations or deviations and look for trends that may
demonstrate a systemic problem. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at least annual) reviews
of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>, whether
there has been appropriate; (1) dissemination of the program's standards; (2) training;
(3) ongoing educational programs; and (4) disciplinary actions, among others. This process
will verify actual conformance with the compliance program. The review also should look
into whether appropriate records have been created and maintained to document the
implementation of an effective program. However, when monitoring discloses that deviations
were not detected in a timely manner due to program deficiencies, appropriate
modifications must be implemented. Such evaluations, when developed with the support of
management, can help ensure compliance with the clinical laboratory's policies and
procedures. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider
techniques such as: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">on-site visits; </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">interviews with personnel involved in management, marketing/sales,
    operations, coding/billing, claim development and submission, and other related
    activities;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of a broad
    cross-section of the clinical laboratory's employees and clients;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">review of requisition forms and other documents that support
    claims for reimbursement; </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">review of written materials and documentation produced by the
    laboratory and used by physicians and other individuals authorized to order test; and </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">trend analyses, or longitudinal studies, that seek deviations in
    billing or ordering patterns over a given period. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080">The reviewers should: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">be independent of line management;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">have access to existing audit resources, relevant personnel and
    all relevant areas of operation;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the
    CEO, governing body and members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but no
    less than annually; and</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080">With these reports, the clinical laboratory management can take
whatever steps are necessary to correct past problems and prevent them from recurring. In
certain cases, subsequent reviews or studies would be advisable to ensure that the
recommended corrective actions have been implemented successfully. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The clinical laboratory should document its efforts to comply with applicable statutes,
regulations and the program requirements of federal, state and private payors. For
example, where a clinical laboratory, in its efforts to comply with a particular statute,
regulation or program requirement, requests advice from a Government agency (including a
Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier) charged with administering a federal health care
program, the clinical laboratory should document and retain a record of the request and
any written or oral response. This step is particularly important if the clinical
laboratory intends to rely on that response. The laboratory should memorialize its
determination as to whether reliance on any such advice is reasonable, and its efforts to
develop procedures based upon such advice. <br wp="br1">

</a><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Violations of a clinical laboratory's compliance program, failures to comply with
applicable federal or state law, and other requirements of Government and private health
plans, and other types of misconduct threaten a clinical laboratory's status as a
reliable, honest and trustworthy provider capable of participating in federal health care
programs. Detected but uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the mission,
reputation, and legal status of the clinical laboratory. Consequently, upon reports or
reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance, it is important that the chief
compliance officer or other management officials initiate prompt steps to investigate the
conduct in question to determine whether a material violation of applicable law or the
requirements of the compliance program has occurred, and if so, take steps to correct the
problem.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> As appropriate, such steps may include an
immediate referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities, a corrective
action plan,<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> a report to the Government,<a
href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> and the submission of any overpayments, if applicable. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will
probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents. Some clinical laboratories
should consider engaging outside counsel, auditors, or health care experts to assist in an
investigation. Records of the investigation should contain documentation of the alleged
violation, a description of the investigative process, copies of interview notes and key
documents, a log of the witnesses interviewed and the documents reviewed, the results of
the investigation (<u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken), and the corrective action
implemented. While any action taken as the result of an investigation will necessarily
vary depending upon the clinical laboratory and the situation, clinical laboratories
should strive for some consistency by utilizing sound practices and disciplinary
protocols. Further, after a reasonable period, the compliance officer should review the
circumstances that formed the basis for the investigation to determine whether similar
problems have since been uncovered. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer
believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of
employees under investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work
activity until the investigation is completed (unless otherwise requested by law
enforcement). In addition, the compliance officer should take appropriate steps to secure
or prevent the destruction of documents or other evidence relevant to the investigation.
If the clinical laboratory determines that disciplinary action is warranted, it should be
prompt and imposed in accordance with the clinical laboratory's written standards of
disciplinary action. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<a name="2. Reporting"><strong>2. Reporting</strong> <br wp="br1">
</a><br wp="br2">
If the compliance officer, compliance committee or management official discovers credible
evidence of misconduct from any source and, after a reasonable inquiry, has reason to
believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil or administrative law, then the
clinical laboratory promptly should report the matter to the appropriate Governmental
authority<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> within a reasonable period, but not more
than sixty (60) days<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> after determining that there is
credible evidence of a violation.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> Prompt reporting
will demonstrate the clinical laboratory's good faith and willingness to work with
Governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem. In addition, reporting such
conduct will be considered a mitigating factor by the OIG in determining administrative
sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments, and exclusion), if the reporting provider
becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> <br
wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">When reporting misconduct to the Government, a clinical
laboratory should provide all evidence relevant to the potential violation of applicable
federal or state law(s) and potential cost impact. The compliance officer, under advice of
counsel, and with guidance from the Governmental authorities, could be requested to
continue to investigate the reported violation. Once the investigation is completed, the
compliance officer should be required to notify the appropriate Governmental authority of
the outcome of the investigation, including a description of the impact of the alleged
violation on the operation of the applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries.
If the investigation ultimately indicates that criminal or civil violations may have
occurred, the appropriate federal and state officials<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
should be notified immediately. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
As previously stated, the clinical laboratory should take appropriate corrective action,
including the imposition of proper disciplinary action, and prompt identification and
restitution of any overpayment to the affected payor. In cases where potential fraud or
violations of the False Claims Act are involved payment should be made as part of
discussions with law enforcement. Failure to repay overpayments within a reasonable period
of time could be interpreted as an intentional attempt to conceal the overpayment from the
Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation with
respect to the clinical laboratory, as well as any individuals who may have been involved.<a
href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> For this reason, clinical laboratory compliance programs
should emphasize that overpayments obtained from Medicare or other federal health care
programs should be promptly returned to the payor that made the erroneous payment. Section
F details the information which should be provided to the contractor when making a
repayment. <br wp="br1">

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation for development of an
effective and cost-efficient clinical laboratory compliance program. As previously stated,
however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources of an individual
clinical laboratory, depending upon its particular corporate structure, mission, size and
employee composition. The statutes, regulations and guidelines of the federal and state
health insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private health
plans, should be integrated into every clinical laboratory's compliance program. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches millions
of beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly evolving. As
stated throughout this guidance, compliance is a dynamic process that helps to ensure that
clinical laboratories and other health care providers are better able to fulfill their
commitment to ethical behavior, as well as meet the changes and challenges being imposed
upon them by Congress and private insurers. Ultimately, it is OIG's hope that a
voluntarily created compliance program will enable clinical laboratories to meet their
goals, improve the quality of services and control of claims submission, and substantially
reduce fraud, waste and abuse, as well as the cost of health care to federal, state and
private health insurers. <br wp="br1">

the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, provides that a person who has violated
the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government, in certain
circumstances will be subject to not less than double, as opposed to treble, damages. <u>See</u>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_12_">12. </a><sup>12</sup>The OIG believes that it is
not advisable for the compliance function to be subordinate to the clinical laboratory's
general counsel, or comptroller or similar officer. Free standing compliance functions
help to ensure independent and objective legal reviews and financial analyses of the
institution's compliance efforts and activities. By separating the compliance function
from the key management positions of general counsel or chief financial officer (where the
size and structure of the clinical laboratory make this a feasible option), a system of
checks and balances is established to more effectively achieve the goals of the compliance
program. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_13_">13. </a>For clinical laboratory chains, the OIG
encourages coordination with each affiliate owned by the company through the use of a
headquarter's compliance officer, communicating with the designated compliance officers in
each facility, or regional office, as appropriate. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_14_">14. </a><sup>14</sup>The OIG recommends the
compliance committee consist of individuals with varying perspectives and responsibilities

the OIG's Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection reports, and advisory opinions are
readily available from the OIG and could be the basis for standards and educational
courses for appropriate clinical laboratory employees. These documents can be found on the
OIG's website at http:\\www.dhhs.gov\progorg\oig. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_16_">16. </a>Certain positions, such as those
involving the coding of medical services, create a greater organizational legal exposure,

educational background and training. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_17_">17. </a>In its corporate integrity agreements,
the OIG usually requires a minimum number of hours annually for basic training in

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_18_">18. </a><sup>18</sup>The OIG believes that
whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation, a concept embodied in the
provisions of the False Claims Act. In many cases, employees sue their employers under the
False Claims Act's <u>qui</u> <u>tam </u>provisions out of frustration because of the
company's failure to take action when a questionable, fraudulent or abusive situation was
brought to the attention of senior corporate officials. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_19_">19. </a>Clinical laboratories should also post in
a prominent, available area the HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number, 1-800-HHS-TIPS
(447-8477), in addition to any company hotline number that may be posted. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_20_">20. </a><sup>20</sup>The Cumulative Sanction
Report is an OIG-produced report available on the Internet at <em>http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig</em>.
It is updated on a regular basis to reflect the status of health care providers who have
been excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the
General Services Administration maintains a monthly listing of debarred contractors on the
Internet at <em>http://epls.arnet.gov/</em>. Also, once the data base established by
the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection Act of 1996 is fully operational, the
hospital should regularly request information from this data bank as part of its employee
screening process. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_21_">21. </a><sup>21</sup>Likewise, clinical
laboratory compliance programs should establish standards prohibiting the execution of
contracts with physicians or other individuals authorized to order tests that have been
recently convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or that are listed by a
federal agency as debarred, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation in federal
health care programs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_23_">23. </a><sup>23</sup>The OIG recommends that when
a compliance program is established in a clinical laboratory, the compliance officer, with
the assistance of corporate officers, should take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of their
operations from a compliance perspective. This assessment can be undertaken by outside
consultants, law or accounting firms, or internal staff, with authoritative knowledge of
health care compliance requirements. This &quot;snapshot,&quot; often used as part of
benchmarking analyses, becomes a baseline for the compliance officer and other corporate
officers to judge the clinical laboratory's progress in reducing or eliminating potential
areas of vulnerability. For example, it has been suggested that a baseline level include
the frequency and percentile levels of each CPT code in relation to the clinical
laboratory's overall billing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_24_">24. </a>Instances of non-compliance must be
determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence, or amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to
a health care program is not solely determinative of whether or not the conduct should be

where there is no monetary loss at all, but corrective action and reporting are still
necessary to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_25_">25. </a>Advice from the clinical laboratory's

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_26_">26. </a><sup>26</sup>The OIG currently maintains
a voluntary disclosure program that encourages providers to report suspected fraud. The
concept of voluntary self-disclosure is premised on a recognition that the Government
alone cannot protect the integrity of the Medicare and other federal health care programs.
Health care providers must be willing to police themselves, correct underlying problems
and work with the Government to resolve these matters. The OIG's voluntary self-disclosure
program has four prerequisites: (1) the disclosure must be on behalf of an entity and not
an individual; (2) the disclosure must be truly voluntary (<u>i.e.</u>, no pending
proceeding or investigation); (3) the entity must disclose the nature of the wrongdoing
and the harm to the federal programs; and (4) the entity must not be the subject of a
bankruptcy proceeding before or after the self-disclosure. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><a name="N_29_">29. </a><sup>29</sup>The OIG believes that some
violations may be so serious that they warrant immediate notification to Governmental
authorities, prior to, or simultaneous with, commencing an internal investigation, <u>e.g.</u>,
if the conduct: (1) is a clear violation of criminal law; (2) has a significant adverse
effect on the quality of care provided to program beneficiaries (in addition to any other
legal obligations regarding quality of care); or (3) indicates evidence of a systemic
failure to comply with applicable laws, an existing corporate integrity agreement, or
other standards of conduct, regardless of the financial impact on federal health care
