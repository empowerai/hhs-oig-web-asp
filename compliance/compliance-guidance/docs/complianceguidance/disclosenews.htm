  Inspector General Issues Open Letter to Health Care Community;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Urges Providers to Self-Disclose Improper Conduct</strong><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health care providers that promptly 
  self-disclose improper conduct to the government may be eligible for favorable 
  treatment in the resolution of their cases, including less rigorous corporate 
  integrity agreements, Inspector General June Gibbs Brown stated today in an 
  open letter to the health care community.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We want to encourage providers 
  to come forward and disclose conduct that threatens the federal health care 
  programs, including Medicare and Medicaid,&quot; Brown said. &quot;A provider's 
  good-faith self-disclosure and continued cooperation go a long way in convincing 
  the Office of Inspector General that less rigorous integrity requirements are 
  needed to protect the federal programs.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, all corporate integrity 
  agreements include a provision to exclude a provider from participation in the 
  federal health care programs if the Office of Inspector General determines that 
  the provider has materially breached the terms of the agreement. Generally, 
  this provision is necessary to ensure that the Office of Inspector General maintains 
  the ultimate remedy to protect the federal health care programs from problem 
  providers.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many providers entering into corporate 
  integrity agreements have expressed concern about the exclusion remedy. The 
  Office of Inspector General may forego the exclusion remedy in appropriate self-disclosure 
  cases where the providers demonstrate sufficient trustworthiness to allow the 
  Office of Inspector General to conclude that the federal health care programs 
  can be safeguarded without the exclusion remedy.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, if a self-disclosing 
  provider has demonstrated that its compliance program is effective and agrees 
  to maintain its compliance program as part of a False Claims Act settlement, 
  the Office of Inspector General may not even require a corporate integrity agreement. 
  The decision on whether to impose a corporate integrity agreement is influenced 
  by a number of variables, including the scope and seriousness of the misconduct, 
  the risk of recurrence, whether the disclosed matter was identified and reported 
  as a result of the provider's compliance measures and the degree of the provider's 
  cooperation during the disclosure verification process.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases where it is necessary to 
  require the self-disclosing provider to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, 
  the provider may need to make only limited changes to its existing policies 
  and procedures to meet most of the requirements.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when the provider's 
  own audits detected the disclosed problem, the Office of Inspector General may 
  consider alternatives to standard auditing requirements and permit a self-disclosing 
  provider to perform some or all of the billing audits through internal auditors 
  rather than through an independent review organization. Additionally, the Office 
  of Inspector General may narrow the scope and focus of the claims review to 
  the areas found out of compliance or allow alternate audit methodologies in 
  place of the statistical sampling methodology generally required.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1995, the Office of Inspector 
  General has received a total of 75 self-disclosures from providers ranging from 
  hospitals to laboratories to physicians. The Office of Inspector General has 
  accepted 64 of the self-disclosures, and 11 of the cases have been resolved 
  with about $36.8 million slated for collection through civil and administrative 
  settlements or overpayment recoveries.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pilot voluntary disclosure program 
  was started by the Office of Inspector General in 1995 as part of Operation 
  Restore Trust, an anti-fraud initiative aimed at durable-medical equipment suppliers, 
  home health agencies, nursing homes and hospices in California, Florida, Illinois, 
  New York and Texas. To be eligible, an applicant had to be a corporate entity 
  doing business in one of the Operation Restore Trust states in one of the designated 
  health care sectors. Few providers took advantage of the pilot program, with 
  20 providers making self-disclosures and 14 being accepted between May 1995 
  and October 1998.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 1998, the Office of Inspector 
  General announced a new, more flexible provider self-disclosure protocol that 
  can be used by all health care providers doing business with Medicare, Medicaid 
  and other federal health care programs. Since the new protocol was announced, 
  55 providers have self-disclosed with 50 being accepted into the program. The 
  provider self-disclosure protocol is available on the Office of Inspector General's 
  Web site at http://oig.hhs.gov<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The self-disclosure protocol is designed 
  only for providers that believe a potential violation of the law may have occurred. 
  Matters exclusively involving overpayments or errors that do not indicate that 
  violations of the law have occurred should be brought directly to the attention 
  of the entity responsible for claims processing and payment.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
