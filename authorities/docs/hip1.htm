<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>I. Background</b> </p>

<p><u>The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank</u> </p>

<p>On October 30, 1998, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a proposed rule in
the <u>Federal Register</u> (63 FR 58341) designed to implement the statutory requirements
of section 1128E of the Social Security Act (the Act), as added by section 221(a) of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Section 221(a) of
HIPAA specifically directs the Secretary to establish a national health care fraud and
abuse data collection program for the reporting and disclosing of certain final adverse
actions taken against health care providers, suppliers and practitioners, and to maintain
a data base of final adverse actions taken against health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners. Final adverse actions include: (1) civil judgments against a health care
provider, supplier, or practitioner in Federal or State court related to the delivery of a
health care item or service; (2) Federal or State criminal convictions against a health
care provider, supplier or practitioner related to the delivery of a health care item or
service; (3) actions by Federal or State agencies responsible for the licensing and
certification of health care providers, suppliers or practitioners; (4) exclusion of a
health care provider, supplier or practitioner from participation in Federal or State
health care programs; and (5) any other adjudicated actions or decisions that the
Secretary establishes by regulation. Settlements in which no findings or admissions of
liability have been made will be excluded from reporting. Access to this new data bank is
limited to Federal and State Government agencies and health plans. </p>

<p>Reporting is limited to these same groups. Health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners may self query the data bank, but have no reporting responsibilities.<b>
</b>The Act also requires the Secretary to implement the national health care fraud
and abuse data collection program in such a manner as to (1) assure that the privacy of
individuals is maintained; (2) establish reasonable fees for disclosure of information to
recover full operating costs; and (3) avoid duplication with the reporting requirements
established for the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). This new data bank is known as
the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB).</p>

<p align="center"><b>II. Summary of the Proposed Rule</b></p>

<p>The proposed regulations published on October 30, 1998 were developed to establish a
new 45 CFR part 61 to implement the requirements for reporting of specific data elements
to, and procedures for obtaining information from, the HIPDB (and are applicable to
Federal and State Government agencies and health plans). Set forth below is a description
of the major provisions of the proposed rule, including, among other things, proposed
definitions for certain terms associated with the HIPDB, a discussion of the specific
reporting requirements and when such information must be reported, the fees applicable to
requests for information, the issues of the confidentiality of information, and how to
dispute the accuracy of information in the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Provisions of the Proposed Rule</u> <br>
<br>
<u>1. Definitions</u> <br>
<br>
The proposed regulations expanded on previous regulatory definitions and clarified aspects
of a number of terms set forth in the statute. The clarifications served to provide
additional examples of the scope of the statutory definitions, but did not go beyond
congressional intent. The proposed rule specifically set forth definitions for the terms
&quot;affiliated or associated;&quot; &quot;Government agency;&quot; &quot;health care
provider;&quot; &quot;health care supplier;&quot; &quot;health plan;&quot; &quot;licensed
health care practitioner, licensed practitioner and practitioner;&quot; and &quot;other
adjudicated actions or decisions.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>2. When information must be reported</u> <br>
<br>
The proposed regulations sought to establish the time frame for submitting reports to the
HIPDB. As proposed, information would be submitted to the HIPDB (1) within 30 calendar
days from the date the final adverse action was taken or the date when the reporting
entity became aware of the final adverse action, or (2) by the close of the entity's next
monthly reporting cycle, whichever is later. The date the final adverse action was taken,
its effective date and duration of the action would all be contained in the information
reported to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
We also proposed a list of &quot;mandatory&quot; data elements, as well as data elements
that must be reported to the data bank &quot;if known.&quot; We note that section
1128E(b)(2)(A) of the Act mandates that Federal and State Government agencies and health
care plans collect and report Social Security Numbers and Federal Employer Identification
Numbers for the purposes of reporting to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>3. Reporting errors, omissions, revisions and actions on appeal</u> <br>
<br>
In § 61.6 of the proposed regulations, we indicated that if any errors or omissions in
the final adverse action are discovered after the information has been reported, the
person or entity that reported such information must send an addition or correction to the
HIPDB within 60 calendar days of the discovery. We also proposed that any revision to the
action or to appeal status must similarly be reported within 30 calendar days after the
reporting entity learns of such revision or appeal. In turn, we proposed that each subject
of a report will receive a copy when it is entered into the HIPDB and a copy of all
revisions and corrections to the report. This is an opportunity only for the reporting
entity to correct any errors or omissions in the information, not for the subjects to
request re-adjudication of their cases. <br>
<br>
<u>4. Reporting licensure actions taken by Federal or State licensing and certification
agencies</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.7, we addressed the reporting of licensure actions taken by Federal and
State licensing and certification agencies. We proposed defining the phrase &quot;any
other negative action or finding&quot; by a Federal or State licensing and certification
authority to mean any action or finding that is publicly available and rendered by a
licensing or certification authority. These actions or findings include, but are not
limited to, imposition of civil money penalties (CMPs) and administrative fines,
limitations on the scope of practice, injunctions and forfeitures. As indicated in the
proposed rule, this definition included final adverse actions occurring in conjunction
with settlements in which no findings or admissions of liability have been made, and that
would otherwise be reportable under the statute. <br>
<br>
The statute also requires the reporting of a health care provider, supplier or
practitioner who voluntarily surrenders a license or certification. Based on extensive
discussions with various State agencies, we were advised that voluntary surrender and
non-renewal of licensure and provider participation agreements are not infrequently used
as means to exclude questionable health care providers, suppliers and practitioners from
participating in Federal and State health care programs. These voluntary surrenders and
non-renewal actions result in allowing questionable health care providers, suppliers or
practitioners to move from State to State without the new State licensing agency becoming
aware of the true nature of the action in the prior licensing State. Therefore, for
reporting purposes, we proposed that the term &quot;voluntary surrender&quot; include a
surrender made after a notification of investigation or a formal official request by
Federal or State licensing or certification authorities for a health care provider,
supplier or practitioner to surrender the license or certification (including
certification agreements or contracts for participation in Federal or State health care
programs). This proposed definition also included those instances where a health care
provider, supplier or practitioner voluntarily surrenders a license or certification
(including program participation agreements or contracts) in exchange for a decision by
the licensing or certification authority to cease an investigation or similar proceeding,
or in return for not conducting an investigation or proceeding, or in lieu of a
disciplinary action. <br>
<br>
We recognized that many voluntary surrenders are not a result of the types of adverse
actions that are intended for inclusion in the HIPDB. Therefore, we proposed that
voluntary surrenders and licensure non-renewals due to nonpayment of licensure fees,
changes to inactive status, and retirement be excluded from reporting to the HIPDB unless
they are taken in combination with one or more of the circumstances listed above (in which
case they would be reportable). <br>
<br>
<u>5. Reporting Federal or State criminal convictions related to the delivery of a health
care item or service</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.8, we stated that Federal and State law enforcement and investigative
agencies would be required to report criminal convictions against health care providers,
suppliers or practitioners. Consistent with section 1128E(g)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, we also
proposed that criminal convictions unrelated to the delivery of health care items or
services would not be reported under this section. <br>
<br>
<u>6. Reporting of civil judgments in Federal or State court related to the delivery of a
health care item or service</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.9, we put forth that Federal and State law enforcement and investigative
agencies and health plans be required to report civil judgments related to the delivery of
a health care item or service (except those resulting from medical malpractice) against
health care providers, suppliers or practitioners. The proposed rule indicated that civil
judgments must be entered or approved by a Federal or State court. We also proposed that
this reporting requirement would not include Consent Judgments that have been agreed upon
and entered to provide security for civil settlements in which there was no finding or
admission of liability. <br>
<br>
<u>7. Reporting exclusion from participation in Federal or State health care programs</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.10, we stated that the OIG would be required to report health care
providers, suppliers or practitioners excluded from participating in Federal or State
health care programs. We also proposed that this section include exclusions made in a
matter in which there also was a settlement even though the settlement itself is not
reported because no findings or admissions of liability had been made. <br>
<br>
<u>8. Reporting other adjudicated actions or decisions</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.11, we proposed that Federal and State agencies and health plans be
required to report other adjudicated actions or decisions. Although not specifically
required by the statute, we proposed that &quot;any other adjudicated actions or
decisions&quot; should relate to the delivery of a health care item or service, as do
criminal convictions and civil judgments collected under the statute. We also proposed in
this section that a due process mechanism be available with all adjudicated actions or
decisions. In the proposed rule, we provided examples of an adjudicated action or decision
to include, but not be limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>orders by an administrative law judge;</li>
  <li>CMPs and assessments;</li>
  <li>revocations, debarments or other restrictions from participating in Federal or State
    government contracts or programs;</li>
  <li>liquidation, dissolution, cancellation or revocation of a professional license; or</li>
  <li>limitations on either clinical privileges or staff privileges<b> </b>by a
    health plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>9. Fees applicable to requests for information</u> <br>
<br>
Proposed § 61.13 addressed fees applicable to all requests for information from the
HIPDB. In accordance with this proposed section, fees to be charged would be based on the
full costs of operating the database, as authorized in section 1128E(d)(2) of the Act;
criteria for assessing fees would be based on the guidelines set forth in OMB Circular
A-25. These costs would encompass all direct and indirect costs of providing such
information, including but not limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>direct and indirect personnel costs; </li>
  <li>physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs; </li>
  <li>agency management and supervisory costs; and </li>
  <li>costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment, regulations and guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p>For maximum efficiency, we proposed that the HIPDB be an all-electronic system, with
all fees collected through the most cost-effective methods (such as credit card and
electronic funds transfer). The Act exempts Federal agencies from these fees. <br>
<br>
<u>10. Confidentiality of HIPDB information</u> <br>
<br>
In proposed § 61.14, we stated that the confidentiality requirements would apply to all
information obtained from the HIPDB. The confidentiality requirements are clearly
specified in sections 1128E(b)(3) and (d)(1) and 1128C(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.
Specifically, section 1128E(b)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to protect the privacy
of individuals receiving health care services when determining what information is
required. Section 1128E(d)(1) of the Act requires that information in the HIPDB will be
available to Federal and State Government agencies and health plans. Section
1128C(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act requires the Secretary to assure that HIPDB information is
provided and utilized in a manner that appropriately protects the confidentiality of the
information. We proposed that information from this system be confidential and disclosed
only for the purpose for which it was provided. We also proposed that appropriate uses of
the information would include the prevention of fraud and abuse activities and improving
the quality of patient care. This proposed provision did not go beyond the requirements
set forth in the Act. The proposed requirements would not prevent an authorized user from
sharing information from the HIPDB within the entity that requested it, as long as the
information is used solely for the purpose for which it was provided. However, in
accordance with section 1128E(b)(3) of the Act, we proposed that information obtained by a
Government contractor, e.g., a Medicare carrier, an intermediary or auditor, may only be
used in the furtherance of its contractual responsibilities. <br>
<br>
<u>11. How to obtain access to, and dispute the accuracy of, HIPDB information</u> <br>
<br>
The proposed regulations outlined the procedures for obtaining access to a report,
submitting a statement, filing a dispute, and revising disputed information in a
previously submitted report. These procedures are basically comparable to, or more
generous than, procedures established in the Department's Privacy Act regulations at 45
CFR part 5b. The Secretary has exempted the HIPDB from those Privacy Act requirements in
order to establish a more comprehensive and generous notification, access and correction
procedure. While these procedures basically are comparable to similar provisions in the
Privacy Act, these procedures include significant rights in addition to those set forth in
the Privacy Act. For example, when a HIPDB report is created or amended, we automatically
provide subjects a copy of the all report. Subjects may also file a statement of
disagreement with a report as soon as the report is filed , rather than at the end of an
appeal process, as under the Privacy Act. <br>
<br>
In addition, we proposed that the subject of a report may dispute only the factual
accuracy of the information contained in the HIPDB report concerning the individual or
entity. As indicated in the proposed rule, the dispute process would afford the subject an
opportunity to bring relevant factual information, including reversals of criminal
convictions by an appeals court, to the attention of the reporter. The proposed dispute
process would be consistent with that for the NPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>12. Sanctions for failure to report</u> <br>
<br>
We incorporated the new CMP sanctions provision for failure to report information to the
data bank, as set forth in section 4331 of Public Law 105-33, the Balanced Budget Act of
1997. In the proposed rule, we indicated that any health plan that fails to report
information on a final adverse action that is required to be reported would be subject to
a CMP of not more than $25,000 for each such adverse action not reported. Such penalties
would be imposed and collected in the same manner as other CMPs under section 1128A of the
Act. </p>

<p align="center"><b>III. Summary and Response to Public Comments</b></p>

<p>As we have noted, the statute upon which the proposed regulations were drafted is quite
broad and affords the Secretary numerous areas of discretionary authority on which we
sought the benefit of public comment and input. The proposed rule set forth a 60-day
public comment period ending December 29, 1998. On December 30, 1998, we extended the
comment period for the proposed rule by an additional 2 weeks until January 11, 1999 (63
FR 71819). As a result, we received a total of 117 timely-filed public comments from
Federal and State law enforcement agencies; health care practitioner and provider
licensing boards, health departments, private attorneys representing health care
providers, suppliers and practitioners; and various health plans, health plan
associations, hospitals, professional associations, health care practitioners and other
individuals and entities. Based on review of the statute and the assessment of public
comments received, we believe the final regulations implementing this authority fully and
adequately balance the concerns of the Department with those expressed by outside
individuals and entities. <br>
<br>
Set forth below is an overview of the various comments and recommendations received and
our responses to those concerns. Section IV. of this preamble sets forth a summary of the
specific revisions and clarifications to be made to the final regulations as a result of
those comments. <br>
<br>
<u><b>A. Scope and Intent of the HIPDB</b></u> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> A<b><em> </em></b>principal concern raised in the majority of
comments was the interpretation of what constitutes the reporting threshold for all final
adverse actions under the term &quot;health care fraud and abuse.&quot; Many commenters
believed that the OIG broadened the definitions and criteria unnecessarily for reportable
actions, well beyond a &quot;health care fraud and abuse&quot; data collection system.
Specifically, these commenters only wanted actions involving health care related fraud and
abuse reported to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> It is clear from reviewing the statutory language of the implementing
Act, and the legislative history (such as congressional conference reports), that the
HIPDB is not merely about establishing an information collection system. Rather, it is
directed at combating fraud and abuse in a broader scope. Congress used the term health
care fraud and abuse only once in the provision's opening paragraph for purposes of naming
the data collection program. The term does not appear elsewhere, especially with regard to
limiting the scope of reportable actions. Instead, Congress defined reportable &quot;final
adverse actions&quot; by specifying a finite list of actions. These actions include civil
judgments related to the delivery of a health care item or service; Federal or State
criminal convictions related to the delivery of a health care item or service; actions
taken by Federal or State licensing or certification agencies; exclusions from
participation in Federal or State health care programs; and any other adjudicated actions
or decisions taken by a Federal or State Government agency or health plan. To limit the
adverse actions collected by the data bank to only those that are based on health care
fraud and abuse would create a data bank that does not fully capture the types of reports
that Congress clearly intended to be collected in accordance with the statute. <br>
<br>
The term &quot;health care fraud and abuse,&quot; as used in the statute, merely
represents congressional intent that the HIPDB support efforts to prevent such activities.
To limit actions collected only to those based on fraud and abuse would deny
investigators, Government contracting officers, health plans and others the reports which
are necessary to effectively research the relevant backgrounds of potential providers,
suppliers and practitioners. As indicated by one State licensing board, narrowing the
scope of reportable actions may create an even greater burden on reporters to screen out
final adverse action based solely on health care fraud and abuse. Accordingly, the
definition related to final adverse actions, as well as the definitions of health care
provider, supplier and practitioner, represent the statutorily-mandated reporting criteria
for the HIPDB -- and is not limited to health care fraud and abuse. It has been our goal
to establish a complete and comprehensive data bank that effectively deters health care
fraud and abuse in the health care industry, while promoting quality health care and
protecting the public. A further discussion of the term &quot;health care fraud and
abuse&quot; is contained in section III. B. 6. of this preamble. <br>
<br>
<u><b>B. Section-by-Section Analysis of Issues</b> </u><br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.1 The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters viewed the regulations, in general, as overly-broad and
complex. Two commenters stated that information reported to the HIPDB should be directly
related to health care fraud and abuse (see discussion regarding the definition of
&quot;health care fraud and abuse&quot; in the discussion of § 61.3 later in this section
of this preamble). Another commenter expressed concern that the HIPDB would contain data
on individuals who have not committed fraud. This commenter and others believed that the
OIG will establish a vast system not targeted to identify truly egregious individuals and
entities. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We disagree with these comments. As indicated in the proposed rule and in
the summary section above in this preamble, we believe this rulemaking and the HIPDB
clearly focus on specific final adverse actions taken against individuals and entities,
and that those actions relate to these actions that could be defined as &quot;health care
fraud and abuse.&quot; We believe these implementing regulations and the data bank are
consistent with statutory intent and are properly targeted at capturing specific types of
information relevant to the HIPDB's intended purpose. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.3 Definitions</u>. </b><br>
<br>
<b>1. Affiliated<em> </em>or associated</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> With regard to the definition and application of the term &quot;affiliated
or associated,&quot; several commenters stated that the proposed definition overreached
the intent of the statute. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG believes the definition supports congressional intent to enable
authorized users who conduct fraud and abuse investigations to identify other business or
commercial affiliations through which the subject may have committed other acts of
wrongdoing, and to aid with subject identification, if the affiliation or association is
known by the reporter. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters requested the definition be refined to exclude
irrelevant affiliations and associations. The commenters recommended that the definition
be limited to (1) those entities in which the subject has a business interest, and (2)
those associations having the power to revoke or suspend a license. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We agree that the definition and implementation of the term
&quot;affiliated or associated&quot; set forth in the proposed rule may have resulted in
some confusion. As a result, we are limiting the definition, in accordance with the first
part of the commenters' concerns, to those health care entities in which the subject has a
commercial interest. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> A number of commenters believed that the collection of this information
set forth in the definition would be in violation of the Privacy Act, as it implies guilt
by association. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The inclusion of an entity in this category by a reporter will in no way
imply that the entity was a party to the act(s) or omission(s) that led to a reportable
final adverse action. We believe that the revised definition will eliminate naming of
professional affiliations or associations and the implied fear of invasion of privacy. We
also note only individuals, <u>not</u> entities (even if the entity is an individual
professional corporation), are protected by the Privacy Act. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter believed that &quot;affiliated or associated&quot; entities
should be included only if such entities had an active role in the underlying sanction.
Another commenter stated the names of &quot;affiliated or associated&quot; entities should
be expunged after an investigation that determined there was no involvement by the
affiliation or association entity. A third commenter believed that there would be
increased liability for reporters as a result of the definition set forth for this term. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We believe limiting &quot;affiliations or associations&quot; to those
health care entities with an active role in the underlying sanction, or removing the names
after an investigation has determined there was no involvement by the affiliated or
associated entity, would be contrary to the specific language of the statute. The statute
explicitly requires that the names of affiliated or associated health care entities be
reported. Involvement or non-involvement in the underlying action is irrelevant to this
reporting requirement. Further, we do not agree that merely identifying an entity as being
affiliated with the subject of a report somehow imputes wrongdoing to the affiliated
entity, and a statement to this effect will be included in the data base report. There
will be no independent identification of affiliated or associated entities in the HIPDB
other than as part of a subject's report, unless the entity also has been the subject of a
final adverse action. If it comes to the attention of a business entity that it is
incorrectly identified in a subject's report as having a commercial business affiliation
with the subject, then the business entity may avail itself of the same correction
procedures that are available to the subject of a report. The affiliated entity first may
ask the reporting agency or health plan to correct the subject's report. If the reporter
declines to do so, the affiliated entity may request a correction to the subject's report
by the Secretary. With respect to an increase in liability for reporters, the OIG is
providing an immunity provision in the final rule that will alleviate any perceived
increase in liability. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter requested that the HIPDB provide written notice to each
entity listed as an &quot;affiliated or associated health care entity&quot; within a final
adverse action report, and that the HIPDB offer an appeal process to these entities in the
event that the entities are incorrectly reported. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The revised definition will require that a commercial relationship exist
between the subject and the affiliate or associate. As we have previously noted, we
believe that this data field in no way implies wrongdoing on the part of the reported
affiliate or associate, and thus eliminates the need for these entities to be notified. <br>
<br>
<b>2. Any other negative action or finding</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> We received several comments regarding the manner in which the term
&quot;any other negative action or finding&quot; was defined. Most of the commenters
stated the proposed definition was too broad in nature and would create a tremendous
burden on the reporters, especially if actions or findings pertaining to administrative
fines and citations were to be included in the HIPDB. Several commenters expressed concern
that there is a range of actions or findings taken that may or may not be the same from
State to State and do not relate to health care <u>per se</u> (such as a practitioner
fined for failure to provide a new address). The commenters requested that the OIG clarify
and limit the definition of this term to actions that are directly connected to health
care violations. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We agree with the commenters that there will be variation from State to
State regarding the types of final actions taken against health care providers, suppliers
and practitioners. However, the HIPDB is being designed as a &quot;flagging system&quot;
that will contain information on actions taken in a particular State or program that are
considered by the State or program to warrant attention. We intend the data to provide a
summary of the actions taken against a health care provider, supplier or practitioner. In
addition, we acknowledge that there are certain kinds of actions or findings that would
not meet the intent of the legislation and should not be reportable. For instance,
administrative actions, such as limited training permits, limited licenses for
telemedicine, fines or citations that do not restrict a practitioner's practice, or
personnel actions for tardiness, are not within the range of actions intended by the
statute. As a result of these comments, we are modifying the final regulations to exclude
administrative fines or citations, corrective action plans and other personnel actions
unless they are (1) connected to the billing, provision or delivery of health care
services, and (2) taken in conjunction with other licensure or certification actions such
as revocation, suspension, censure, reprimand, probation, or surrender. For example, a
nurse agreed to settle claims that he received Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to
which he was not entitled. As a result of this action, the State licensing board
reprimanded the nurse and imposed a $5,000 fine. This action would be reportable. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters expressed concern that the preamble language that
indicated that &quot;settlements in which no findings or admissions of liability have been
made will be excluded from reporting&quot; conflicted with the next sentence in that
discussion, which read, &quot;However, any final adverse action that emanates from such
settlements and consent judgments, and that would otherwise be reportable under the
statute, is to be reported to the data bank.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We agree that the statutory language is clear that settlement in which no
findings of liability have been made will not be reportable to the HIPDB. However, if
another action is taken against the provider, supplier or practitioner of a health care
item or service, as a result of or in conjunction with the settlement, the second action
is reportable. For example, a civil court settlement in which no finding against or
admission of liability by a practitioner is made is not reportable. However, for example,
if the State licensing board suspends the practitioner's license as a result of a civil
court settlement, the licensing board must report the suspension of the license.
Similarly, if the OIG excludes a provider, supplier or practitioner based on actions that
were also the subject of a civil settlement in which no finding or admission of liability
was made, the exclusion must be reported to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter questioned whether non-practitioners, such as an executive
director, should be reported to the HIPDB, while another commenter requested clarification
on the reporting of actions pertaining to the handling of an impaired practitioner. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG reiterates the statutory intent that any final action taken
against a licensed or certified health care provider, supplier or practitioner by a
Federal or State licencing or certification agency that is publicly available information <u>is</u>
a reportable action. If, for example in the case of an executive director, he or she is
licensed or certified as a health care provider, supplier or practitioner, then that
individual will be subject to the HIPDB reporting requirements. If a Federal or State
licensing agency takes a final adverse action that is publicly available information
against an impaired practitioner, the final adverse action is reportable. <br>
<br>
<b>3. Clinical privileges</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters expressed concern that Congress never intended that
clinical privilege actions would be reported to the HIPDB, particularly since such actions
are already reported to the NPDB. Some commenters expressed a desire that clinical
privileges suspensions only be reported when they are in effect for a period longer than
30 days, indicating that this limitation would parallel existing NPDB requirements for
reporting of clinical privilege actions. Another commenter questioned why the proposed
definition specifically mentioned physicians and dentists, when they believed the
definition was to apply to all licensed health care practitioners. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG agrees with these concerns and, as a result, the HIPDB will not
collect data on clinical privileging actions. We note that clinical privileging actions
are already collected by the NPDB. We believe that information on clinical privileging
actions will not be of significant value to HIPDB queriers, since queriers who have a need
for this information will already be accessing it through the NPDB. Accordingly, we are
adding language to the definition of the term &quot;other adjudicated actions or
decisions&quot; to specify that the reporting of clinical privileging actions is excluded.
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Exclusion</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter raised a concern about the term &quot;exclusion&quot; and
mistakenly applied the definition for this term to a reportable licensure action. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG has clarified that the term &quot;exclusion&quot; applies only to
debarment of an individual or entity from participation in any Federal or State health
care related program; this term is only applicable to reporting exclusion from
participation in Federal or State health care programs. <br>
<br>
<b>5. Government agency</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter asserted that the definition of &quot;Government
agency&quot; was too broad and potentially open-ended. The commenter requested
clarification as to which agencies qualify as &quot;Federal and State agencies responsible
for the licensing and certification of health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners.&quot; A second commenter suggested that the definition of &quot;Government
agency&quot; be amended to include all agencies authorized to investigate health care
fraud. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We recognize the commenters' concerns and understand that regulatory
boards and licensing programs vary from State to State. For this very reason, however, it
is not possible for the OIG in this rulemaking to provide a listing of <u>all</u> agencies
responsible for the licensing and certification of health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners. In response to the proposed rule, we received only two comments from States
that identified the agencies responsible for licensing. We believe that the definition of
&quot;Government agency&quot; includes<b> </b><u>all</u> agencies authorized to
investigate health care fraud and abuse and, as a result, are making no changes to the
final rule. <br>
<br>
<b>6. Health care fraud and abuse</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> In general, comments reflected an assumption that the terms &quot;health
care fraud&quot; and &quot;health care abuse&quot; defined the reporting criteria for all
final adverse actions mandated by the statute. Specifically, commenters found the term
&quot;health care fraud,&quot; when used in conjunction with the proposed preamble
definition of &quot;health care abuse,&quot; to be too broad. Several commenters requested
that definitions for health care fraud and abuse (and thus the nature of adverse actions
collected) be limited to activities relating to financial violations, or require the
reportable activities to meet a legal standard of fraud or abuse. One commenter stated
that health care abuse should be limited to those actions against a health care system and
not those relating to personal abuse. Other commenters believed that the terms should be
combined into one definition. One State licensing agency requested specific guidance on
whether all final adverse actions must be based on health care fraud and abuse to be
reportable to HIPDB. The agency pointed out that only one percent of its adverse licensing
actions would meet such a fraud and abuse reporting threshold. Three commenters did
acknowledge and agree that the term &quot;health care abuse&quot; was properly described
within the regulation and the statute as &quot;final adverse actions.&quot;</p>

<p><u>Response:</u> By attempting to define the terms &quot;health care fraud&quot; and
&quot;health care abuse&quot; in the proposed rule, we gave the erroneous impression to
some readers that final adverse actions may not be reported to the data bank unless they
are categorized by the reporter as being based upon &quot;health care fraud and
abuse.&quot; That interpretation is too limiting. Congress intended that this data bank
support efforts to prevent and combat health care fraud and abuse, and not merely
catalogue adverse actions that reporters may choose to describe as arising from
&quot;health care fraud and abuse.&quot; Restricting reportable final adverse actions to
those specifically relating to health care fraud and abuse would eliminate the reporting
of many relevant actions that are included in the statutory definition of &quot;final
adverse actions.&quot; Accordingly, and as a result of the comments received, we are
deleting the definition for the term &quot;health care fraud&quot; from the final rule and
are opting not to define &quot;health care abuse.&quot; Instead, we defer to the statutory
definition of &quot;final adverse actions&quot; as encompassing the range of actions to be
reported.</p>

<p><u>Comment:</u> Several commenters requested changes to the &quot;health care fraud and
abuse&quot; definition to narrow the range of actions, indicating that final adverse
actions related to billing errors, benefits administration, payment and reimbursement
issues, and quality of patient outcomes be excluded from the definition of &quot;health
care fraud and abuse.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> There may be instances when billing errors, benefits administration,
payment and reimbursement issues, and quality of patient outcomes meet the criteria and,
therefore, will be reported. However, it is also foreseeable that certain of the
aforementioned actions may not be final adverse actions and, therefore, not reportable.
The OIG takes the position that any action is reportable to the data bank as long as the
action meets the criteria of a &quot;final adverse action,&quot; as specified in the final
rule. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter requested that &quot;health care fraud&quot; exclude
offenses by health plans or insurance companies and be limited to offenses by health care
providers, suppliers, or practitioners against health plans or health plan sponsors.
Another commenter stated that the reporting of health care abuse should be optional and
CMPs should not be imposed for failure to report. One commenter questioned the value of
report data containing actions related to health care abuse since such actions may suggest
a standard of measurement less than a court adjudication or administrative review panel
finding. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG believes that excluding organizations, such as health plans and
insurance companies, would limit the effectiveness of the data bank to serve its intended
function as a fraud and abuse prevention tool. We also believe that the intent of the
statute is clear that <u>all</u> final adverse actions taken against a health care
provider, supplier or practitioner must be reported to the HIPDB, and that failure to
report such actions may result in the imposition of a CMP. <br>
<br>
<b>7. Health care provider</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters indicated that the definition of &quot;health care
provider&quot; was too broad and complex, and suggested as an alternative that the OIG use
the definition set forth in section 1861(u) of the Act. Two commenters objected to the
inclusion of health care entities, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in this
definition. The commenters believed the definition for this term was conflicting, since
health care entities could be potential subjects of the HIPDB as well as reporting
entities. One commenter stated that most States did not take compliance actions against
these types of entities. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Since Congress elected not to define &quot;health care provider&quot; in
the Act, we believe the congressional intent was for this term to be defined broadly.
There is no inherent conflict in health care entities being potential subjects of the
HIPDB, as well as reporting entities. This is entirely consistent with the intent of the
Act. <br>
<br>
<b>8. Health care supplier<em> </em></b><br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> The majority of commenters responding to the definition of &quot;health
care supplier&quot; stated that the definition went beyond statutory authority and could
allow inappropriate access to information. For example, several commenters noted that the
definition included both direct and indirect providers of health care items and services.
Several commenters recommended the definition be limited to suppliers as defined in
section 1861(s) of the Act, and believed that the definition should not include health
insurance or benefits providers, such as insurance agents, brokers, solicitors,
consultants and reinsurance intermediaries. Other commenters pointed out that to broadly
include health insurance or benefit providers in the definition of supplier also could
have the effect of including nearly all public and private employers as the potential
subjects of reports. These commenters requested that suppliers be limited to those who
directly provide covered items or services to beneficiaries, or who directly receive
reimbursement from a health care program. <br>
<br>
One commenter requested that reportable subjects not be limited to practitioners,
providers and suppliers, but rather encompass all individuals and entities involved in
health care fraud, including beneficiaries, Government and private employees, managed care
marketers and any individual who is responsible for the actions of an entity. One
commenter requested clarification of the term &quot;subject.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We disagree with the contention of some commenters that Congress intended
to collect final adverse action information only on <u>direct</u> providers of items or
services covered by a health care program or plan. Such a definition would exclude many
entities that are the subject of health care fraud and abuse investigations and actions.
The OIG believes that the intent of Congress was to have a broad interpretation of the
terms supplier, practitioner and provider. For example, Congress did define the terms
&quot;health care practitioner&quot; and &quot;health care provider&quot; elsewhere in the
statute, yet it did not specifically apply these definitions to the HIPDB. The term
&quot;health care supplier&quot; is defined in these regulations to capture all final
adverse actions relating to the delivery of a health care item or service. Accordingly,
the OIG is electing to keep both direct and <u>indirect</u> suppliers in the definition of
&quot;health care supplier.&quot; Including indirect suppliers in the definition also is
consistent with the definition of &quot;supplier&quot; used in the regulations
implementing OIG exclusion authorities resulting from HIPAA (63 FR 46676; September 2,
1998). <br>
<br>
However, we do not intend to include in the definition of &quot;supplier&quot; all public
and private employers, unless they are self-insured for health care coverage. The
definition will still include health plans, consultants, health insurance producers,
agents, brokers and reinsurance intermediaries. On the other hand, the definition will not
include businesses that merely provide their employees with health insurance coverage
through a contract with a health insurance producer or a health plan. Therefore, in
response to the concerns raised by the various commenters, we have modified the definition
of &quot;health care supplier&quot; to clarify and limit its scope. Accordingly, we are
replacing the proposed language with the term &quot;health plan&quot; and are inserting
additional language excluding employers, unless they are self-insured. <br>
<br>
In response to the request that reporting be expanded beyond health care providers,
suppliers and practitioners, we note that individuals or entities can only be subjects of
HIPDB reports if final adverse actions were taken against them. Beneficiaries are not
included in that category. For the purposes of this regulation, the term
&quot;subject&quot; means a health care provider, supplier or practitioner upon whom a
reportable final adverse action was taken. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Two commenters indicated that States' burden of reporting would be
increased since States do not regulate or collect data about many of the types of entities
included in the supplier definition. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG reiterates that only final adverse actions, as specified in the
statute and these regulations, taken against health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners are reportable. Such actions are to be reported by the organization taking
the action. The specific data required to be reported and responses to comments regarding
the reporting burden are addressed below in response to comments on the regulatory impact
statement. <br>
<br>
<b>9. Health plan</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> With regard to the proposed definition of the term &quot;health
plan,&quot; commenters stated the definition is too broad, and suggested that the OIG use
the definition as set forth in section 1128E of the Act, which incorporates the definition
set forth in section 1128C(c) of the Act. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG maintains that the statutory intent of the definition was not
meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. The OIG interprets congressional use of the word
&quot;includes&quot; in the statutory definition as an indication that additional entities
may be recognized as &quot;health plans&quot; if they meet the basic definition of
&quot;providing health benefits.&quot; Therefore, we will continue to use a broad
definition. The statutory language indicates that Congress intended that &quot;guarantors
of payment&quot; for health care services and items, including &quot;self insured
employers&quot; who are often the subjects of health care fraud, have access to HIPDB
information. The OIG believes that limiting the definition to the language of the statute
would not provide a workable basis for organizations and those who provide health care
services to appropriately determine their reporting responsibilities under the statute. In
response to one commenter's recommendation to make the definition more inclusive, we are
providing further clarification and modifying the proposed definition. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter requested an exclusion be provided within the definition for
direct reimbursements of an employee, stating there is no relationship between the
employer who provides the reimbursement and the practitioner who provides the service. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> As revised, the definition of the term &quot;health plan&quot; reflects
the variety of benefit plans with a wide range of organizations, groups and individuals
that currently offer such health benefits that would include direct reimbursement. Given
this change, we believe any further revision is not necessary. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter believed that State-sponsored workman's compensation
programs should be included as an example of a health plan. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> It is our intention that State-sponsored workman's compensation programs
be covered under the regulations, and we believe the definition, as written, includes such
programs, although not stated explicitly. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Two commenters stated the proposed definition would cause confusion as to
which entity is responsible for reporting the action, i.e., the employer providing the
health care policy or the insurance corporation with whom the employer has contracted. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We are aware of the multiple structures under which a &quot;health
plan&quot; may operate within an integrated health system. The final regulations state the
entity taking the action is responsible for reporting the action to the HIPDB. The
activity of reporting can be delegated to another entity, but the ultimate responsibility
for the report will still lie with the entity taking the action. <br>
<br>
<b>10. Licensed health care practitioner, licensed practitioner or practitioner</b>
<br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters suggested that the definition for this term should be
more specific and include additional practitioner groups not listed, such as occupational
therapists and occupational therapists' assistants. The commenters recommended that by
providing a comprehensive list of all practitioners and allied health personnel eligible
to be possible subjects of reports to the HIPDB, the OIG would ensure that all States
report consistently regardless of their differences in professional licensing categories. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We note that the meaning of the term &quot;licensed health care
practitioner, licensed practitioner or practitioner&quot; is consistent with the
definition in section 1128E(g)(2) of the Act. We added the phrase &quot;but not limited
to&quot; before our listing in order to provide adequate leeway for the inclusion of other
health care practitioners as each individual State develops its own reporting categories.
While we recognize the benefits of conformity in reporting practices, we have chosen not
to sacrifice State flexibility and authority in determining appropriate reporting
categories. Even Federal definitions may vary as to &quot;categorizing&quot; health care
workers. In section 1861(s) of the Act, for example, both physical and occupational
therapists are listed under the definition of supplier. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Other commenters requested clarification on how this definition will be
interpreted in States with &quot;title protection statutes.&quot; Generally, title
protection statutes only restrict the use of a title of a health care practitioner and not
the actual practice or the delivery of the service itself. Under title protection
statutes, an individual may practice the profession without a license, but may not use the
title unless licensed by the regulatory board. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The definition, as written, is consistent with the statutory language. We
recognize that &quot;title protection statutes&quot; may vary with each individual State.
However, the statute only authorizes the collection of final adverse action information on
an individual who is licensed or otherwise authorized by the State to provide health care
services (including any individual who, without authority, holds himself or herself out to
be so licensed or authorized by the State). <br>
<br>
<b>11. Organization name and type</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment</u>: We received several comments concerning the mandatory element of
&quot;organization name and type.&quot; Some commenters stated that they did not collect
this type of information, while others were unclear as to the meaning of this term. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> As a result of these comments, we are clarifying this term by
specifically adding a new definition in § 61.3 for the terms &quot;organization
name&quot; and &quot;organization type.&quot; <br>
<br>
<b>12. Other adjudicated actions or decisions</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Commenters raised numerous issues concerning different aspects of the
definition for the term &quot;other adjudicated actions or decisions.&quot; Several
commenters stated that the proposed definition was too broad or burdensome, and extended
beyond the scope of the statute. </p>

<p>A number of commenters suggested that all reportable &quot;adjudicated actions or
decisions&quot; should be related only to fraud. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG believes that the range of reportable &quot;other adjudicated
actions or decisions&quot; is not overly broad or beyond the scope of the Social Security
Act, since the statutory language states that all final adverse actions must be reported.
Furthermore, as indicated above, the statute does not define fraud and abuse; it only
defines final adverse actions. To promote an effective system to aid in deterring fraud
and abuse, we believe it is necessary to define this term more inclusively, as is
contemplated by the statute. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> The criteria set forth for the term &quot;other adjudicated actions or
decisions&quot; caused confusion for a majority of commenters. Specifically, commenters
indicated that they were unclear as to the meaning of the phrase &quot;official
action,&quot; and whether actions involving (1) honest billing errors or differences in
medical judgment, (2) employment or personnel-related actions and (3) CMPs would be
reportable under this definition. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In response to these concerns, we have restructured the definition to
clarify that in order for a formal or official action to be reported under this provision
it must meet the three criteria that it (1) is taken against a health care provider,
supplier or practitioner by a Federal or State Governmental agency or a health plan; (2)
includes the availability of a due process mechanism; and (3) is based on acts or
omissions that affect or could affect the payment, provision or delivery of a health care
item or service. We also made minor changes in the definition to provide further clarity
about the types of actions that are excluded from the definition.</p>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Two commenters requested clarification regarding the imposition of CMPs
for failure to report. One commenter requested voluntary reporting of other adjudicated
actions, in the hopes of eliminating such penalties. Another commenter asks that we
include an intent clause as a necessary element to apply CMPs. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We disagree with the commenter's alternative approach regarding voluntary
reporting, which we believe to be inconsistent with Congress' intent in creating a CMP for
failure to report. In accordance with the statutory language that requires such action, a
health plan failing to report any &quot;other adjudicated actions or decisions&quot; could
be assessed a CMP of not more than $25,000. The regulations implementing this CMP
provision are not a direct part of this HIPDB implementing rule and are being addressed in
specific detail through separate OIG final rulemaking directed towards new or revised
exclusion and CMP authorities resulting from Public Law 105-33. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter requested clarification on whether all reportable
adjudicated actions must be related to professional competence or conduct. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The term &quot;other adjudicated actions or decisions&quot; does not need
to relate to professional competence or conduct However, such actions must relate to the
delivery of health care items or services. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters stated the definition should be limited to final
adverse actions involving a court or Government agency, in that reporting final
adjudicated actions in which there was no finding of liability will discourage
settlements; and adverse actions will vary from State to State, making it difficult to
analyze or standardize the reporting process. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We believe that the statutory language is clear about which entities are
required to report. Certain health plan actions will meet the criteria of &quot;other
adjudicated actions or decisions,&quot; and, therefore, will be reportable. The statute
also is clear that final actions resulting from settlements in which no findings of
liability have been made are not reportable. The OIG recognizes the variation among States
in the types of other adjudicated actions or decisions taken. We stress that the HIPDB is
intended as a &quot;flagging system&quot; and that the information in the HIPDB should
serve only to alert Federal and State agencies and health plans that there may be a
problem with a particular provider's, supplier's or practitioner's background. The HIPDB
information should be considered together with other relevant data in evaluating a
provider's, supplier's or practitioner's background. <br>
<br>
A hallmark of any valid adjudicated action or decision is the availability of a due
process mechanism. In general, if an &quot;adjudicated action or decision&quot; follows an
agency's established administrative procedures (that ensure that due process is available
to the subject of the final adverse action), it would qualify as a reportable action under
this definition. For example, a formal or official final action taken by a Federal or
State Government agency or health plan may include, but is not limited to, a
personnel-related action such as suspension without pay, reduction in grade for cause,
termination or other comparable action in connection with the delivery of a health care
item or service. For health plans that are not Government entities, an action taken
following adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing that meet the standards of due
process set forth in section 412(b) of the Health Care Quality and Improvement Act (42
U.S.C. 11112(b)) also will qualify as a reportable action under this definition. The fact
that the subject elects not to use the due process mechanism provided by the authority
bringing the action is immaterial, as long as such a process is available to the subject
before the adjudicated action or decision is made final. <br>
<br>
The revised definition for the term &quot;other adjudicated actions or decision&quot;
specifically excludes clinical privileging actions taken by Federal or State governmental
agencies, as well as the similar &quot;paneling actions&quot; taken by health plans. We
will not collect&quot;removal without cause&quot; actions taken by health plans, such as
when the health plan has to eliminate some of its specialists or when the health plan
concludes that a physician is not maintaining a desirable rate of patient visits. On the
other hand, health plans <u>will</u> report &quot;quality actions&quot; that include the
availability of a due process procedure, such as the formal removal of a physician for
problems based on quality of care or competence issues. Health plans also will report any
health care related civil judgments they obtain against a health care practitioner,
provider or supplier. The revised definition also clarifies that initial overpayment
determinations by HCFA contractors, and similar overpayment decisions made by health
plans, are not final, reportable actions. <br>
<br>
<b>13. Voluntary surrender of license or certification</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> We received several comments on the definition of &quot;voluntary
surrender of license or certification&quot; from a variety of State and local agencies,
private sector organizations and others. The majority of the commenters supported a
broader definition of the term. One commenter did not believe voluntary surrenders should
be included in the system because of added burden resulting from such action. Several
commenters requested that the OIG provide further clarification of the term in the final
regulations. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u><b> </b>In light of the strong support for the definition in the
proposed regulations, we are adopting this definition in the final rule with certain
clarifications. The OIG is aware that there are instances in which a voluntary surrender
is used to identify practitioners who are deceased, retired, have not renewed their
license or certification, or have simply moved out of the State. We are clarifying the
definition to exclude non-disciplinary voluntary surrenders. <br>
<br>
<u><b>Section 61.4</b> <b>How information must be reported</b></u><b>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> A number of commenters requested clarification on how information must be
reported to the HIPDB. These commenters generally requested additional information on how
electronic reporting would be accomplished, how consolidated reporting would occur for
both the HIPDB and the NPDB, and whether all reporters would have the appropriate software
and hardware to perform this function. Some commenters recommended, for example, that
reporters be permitted to submit files electronically using file transfer protocol or
electronic mail, and two commenters raised the issue of whether the HIPDB would accept
paper reports. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In response to these concerns, we are indicating in this final rule that
reports may be submitted to the HIPDB either through a secure interactive web-based
reporting service (using state-of-the-art encryption technology) or by mailing to the
HIPDB properly formatted report data on a diskette. Other types of electronic submissions
will <u>not</u> be accepted, nor will paper reports. Reporters who are required to submit
the same report to both the NPDB and the HIPDB will be able to satisfy their reporting
obligations by submitting their report only once. </p>

<p>Web-based reporting or querying will require a personal computer with a modem and
access to the Internet. We will provide technical details regarding required data formats
and access to the web site through technical manuals, guidebooks and on-line user help. We
believe that most reporters possess these basic tools required to gain access to the data
bank. We also recognize that there may be a small number of reporters who do not have
these capabilities, but these entities should be able to perform any required functions
through the services of an authorized agent, who would report to and query the data bank
on the entity's behalf. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter requested that the NPDB and the HIPDB be consolidated in
order to allow more efficient querying and reporting. The commenter also recommended
allowing queriers to use search engines to more efficiently locate information. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The issue of integrating the NPDB and HIPDB is addressed in greater
detail in section III. C. of this preamble, &quot;General Issues and Alternatives
Suggestions.&quot; In response to the commenter's recommendation regarding the use of
search engines for querying, queriers will be required to provide certain information
about a provider, supplier or practitioner in order to process their query. Specific
methods for querying will be addressed in subsequent guidance and technical documentation.
<br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> To reduce the possibility that non-relevant reports will be submitted to
the HIPDB, one commenter recommended that the Secretary establish a reporting threshold or
specific criteria for each type of report. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Through development of a policy guidance guidebook, the Department
intends to provide specific examples and establish the criteria for determining whether a
final adverse action meets the standards established in regulations. These criteria will
be specific to each type of action and will include examples of reportable and
non-reportable actions. It will be up to each reporter, however, to review, understand and
apply these criteria when reporting. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.5 When information must be reported</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Commenters recommended extending the 30-day period for reporting final
adverse actions to the HIPDB to 60 days. The commenters stated that the time frame set
forth in the proposed rule was too stringent and unrealistic to be met by State licensing
boards. Several associations representing State licensing boards suggested this time frame
would place significant burden on licensing boards. By extending the time frame from 30
days to 60 days, commenters indicated that licensing boards would have adequate time to
provide the information to their agent and, in turn, for the agent to submit the
information to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We are unable to make the changes suggested since the statutory language
requires reports to be submitted regularly, but not less often than monthly. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.6 Reporting errors, omissions, revisions or whether an action is on
appeal</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter stated that if a reportable adverse action is on appeal, the
action should not be reported until the appeal process is final; if the appeal reverses
the decision, then the entire report should be removed from the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We disagree with the first aspect of the comment since the statutory
language (section 1128E(b)(2)(C)) requires specifically that a statement as to whether the
action is on appeal must be included in the report to the HIPDB. With respect to the
second part of the commenter's concern, we agree that reports which have been reversed on
appeal will require a revision to the report. The report may be voided by the reporter at
the time of the revision.<em> </em><br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Some commenters stated that the reporting of revisions, such as a
reinstatement of a license, will cause confusion for queriers, that the accuracy of the
reports in the HIPDB will be compromised, and that reporters will abuse the system by
reporting &quot;indiscriminately&quot; to avoid a sanction for failing to report and
fulfilling the 30-day time frame. Commenters also expressed uncertainty as to who is
responsible for reporting the revision. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We believe that there is a misconception on the part of some of the
commenters. Specifically, when a reinstatement of a license occurs, the reporter must
submit a revision to an action regarding the reinstatement. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Two commenters raised concern over the fact that a subject of a report may
file a written statement to the HIPDB. The commenters believed this provision violates the
due process rights of the entity taking the action. In addition, these commenters were
concerned that the subject's statements could render an extremely inaccurate, biased and
unreliable report. One commenter requested that reports be deleted after a 5-year period
of time. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We note that only final adjudicated actions are reportable. The Act does
not provide for the removal of reports from the data bank except through the dispute
process. A subject's statement provides the subject with the opportunity to state his or
her views on the final adverse action report; the report and the addendum will be sent to
subsequent queriers. It is unclear what &quot;due process rights&quot; of the <u>reporting
entity</u> could be violated by giving the <u>subject</u> of a report the right to state
his or her views about the report. Further, we note that this approach parallels the
long-standing practice used in reporting to the NPDB. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.7 Reporting licensure actions taken by Federal or State licensing
and certification agencies</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters were concerned about the possibility of duplicative
reporting when a practitioner is licensed in more than one State.<b> </b>The
question was raised as to who reports the<b> </b>adverse licensing action<b>.</b>
Several commenters questioned the process for reporting reinstatement of a license. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute requires that the State taking the action is responsible for
reporting that action to the HIPDB. Each respective State licensure action requires a
separate report to HIPDB. This process of reporting parallels the approach taken under the
NPDB. The process for reporting reinstatement of a license is explained in the preamble
section discussing § 61.6. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> With respect to reporting actions on individuals, a number of comments
addressed the problem of collecting the mandatory and &quot;if known&quot; data elements. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We are addressing this issue below in section III. C. of this preamble. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters believed that the description of actions in this
section were too vague, and that the OIG should limit reportable actions to those that
truly limit practice, such as revocation, suspension and limitation on licensure. Another
commenter suggested the HIPDB should be collecting final adverse actions related only to
fraud and abuse in the delivery of a health care item or service. Two commenters
questioned whether censure letters and other <u>de minimis</u> sanctions are reportable
since these actions are not usually subject to due process, and recommended that we
include only actions taken against physicians holding full licenses to practice medicine. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Section 1128E(g)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act states that Federal and State
licensing and certification agencies must report to the HIPDB all of the following final
adverse actions that are taken against a health care provider, supplier or practitioner:
&nbsp; formal or official actions, such as revocation or suspension of a license (and
length of any such suspension ), reprimand, censure or probation; any other loss of the
license or the right to apply for, or renew, a license of a provider, supplier or
practitioner; and any other negative action or finding as defined by the Federal or State
agency. <br>
<br>
Under section 1128E of the Act, the only limitation on a reportable disciplinary action is
that it must be a formal or official action. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter believed that automatic suspension of a license for failure
to pay family support for a child or spouse, for example, should not be included as a
reportable event. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> While we are aware of other ways in which a license may be suspended or
revoked by other Federal laws not related to the HIPAA, this licensing action is
considered a disciplinary action and, in accordance with the statute's definition of final
adverse action, is reportable to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Concerning what information must be reported on organizations, one
commenter recommended that the actions reported by Federal and State licensing and
certification agencies be limited to those who traditionally provide these services. The
commenter believed that the combination of the definitions of &quot;supplier&quot; and
&quot;adverse action&quot; could lead to a data bank for reporting complaints and appeals,
and not fraudulent activities. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In accordance with these comments, we are modifying the definitions of
&quot;adverse actions&quot; and &quot;supplier&quot; in § 61.3 in order to collect
meaningful data on subjects of reportable final adverse actions. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several State licensing boards stated that they already report adverse
action information to their individual professional association, and several professional
associations also stated that they received reports from States on such actions. These
commenters believed that they should be exempt from reporting to the HIPDB. Another
commenter believed that HCFA should report all adverse actions to the HIPDB taken against
Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers based on information that is already
reported by State survey and certification agencies, thus leaving States with the
responsibility to report only adverse actions taken against an entity based on State law. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute does not provide an exclusion from reporting to the HIPDB for
individual professions that may report to other data banks. We encourage these
organizations to designate their professional associations to act as authorized agents
with the HIPDB. The statute requires that Federal and State Government agencies and health
plans report any adverse action taken against a health care provider, supplier or
practitioner. The OIG recognizes that State survey and certification agencies already
report their findings to HCFA and we will continue to work with HCFA to find methods of
streamlining and coordinating the reporting process. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.8 Reporting Federal or State criminal convictions related to the
delivery of a health care item or service</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter indicated that States already report convictions to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and, as such, reporting to the HIPDB would be
duplicative and costly. Another commenter requested clarification of the term
&quot;delivery.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The scope of the HIPDB goes beyond the felony convictions obtained at the
State and local level that are currently reported to the FBI. Information being reported
to the data bank also will include misdemeanor convictions, <u>nolo contendere</u> pleas,
and pre-trial diversions and similar actions, that are not reportable to the FBI. In
addition, the FBI does not classify convictions as being related to the delivery of a
health care item or service, nor does it classify those convicted individuals and entities
as being health care providers, suppliers or practitioners. Consequently, the FBI's data
bank does not contain every action that would be reportable to the HIPDB, nor does it
provide a way in which all appropriate State and local convictions could be identified for
use in the HIPDB. The term 'delivery&quot; includes, but is not limited to, participation
in any part of the provision for or payment of a health care item or service. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.9 Reporting civil judgments related to the delivery of a health care
item or service</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter was not clear as to when a health plan would be obligated to
report a civil action, and recommended that health plans only be required to report when
no Government agency was a party to the action. The commenter also suggested that health
plans should be able to assign responsibility for reporting to another entity, if the
other entity also were party to the suit. A second commenter believed that civil actions
are best reported by a prosecuting entity. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG does not require that each party to a civil action report that
action individually. However, to clarify who has the responsibility for reporting
multi-claimant civil judgments, we are adding new language to § 61.9 to address
responsibilities for the reporting of multi-claimant actions. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.10 Reporting exclusion from participation in Federal or State health
care programs</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter stated that the OIG did not provide adequate and clear
information for providers to use to identify excluded individuals or entities. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Revised OIG exclusion authorities were published as proposed rulemaking
in the <u>Federal Register</u> on September 8, 1997 (62 FR 47182), and final regulations
were published on September 2, 1998 (63 FR 46676). As indicated above in addressing the
definition of the term &quot;health care supplier,&quot;in the OIG's final rulemaking on
new exclusions and revised authorities resulting from HIPAA, the OIG has the authority to
exclude any individual or entity who directly or indirectly provides or supplies items or
services. The scope of this exclusion authority includes items or services manufactured,
distributed or otherwise provided by individuals or entities that do not directly submit
claims to Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs, but that supply items
or services to providers, suppliers or practitioners who submit claims to these programs
for such items or services. Therefore, the OIG has already established through that final
rule the conditions for excluding an individual and entity from a Federal or State health
care program. As such, we believe no further revisions or clarifications are necessary in
this final rule. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.12 Requesting information from the HIPDB</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters believed there should be public access to the HIPDB,
while other commenters stated that access to the HIPDB should be open only to those who
have the authority to take adverse actions. Additionally, citing the need to obtain the
information for screening and credentialing potential employees, several commenters
requested that hospitals also be able to request information. Several commenters also
expressed concern regarding the data elements to be included in the release of aggregate
data for research purposes. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> While the OIG actively supports legislative proposals for expanding
access to the HIPDB, the existing statute clearly limits access to the HIPDB to those
entities that meet the definition of Federal or State agency or a health plan. Under the
current statutory definition of entities having access, some hospitals will meet the
criteria and be in a position to request information from the HIPDB, while other hospitals
will not have access to the data bank. With regard to what data elements would be
included, the OIG is clarifying the language in the final rule, as is discussed later in
this preamble. <br>
<br>
As set forth in § 61.12, at the time subjects request information as part of a
&quot;self-query,&quot; the subjects will receive (1) any report(s) in the HIPDB specific
to them, and (2) a disclosure history from the HIPDB of the name(s) of any entity (or
entities) that have previously received the report(s). This disclosure history will be
restricted in accordance with revisions being made to the Department's Privacy Act
regulations at 45 CFR part 5b which, when issued in final form, will include an exemption
for law enforcement access of the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.13 Fees applicable to requests for information</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> The majority of the comments received on this section were from State
agencies. The commenters requested free or discounted rates for querying the HIPDB. The
commenters suggested that those State agencies that actually file reports with the HIPDB
should, in exchange, be able to query the data bank for free or at a discounted rate. One
commenter expressed a concern over having to pay a separate fee to query both the HIPDB
and the NPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG is aware of the concerns of some State agencies. The HIPDB and
the NPDB were established under separate statutes, each requiring a fee for querying. Each
data bank, by statute, was designed to recover its own cost through the imposition of
query fees. We are aware of the potential burden of dual querying and will make every
effort to keep these fees to a minimum. The OIG cannot comply with this request to offer
free or discounted queries to State agencies and others. Since the statute specifically
mandates that the Department exempt only Federal agencies from query fees, in order to
completely cover costs from paying customers, the OIG must charge all non-Federal
customers the same rate. <br>
<br>
The OIG intends to announce the actual amounts of the fees for the data bank in periodic
notices in the <u>Federal Register</u>. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter recommended that all Federal agencies also should be
subjected to a fee when querying the HIPDB, while another commenter stated that since
Federal agencies are exempted from paying fees, their access should be limited to
&quot;bona fide&quot; purposes. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> With regard to the one commenter's suggestion as to Federal agencies
fees, section 1128E(d)(2) of the Act specifically prevents the OIG from charging Federal
agencies a fee to query the HIPDB. The appropriate uses of HIPDB information for all
users, including Federal agencies, is being defined in § 61.14 of these regulations and
the Privacy Act System of Records notice published in the <u>Federal Register</u> on
February 16, 1999 (64 FR 7653). <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter recommended that the OIG not establish a fee for health care
practitioners, providers or suppliers requesting information about themselves
(self-queries) from the HIPDB. This commenter believed that State licensing boards will
&quot;game the system&quot; by requiring licensees to submit self-query responses when
requesting initial licensure or re-licensure. This commenter noted this type of activity
already occurs with the NPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Since State licensing boards are not required by the statute to query,
the OIG can not expressly mandate that they query the HIPDB directly in place of requiring
practitioners to provide self-query responses. However, we will make every effort to
strongly encourage State licensing boards to query the HIPDB <u>directly</u> to ensure
they receive accurate and complete information. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter asked that the HIPDB provide an automatic copy (without a
request and free of charge) of every report to the health care provider, supplier or
practitioner who is the subject of the report, and not just when the report is initially
entered into the HIPDB. This would include any report that is &quot;amended or
deleted.&quot; A second commenter recommended that the OIG add a sentence to the final
regulations stating that the HIPDB also will provide a copy of every HIPDB report
automatically, without a request and free of charge, to the reporter who submitted the
report. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We agree with these comments and will modify the final regulations
accordingly. The HIPDB will provide a copy of every HIPDB report to the reporter, as well
as to the health care provider, supplier, or practitioner who is the subject of the
report, when the report is initially entered. In addition, further notification will be
made to these parties whenever the report is corrected or revised, and whenever the report
is voided. We also agree to automatically provide the reporter with a copy of the revised
report, without further request. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.14 Confidentiality of the HIPDB information</u>.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> The majority of the commenters responding to this provision questioned the
confidentiality of the reported data bank elements and resulting privacy of the
information once a report is submitted to the HIPDB. The confidentiality of individual
elements, as well as of the report as a whole, were questioned and several commenters
believed the final rule needed to be clarified further. Citing possible violation of the
Privacy Act, commenters expressed concern about the &quot;purpose&quot; for which the data
are provided and the process of how queriers may distribute and use the information
provided in a report. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Similar to the NPDB, the HIPDB requires specific data elements to be
reported in order to maximize the accuracy of matching subjects of reports by the querier.
The Privacy Act of 1974 established the guidelines for Federal governmental systems of
records that are maintained by the names of individuals. The HIPDB was established as a
system of records subject to the Privacy Act by notice published in the <u>Federal
Register</u> on February 16, 1999 (64 FR 7653). Section 552(i)(3) of the Privacy Act
provides that obtaining information knowingly from an agency system of records under false
pretenses will be treated as a misdemeanor and will incur a fine of not more than $5,000
per occurrence. Section 552b(3) of the Privacy Act allows disclosure for &quot;routine
use,&quot; compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. Appropriate uses for
the HIPDB information will include credentialing and employment decisions, fraud and abuse
investigations, and use as a part of a querying entity's screening process which would
indicate more complete details are needed about the subject. This &quot;routine use&quot;
does not allow disclosure to the general public. We are clarifying this discussion in §
61.14 of the final regulations. <br>
<br>
We note that information which would identify Federal or State agency health program
beneficiaries, or other patients of providers or practitioners, is not reportable to the
HIPDB. Further, we will disallow references to individual patients or beneficiaries in any
rebuttal documents submitted as part of a report dispute process, or submitted as part of
the written comments that a subject may submit to be included with a report. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters stated that the wording of this section was confusing,
and did not fully explain the ways in which information can be disseminated once it is
released to an eligible entity. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> With respect to the confidentiality requirements of information obtained
from the HIPDB indirectly from another party, as well as information obtained directly
from the data bank, an individual or entity that receives information from the HIPDB is
permitted to disclose such information further in the course of carrying out the activity
for which the information was sought. For example, during the course of a health plan's
credentialing process, the plan may request information from the HIPDB on a practitioner's
history of final adverse actions. The health plan may share this information with other
individuals who are part of the credentialing review and decision making process on the
practitioner's application. Nevertheless, the confidentiality limitations of the Act apply
both to the health plan staff who initially receive the information and to the specific
departmental staff who subsequently review this same information; they may each only use
and disclose the information with respect to the credentialing decision. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Section 61.15 How to dispute the accuracy of the HIPDB information</u>. </b><br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters were supportive of the mechanism set forth in the
proposed rule that would allow practitioners to attach a 2,000 word statement to their
report for purposes of disputing the accuracy of HIPDB information. Some commenters
indicated that the inclusion of a 2,000 word statement to a report was unnecessary and
recommended eliminating this provision for the final rule. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u><b> </b>We believe this mechanism will be useful, and are
retaining it in the final regulations. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> While some commenters believed a dispute mechanism was unnecessary or
would greatly increase the burden on reporting entities, other commenters supported the
inclusion of an additional dispute mechanism under which reporting entities could report
disagreements with a Secretarial decision to delete a report from the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute specifically requires that the HIPDB have a dispute mechanism
in place. We are adopting the dispute mechanism that currently is being used for reports
to the NPDB, which has proven to be effective. We are addressing regulatory burden issues
later in this preamble. <br>
<br>
<b><u>C. General Issues and Alternative Suggestions</u></b> <br>
<br>
<b><u>1. Coordination and distinctions between the HIPDB and the NPDB</u></b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter stated that an additional data bank was unnecessary. The
commenter believed that the NPDB is adequate, and that the HIPDB will only serve to be
duplicative in nature. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> While we agree that the NPDB is adequate for its intended purpose of
protecting the public from incompetent or unprofessional health care practitioners, the
HIPDB reflects separate and distinct congressional intent, with unique data elements. The
HIPDB data base is intended to collect a wide range of final adverse actions. The HIPDB
serves a dual purpose of protecting the public, and assisting fraud and abuse
investigations of health care practitioners, suppliers and providers. The HIPDB also
contains information that is not reported to the NPDB, for purposes of meeting its
intended statutory objectives. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Some commenters expressed a desire that the HIPDB and the NPDB be combined
into one system, and commenters believed that for reports required under both systems, the
OIG should have reporters report such actions only once. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Although the HIPDB and the NPDB must be separate data banks, and serve
different purposes, the HIPDB and the NPDB will, for certain reporting and querying
purposes, form an integrated system, whereby a report required under both systems will
only need to be reported once. The system will subsequently store the report in the HIPDB,
the NPDB, or both, as appropriate. Additionally, a querier eligible to have access to both
data banks can query both through a single request. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter expressed concern that under an integrated reporting system
for the NPDB and the HIPDB a medical malpractice insurer would be forced to submit certain
fields required under the HIPDB, such as for an individual's Social Security Number. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> This provision is only applicable to reports required under <u>both</u>
data banks. For example, medical malpractice payment reports are only required to be
reported to the NPDB; they are statutorily <u>exempt</u> from HIPDB reporting. Therefore,
the HIPDB data elements required, such as an individual's Social Security Number, do not
apply to those reports. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter expressed a desire that actions taken before August 21,
1996, the effective date of the HIPAA statute, be required to be reported to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Since the Department does not have the statutory authority to
retroactively require reports before the statute's date of enactment, we cannot accept
this recommendation, and we would be unwilling to impose the burden of retroactive
reporting on the reporting entities even if we had the authority to do so. <br>
<br>
<b><u>2. Immunity provisions under the HIPDB</u> </b><br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> More than half of the comments received regarding immunity provision under
the HIPDB stated that any immunity provisions must be included within the final
regulations and not merely alluded to in the preamble. The commenters specifically
requested immunity with regard to submitting reports to the HIPDB. Several commenters
stated that any immunity provisions included within the final regulations needed to
specifically provide immunity for agents. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We agree with the comments, and are adding a new § 61.16 within the
final regulations to address this concern. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Three commenters were supportive of the proposed definition for the term
&quot;knowledge of falsity&quot; to mean actual knowledge of falsity by the submitting
party. One commenter requested the elimination of immunity for those who file information
with the HIPDB recklessly. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The intention of the statute is to encourage final adverse actions to be
reported against subjects, without fear of the subject retaliating with a lawsuit against
those who report the action. In accordance with the comments and the statute, we will
continue to interpret the term &quot;knowledge of falsity&quot; to mean actual
acknowledge. Consequently, we are including language in the final regulations stating that
the submitting reporter will not be immune from liability if there is actual knowledge of
falsity of a report. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter stated the subject of a report should be required to follow
the dispute resolution procedures before filing suit against a reporter for false
knowledge in reporting to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We decline to accept this comment. The statute does not provide the
authority to require the subject of a report to follow the dispute resolution procedures
prior to filing suit against a reporter. Further, we believe this would result in
unnecessary delays in reporting final adverse actions to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<b><u>3.</u></b> <b><u>Sanctions for failure to report</u></b> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> With regard to sanctions for failure to report to the HIPDB, commenters
stated that a potential CMP of $25,000 per occurrence against health plans that fail to
report was too severe. One commenter recommended that, because of the perceived breadth
and ambiguity of the reporting requirements, the OIG should only assess CMPs against
health plans that &quot;knowingly and willfully fail to report.&quot; Another commenter
stated that the CMP was proportionately unfair to single service health plans. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Section 4331 of Public Law 105-33, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997,
authorizes a CMP of <u>up to</u> $25,000 for each adverse action not reported by a health
plan. The statute does not require that this full amount be imposed; a lesser penalty
could be assessed at the discretion of the OIG. The statute does not require a
&quot;knowing and willful&quot; standard as part of the CMP criteria. However, the OIG has
discretion in choosing whether to assess a CMP, and the OIG applies various mitigating and
aggravating factors, as set forth in the OIG/CMP regulations, in determining the CMP
amount up to the $25,000 limit. Specific policies and factors regarding imposition of this
CMP are being set forth by the OIG in separate final rulemaking addressing new and revised
sanction authorities resulting from the BBA. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter asked whether the OIG would impose CMPs against health plans
that cannot report because they do not collect all of the reportable data elements. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> Every effort has been made to specify a set of data elements that will
not impose an undue burden on reporters and that still ensure a high degree of confidence
in matching names of health care practitioners, providers and suppliers with existing
reports in the HIPDB. Reporters will be required to report mandatory data elements, and
may report all other fields if they are known. However, reporters that fail to submit
reports with the minimum mandatory data required by statute and regulations may be subject
to the sanctions referenced above. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Some commenters expressed concern that the OIG would impose CMPs for the
non-reporting of adverse actions (or particular data elements associated with an adverse
action) that occurred during the period between the effective date of HIPAA, August 21,
1996, and the effective date of this rule, a time period when the exact reporting
requirements of the rule were not yet known to the entities now responsible for reporting.
<br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The basic types of actions to be reported were specified in the HIPAA and
were, therefore, noticed to potential reporters as of August 21, 1996. We do realize,
however, that the specific definitions of terms used, and the specification of exact data
elements to be reported, are set forth in this rule. While there is a duty to report
actions (and data elements) dating from the period between August 21, 1996 and the
promulgation of this rule, the OIG will give due consideration to the ability of a
reporting agency or health plan to comply with requirements to report such actions (and
data elements) in determining whether to impose a CMP for failure to report in accordance
with 42 CFR 1003.102(b)(5)(ii). <br>
<br>
<u>4. Implementation schedule</u> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Four comments were received regarding the implementation schedule for the
HIPDB. Commenters stated that collecting data elements retroactively, as required by the
Act, would be burdensome and difficult to obtain. One commenter recommended a separate
date for &quot;other adjudicated actions,&quot; stating that these actions are not final
until each case has exhausted all appeal rights. Several commenters suggested the OIG
should allow for two different dates: one for data that are available at the time of the
opening of the data bank, and another date (for example, 60 days later) for additional and
retroactive data. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG has taken these points into consideration. This concern is being
addressed below in the section of this preamble discussing the burden of data collection. <br>
<br>
<b><u>5. Paperwork Reduction Act statement</u></b> <br>
<br>
a. <u>Data elements to be reported to the HIPDB</u>. <br>
<br>
The OIG solicited comments on: (1) whether the proposed collection of information is
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Department, including whether
the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the Department's estimate
of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality,
utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the
burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of
automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Over half of the comments received concerned the data elements in general.
Commenters stated that the proposed rule was overreaching the scope of the statute and
created unintended reporting burdens with regard to the various data elements specified
for collection. Some commenters indicated that they did not collect one or more of the
required data elements, while others suggested that not all of the requested data elements
were necessary for the HIPDB, or that only a minimal set of elements were needed to insure
proper identification of a subject. </p>

<p>Some commenters stated that the required data elements would force physicians to devote
additional time and expense to reporting these actions. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The OIG disagrees with the commenters' assessments. The OIG continues to
believe the data elements selected for inclusion into the HIPDB are essential for users in
properly identifying individuals and entities which are the subjects of reports in the
data bank. Further, as indicated earlier, with respect to the concerns indicated by some
physicians, there are <u>no</u> requirements for physicians to report directly to the data
bank and thus no additional non-medical time required of them with respect to the array of
data elements. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> A number of State agencies cited their respective State statutes that
prohibit the collection or reporting of Social Security Numbers and, in some instances,
other personal data (such as sex and date of birth). Ten commenters stated that their
organizations did not routinely collect Social Security Numbers or Taxpayer Identification
Numbers. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute offers the OIG no discretion in this collection element
provision. The Federal statute authorizing this data base takes precedence over and
preempts State statutory requirements, and specifically requires the reporting of Taxpayer
Identification Numbers, which includes Social Security Numbers and Federal Employer
Identification Numbers. As to the inclusion of other personal identifiers, we have
determined that these elements are required to insure proper identification of subjects
reported to the data bank and, consequently, these requirements are being retained in the
final regulations. We believe that the various reporting entities can make the proper
adjustments to secure the required information without undue hardship or burden. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Some commenters raised concern over the need to include
&quot;Occupation&quot; as one of the mandatory element under the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u><b> </b>For identification purposes, we believe it is important
for a querier of the data bank to know a subject's occupation. Today's health care
providers are frequently involved in different ventures and occupations. Reportable
actions may arise in one area of a subject's endeavors, but not in others. Therefore, we
believe that queriers must be made aware of all reportable actions against a subject, and
an integral element of this is learning the occupation in which these actions were taken. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Three commenters requested that &quot;Other Names Used&quot; be a
mandatory field, particularly with regard to female subjects. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We are satisfied that this element should be reported &quot;if
known,&quot; and we assume the reporters will provide these names if such information is
available to them. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> We received comments regarding the &quot;Physician Specialty&quot; data
element. Commenters questioned why specialty data were only being collected on physicians
and not on other types of practitioners. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u><b> </b>We agree with the suggestion that &quot;specialty&quot;
should be reported for <u>all</u> practitioners, if applicable, and are modifying the
regulations accordingly. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Twenty-six commenters suggested that the &quot;Name of the Affiliated or
Associated Health Care Entity&quot; not be made a mandatory field. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute requires that this information be reported &quot;if
known.&quot; We agree with the commenters' concerns, and will clarify the language in the
final regulations to emphasize that this information be reported only if known. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several comments stated that potential reporters do not currently collect
the mandatory element &quot;National Provider Identifier&quot; (NPI). <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We are aware that NPIs have not been issued and, therefore, cannot be
reported. However, once HCFA issues these identification numbers, the collection and
reporting of NPIs to the HIPDB will be mandatory. Reporters are advised to begin the
necessary steps to collect this identifier in the future, as it becomes available. In this
final rule, we are deleting the data field &quot;NPI for Affiliated or Associated Health
Care Entities.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> One commenter suggested that the HIPDB also add the method used to detect
the act that underlies the action being reported. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> We disagree. We believe this information will not be useful, and would
create an additional reporting burden. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Commenters stated that some reporters do not collect data on the
&quot;Name of Each Professional School Attended and Year of Graduation.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> These data are mandatory requirements of the NPDB and are routinely
provided by State agencies and organizations representing physicians and dentists. These
NPDB requirements will remain unchanged. For reports made solely to the HIPDB, these data
elements will be mandatory for licensing and certification actions reported by Federal and
State agencies, which routinely collection this information, and will be designated as
&quot;if known&quot; for all other reporters. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment</u>: Several commenters noted the unreliability of a &quot;Work Address&quot;
element for individual subjects, and other commenters stated that only an &quot;Address of
Record&quot; would be known by certain reporters. <br>
<br>
<u>Response</u>: The OIG agrees with these comments and is revising the final regulations
accordingly. Only one address -- either the subject's &quot;Home Address&quot; or the
&quot;Address of Record&quot; -- will be mandatory for each report. Other addresses, such
as a primary work address, will be reportable only &quot;if known.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Twelve comments were received concerning the mandatory &quot;Description
of the Acts or Omissions&quot; and the &quot;Description of the Action&quot; fields. The
commenters suggested use of numerical codes in lieu of narrative descriptions. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> The statute is clear that the &quot;Description of the Acts or
Omissions&quot; field is a mandatory element. However, to assist users of this
information, we are adopting the suggestion of a code list that corresponds to the most
common underlying acts expected to be reported. Use of this code will be mandatory, along
with a narrative description of the acts or omissions and injuries upon which the reported
action was based. With regard to the &quot;Description of the Action&quot; field, we have
changed the final rule to show that the mandatory requirements for reporting an action are
the date the action was taken, its effective date and duration, the amount of any monetary
penalty, and whether the action is on appeal. We believe these elements are essential for
a user's understanding of the action being reported. The proposed rule also called for a
mandatory &quot;Classification of the action&quot; in accordance with a reporting code
adopted by the Secretary. While the &quot;Description of the action&quot; has been
deleted, the &quot;Action code&quot; will remain as a mandatory element in the final
regulations. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Five comments were received requesting additional clarification regarding
the reporting of &quot;Professional license, certification or registration.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In response to these comments, we are clarifying the final regulations to
indicate that for licensure certification or registration actions taken by Federal and
State licensing and certification agencies, the mandatory information to be reported will
be on the professional license, certification or registration on which the action was
taken. Information on other licenses, certifications or registrations, including those
issued in other States or by other agencies, will be reportable to the data bank &quot;if
known.&quot; <br>
<br>
b. <u>Estimated burden of data collection requirements</u> <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> A number of commenters stated that the proposed rule did not accurately
address the burden as it applies to the cost of creating and maintaining the data
collection system, or the costs associated with collecting the required data elements.
Commenters stated that the start-up cost, indicated at $5,000, was significantly
underestimated. One commenter strongly believed that the costs associated with the HIPDB
system would far outweigh its benefit, and several commenters stated that they would need
to hire new employees in order to meet the HIPDB reporting requirements. One commenter
indicated that, while their State proportionally had a smaller number of health care
providers than some of the larger States, its State agency nevertheless took 712 actions
last year that would need to be reported to the HIPDB, resulting in what they believed
would be a larger than estimated burden nationwide. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In developing our burden statement and estimate, calculations for the
regulatory impact statement in the proposed rule were based on estimations derived from
the regulatory impact prepared for the proposed rule currently being developed for State
licensing boards addressing section 1921 of the Act. Section 1921 of the Act, as amended
by section 5(b) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987
and by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, requires each State to adopt a
system that reports to the Secretary certain adverse licensure actions taken against
health care practitioners and health care entities that are licensed or otherwise
authorized by a State (or a political subdivision) to provide health care services.
Similar to the information required for the HIPDB, section 1921 of the Act already
requires, for reporting to the NPDB, that each State (1) report any negative actions or
findings that a State licensing authority, peer review organization or private
accreditation entity takes against a health care practitioner or health care entity; and
(2) have an information reporting system in place as of January 1, 1992, <u>regardless of
whether the Secretary promulgated regulations to carry out these provisions</u>.
Therefore, since 1992, the States already have been required to collect much of the
information to which they attribute their costs of collecting information for reporting to
the HIPDB. However, we recognize that the regulatory impact will vary from State to State,
and as a result, we have adjusted our burden estimates in this final rule accordingly.
Specifically, after consideration of the concerns raised, we agree with the commenters
that their developing or restructuring of a data collection system to incorporate the
HIPDB requirements may have been underestimated. Therefore, we have increased the start-up
cost estimate to $20,000 for each State licensing board. In terms of the reporting burden
for State licensing agencies, we were advised by national organizations that represent
State licensing boards that much of the requested data are already being collected and
maintained by their organization. Therefore, we believe that the reporting burden for
State licensing boards, such as nursing, chiropractic, optometry, physical therapist and
social worker should be minimal. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Some commenters believed that complying with the HIPDB would be labor
intensive and costly. Commenters suggested that the HIPDB data collection requirements
would create an administrative burden for State licensing boards. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> As indicated above, the OIG has addressed the reporting requirements in
detail in this preamble in response to public comments. We agree with many of the
commenters' concerns, and are streamlining the HIPDB reporting requirements accordingly.
The OIG believes that this final rule now reflects the least burdensome reporting
requirements possible with respect to State agencies' compliance. <br>
<br>
<u>Comment:</u> Several commenters proposed alternatives that they believed might ease the
burden on State licensing boards. Specifically, commenters recommended that the OIG make
use of various authorized agents, such as the National Council of State Boards of Nursing,
Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
and the American Association of State Social Work Boards to collect and report the
required information, thus lessening the burden on individual health plans and State
agencies. <br>
<br>
<u>Response:</u> In developing this rulemaking, the OIG sought the input from States and
representatives of various associations. Initially, the OIG met with State regulatory
boards and associations, including the National Council of State Boards of Nursing,
Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
and the American Association of State Social Work Boards, to explain the requirements of
the HIPDB and to explore options that would ease the regulatory burden on State agencies.
As a result with respect to State licensing boards, we suggested the following options:
(1) organizing a centralized or decentralized reporting mechanism within the State, or (2)
reporting to the data bank through an authorized agent. If an authorized agent is utilized
by the State, individual agreements must be made between the State and the professional
association, as well as between the State and the HIPDB.</p>

<p align="center"><b>IV. Summary of Revisions in the Final Rule</b></p>

<p>Based on our review and response to the array of public comments, and based on the
discretionary authority given the Department under the statute, we are making the
following revisions to the proposed regulations that we believe will allow the collection
and dissemination of information to and from the HIPDB to occur in a more effective and
efficient manner: <br>
<br>
<u>Section 61.3</u> <br>
<br>
We are revising the definition of the term &quot;Affiliated or associated&quot; to read as
follows: </p>

<p><u>Affiliated or Associated</u> means health care entities with which a subject of a
final adverse action has a commercial business relationship, including but not limited to,
organizations, associations, corporations, or partnerships. It also includes a
professional corporation or other business entity composed of a single individual. </p>

<p>In the definition of the term &quot;Any other negative action or finding,&quot; we are
adding the following sentence: &quot;This definition excludes<b> </b>administrative
fines or citations and corrective action plans, unless they are: (1) connected to the
delivery of health care services, and (2) taken in conjunction with other licensure or
certification actions such as revocation, suspension, censure, reprimand, probation, or
surrender.&quot; </p>

<p>We are deleting the proposed definition for the term &quot;Clinical privileges.&quot; </p>

<p>We are amending the fourth element in the definition of the term &quot;Government
agency&quot; to include both Federal and State law enforcement agencies, and law
enforcement investigators as well as States Attorneys General. </p>

<p>In the first sentence under the definition for the term &quot;Health care
supplier,&quot; we have inserted a comma and are adding the phrase &quot;whether directly
or indirectly,&quot; after the statement &quot;...or any individual or entity, other than
a provider, who furnishes&quot;<b> </b>and we have replaced the example of
&quot;manufacturers of health care related items&quot; with the phrase &quot;manufacturers
of health care items.&quot; We have also revised the second sentence in the definition to
read as follows: &quot;The term also includes any individual or entity under contract to
provide such supplies, items or ancillary services, health plans as defined in this
section (excluding employers that are not self-insured) and health insurance producers
(including, but not limited to, agents, brokers, solicitors, consultants and reinsurance
intermediaries).&quot; </p>

<p>We are modifying the fourth element in the proposed definition of the term &quot;Health
plan&quot; to make the definition more inclusive. As revised the fourth element will
include, but not be limited to, &quot;[A] plan, program, agreement or other mechanism
established, maintained or made available by a self insured employer or group of self
insured employers, a practitioner, provider or supplier group, third party administrator,
integrated health care delivery system, employee welfare association, public service group
or organization or professional association...&quot; </p>

<p>We are adding a definition for the term &quot;Organizational name and type.&quot; The
&quot;organization name&quot; data element, to be reported for all types of actions
described in §§ 61.7, 61.8, 61.9, 61.10 and 61.11, means the subject's business or
employer at the time the underlying acts occurred. If more than one business or employer
is involved, the one most closely related to the underlying acts must be reported in
&quot;organization name,&quot; with the others being reported in the &quot;affiliated or
associated health care entities&quot; field. The &quot;organization type&quot; is a brief
description of the nature of that business or employer. </p>

<p>The definition for &quot;Other adjudicated actions or decisions&quot; specifically
excludes clinical privileging actions taken by Federal or State governmental agencies,
paneling decisions made by health plans and overpayment determinations by Federal and
State agency contractors or by health plans. </p>

<p>We are also adding a new definition for the term &quot;Voluntary surrender&quot; to
mean a surrender made after a notification of investigation or a formal official request
by Federal or State licensing or certification authorities for a health care provider,
supplier, or practitioner to surrender the license or certification (including
certification agreements or contracts for participation in Federal or State health care
programs). The definition also includes those instances where a health care provider,
supplier or practitioner voluntarily surrenders a license or certification (including
program participation agreements or contracts) in exchange for a decision by the licensing
or certification authority to cease an investigation or similar proceeding, or in return
for not conducting an investigation or proceeding, or in lieu of a disciplinary action. <br>
<br>
<u>Section 61.9</u> </p>

<p>With regard to reporting civil judgments related to the delivery of a health care item
or service, we are adding the following language to § 61.9(a): &quot;If a Government
agency is party to a multi-claimant civil judgment, it must assume the responsibility for
reporting the entire action, including all amounts awarded to all the claimants, both
public and private. If there is no Government agency as a party, but there are multiple
health plans as claimants, the health plan which receives the largest award must be
responsible for reporting the total action for all parties.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Section 61.12</u> </p>

<p>With regard to requesting information from the HIPDB, we are revising the first
sentence in § 61.12 (a)(4) to indicate that information in the data bank will be
available, upon request, to &quot;[A] person or entity who requests statistical
information, which does not permit any personal identifiers for any individual or
entity.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Section 61.13</u> </p>

<p>We are adding the following sentence to the end of § 61.13 (a) with regard to our
policy on fees applicable to requests for information: &quot;For the same purpose, the
Department will provide a copy of the report -- automatically, without a request and free
of charge -- to the reporter that submitted it.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Data elements to be reported to the HIPDB</u> <br>
<br>
In view of the comments and responses discussed above, and in an effort to clarify
reporting requirements, the data elements have been reformatted. Sections 61.7, 61.8,
61.9, 61.10 and 61.11 are structured as follows: </p>

<p>The actions which must be reported and who is responsible for making those reports. The
mandatory personal identifiers and employment or professional identifiers for individual
subjects; the mandatory identifiers for organization subjects; and the mandatory data
elements for all subjects relating to the acts or omissions, the action taken and the
reporting entity. </p>

<p>The &quot;if known&quot; personal identifiers and employment or professional
identifiers for individual subjects; the &quot;if known&quot; identifiers for organization
subjects; and the &quot;if known&quot; data elements for all subjects relating to the acts
or omissions, and the action taken. </p>

<p>Each section concludes with the sanctions for failure to report. <br>
<br>
<u>Section 61.16</u> </p>

<p>We are adding a new § 61.16 <u>Immunity</u>, to indicate that individuals, entities or
their authorized agents and the HIPDB will not be held liable in any civil action filed by
the subject of a report unless the individual, entity or their authorized agent submitting
the report has actual knowledge of falsity of the information contained in the report. </p>

<p align="center"><b>V. Regulatory Impact Statement</b></p>

<p><u>Executive Order 12866, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act</u> <br>
<br>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed this final rule in accordance with
the provisions of Executive Order 12866, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and has determined that it does not meet
the criteria for a significant regulatory action. <br>
<br>
Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when rulemaking is necessary, to select regulatory approaches
that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health,
safety, distributive and equity effects). The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Public Law
104-4, requires that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits on
any rulemaking that may result in an annual expenditure by State, local or tribal
government, or by the private sector of $100 million or more. In addition, under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities, the Secretary must specifically consider the economic effect of
a rule on small entities and analyze regulatory options that could lessen the impact of
the rule. <br>
<br>
Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives,
costs, benefits, incentives, equity, and available information. Regulations must meet
certain standards, such as avoiding unnecessary burden. Regulations that are
&quot;significant&quot; because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency
with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require
special analysis. The resources required to implement the requirements in this final rule
are minimal. We have determined that this final rule does not meet the criteria for a
major rule, as defined by Executive Order 12866. As indicated above, this final rule is
designed to establish procedures for reporting to and releasing from the HIPDB information
on health care providers, suppliers, or practitioners against whom final adverse actions
have been taken. <br>
<br>
In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, we have determined the only
costs (which we believe will not be significant) would include the ability to transmit the
information electronically (e.g., Internet service) and additional staff hours needed to
transmit the information. Based on the public comments, we have increased the initial
start-up cost from $5,000 to $20,000 per State licensing and certification agency ($20,000
per State licensing and certification agency x 216 State agencies = $4,320,000). The
Department determined that the initial start-up cost will be less than $100 per health
plan ($100 per health plan x 20,000 health plans = $2,000,000). Section 221(a) of HIPAA
intends that the Federal Government will not incur any costs for the operation and
maintenance of the HIPDB; user fees are intended to cover the full costs of the HIPDB. For
the reasons stated above, the Department has determined that this rule does not impose any
mandates on State, local or tribal governments, or the private sector that will result in
an annual expenditure of $100 million or more, and that a full analysis under the Act is
not necessary. <br>
<br>
In addition, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), and the
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996, which amended the RFA, we are required
to determine if this rule will have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities and, if so, to identify regulatory options that could lessen the impact.
For purposes of this final rule, we have not categorized health plans as small business
entities in accordance with the RFA, nor have we included individuals and States in this
definition of small entities. Rather, we have defined small entities as nonprofit
organizations and local government agencies. Although the statute does not specify local
government agencies as reporters, we also have given States the option to decide the
manner in which they will report, i.e., having one centralized point for reporting or
having multiple agencies such as municipalities and local government agencies (including
District and County attorneys) report independently to the HIPDB. If States elect to have
multiple agencies reporting independently to the HIPDB, we have determined that both the
burden and costs associated with reporting to the HIPDB will be minimal. We also have
determined that this rule would affect less than 100 nonprofit and local government
agencies. Also with respect to health plans, we have determined that the burden and cost
to them will be minimal. In an effort to reduce the reporting and impact burdens upon
health plans, we have, as indicated above, clarified the definition of the term
&quot;other adjudicated actions or decisions&quot; to emphasize that such an action
requires the availability of a due process mechanism. We have in the rule specifically
limited the types of actions that health plans will be required o report to a more limited
and narrower category of actions. We are not preparing an analysis for the RFA, since we
have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, in accordance with the
threshold criteria of Executive Order 13132 (August 4, 1999), have determined that these
regulations do not significantly affect the rights, roles and responsibilities of States. <br>
<br>
<u>Paperwork Reduction Act</u> <br>
<br>
In compliance with section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PWA) of 1995, we
are required to solicit public comments, and receive final OMB approval, on any
information collection requirements set forth in final rulemaking. As indicated above, in
order to properly implement the HIPDB, the OIG requires the collection of certain
information as set forth in §§ 61.6, 61.7, 61.8, 61.9, 61.11, 61.12 and 61.15 of this
final rule. In accordance with the PWA, we are submitting to OMB at this time the
following requirements for seeking emergency review of these provisions. We are requesting
an emergency review because the data collection and reporting of this information is
needed before the expiration of the normal time limits under OMB's regulations at 5 CFR
part 1320, to ensure the timely availability and reporting of data as necessary in order
to improve the quality of patient care and to prevent health care fraud and abuse
activities. Delaying the reporting process would delay implementation of the establishment
of a complete data bank that effectively deters health care fraud and abuse in the health
care industry and protects the public. We are requesting OMB review and approval of this
collection within 16 working days from the date of publication of this rulemaking, with a
180-day approval period. Written comments and recommendations will be accepted from the
public if received by the individual designated below within 15 working days from the dat
of publication of these regulations. During this 180-day approval period, we will publish
a separate <u>Federal Register</u> notice announcing the initiation of an extensive 60-day
agency review and public comment period on the requirements set forth. <br>
<br>
<b>Collection of Information:</b> The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data
Bank for Final Adverse Information on Health Care Providers, Suppliers and Practitioners. <br>
<br>
<b>Description</b>: Information collected under §§ 61.6, 61.7, 61.8, 61.9,
61.11, 61.12 and 61.15 of this final rule would be used by authorized parties, specified
in the proposed rule, to prevent health care fraud and abuse activities and to improve the
quality of patient care. <br>
<br>
<b>Description of Respondents:</b> Federal and State Government agencies and
health plans. The reports from Federal agencies are not subject to the PRA. <br>
<br>
<b>Estimated Annual Reporting:</b> The Department estimates that the public
reporting burden for this final rule is 185,099 hours. As a result of the public comments,
we acknowledge that the proposed rule significantly under estimated the number of
licensure and certification actions taken by State licensing authorities against health
care providers, suppliers and practitioners. Therefore, we have increased the reporting
burden from 132,733 to 185,099 hours. <br>
<br>
The estimated annual reporting and querying burden is as follows: <br>

<p>Allison Herron Eydt, OIG Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235, New
Executive Office Building, 725 17<sup>th</sup> Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20053, FAX:
(202) 395-6974. <br>
<br>
<u>Footnotes:</u> </p>

<p><a name="1"></a>1. Section 61.6 requires each Government agency or health plan 
  that reports information to the HIPDB to ensure the accuracy of the information. 
  If there are any errors or omissions to the reports previously submitted to 
  the HIPDB, the individual or entity that submitted the report to the HIPDB is 
  also responsible for making the necessary correction or revision to the original 
  report. If there is any revision to the action or the action is on appeal, the 
  individual or entity that submitted the original report to the HIPDB is also 
  responsible for reporting revisions and whether the action is on appeal. Based 
  on corrections and revisions made to information contained in the NPDB, we have 
  estimated that a total of 1,200 respondents will need to correct their reports 
  each year and that a total of 1,000 respondents will need to revise actions 
  originally reported, or to report whether an action is on appeal each year. 
  Based on experience with the NPDB, a correction is expected to take 25 minutes 
  to complete and submit. A revision is expected to take somewhat longer (75 minutes) 
  because it involves completing a new report form rather that just correcting 
  the individual items that are in error. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="2"></a>2. Section 61.7 requires Federal and State agencies responsible 
  for the licensing and certification of health care providers, suppliers and 
  practitioners to report all disciplinary licensure actions to the HIPDB. Therefore, 
  we estimate that approximately 34 State licensing boards in each State will 
  report to the State licensing and certification authorities (54 States and territories 
  x 34 licensing boards/per State = 1,836 State licensing and certification boards), 
  and the State licensing and certification authorities (4 per State) will be 
  responsible for reporting information to the HIPDB (54 States and territories 
  x 4 State licensing and certification authorities/per State = 216 State licensing 
  and certification authorities). We estimate that 40,400 reports will be submitted 
  directly to the HIPDB each year, for an average of 187 reports per State licensing 
  and certification authority and 22 reports per State licensing board. Since 
  disciplinary licensure actions by State licensing authorities in the NPDB overlap 
  with this statute, this estimate includes all licensure actions that will be 
  reported to both the NPDB and the HIPDB. The HIPDB will use similar forms and 
  procedures for reporting as the NPDB. As a result, we estimate that it will 
  take a State licensing board 75 minutes to complete and submit an initial report. 
  We also estimate that it will take a State licensing and certification authority 
  15 minutes to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information contained 
  in the initial report before electronically submitting the information to the 
  HIPDB. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="3"></a>3. Section 61.8 requires Federal and State prosecutors to report 
  criminal convictions related to the delivery of a health care item or service. 
  Based on the number of health care providers, suppliers and practitioners convicted 
  by the Federal Government, we estimate that there will be an approximate total 
  of 700 State criminal convictions reported to the HIPDB each year, for an average 
  of 13 convictions per State. Based on experience with the NPDB, we estimate 
  that it will take 75 minutes to complete and submit each report. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="4"></a>4. Section 61.9 requires Federal and State attorneys and health 
  care plans to report civil judgments against health care providers, suppliers 
  and practitioners related to the delivery of a health care item or service. 
  We estimate that there will be an approximate total of 500 civil judgments each 
  year that will be reported by the 54 States Attorneys and an estimated 8 health 
  plans, for a total of 62 reporters. Based on experience with the NPDB, we estimate 
  that it will take 75 minutes to complete and submit each report. </p>

<p><a name="5"></a>5. Section 61.11 requires Federal and State Governmental agencies 
  and health plans to report any adjudicated action or decision related to the 
  delivery of a health care item or service against health care providers, suppliers 
  and practitioners. We estimate that there will be an approximate total of 800 
  other adjudicated actions or decision reports submitted to the HIPDB each year 
  by 54 State governmental agencies and an estimated 12 health plans, for a total 
  of 66 reporters. Based on experience with the NPDB, we estimate that it will 
  take 75 minutes to complete and submit each report. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="6"></a>6. Certain queriers have access to both the NPDB and the HIPDB. 
  When these entities query one data bank, they may elect to automatically receive 
  reports from both. The Department estimates that there will be 1,127,512 queries 
  submitted to the HIPDB per year on health care providers, suppliers and practitioners, 
  including an estimated 60,000 self-queries. These estimates include only queries 
  submitted directly to the HIPDB; it does not include those transferred from 
  the NPDB. The estimates of burden per response are based on experience with 
  similar querying of the NPDB. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="7"></a>7. To access the HIPDB, entities are required to certify that 
  they meet section 1128E reporting and querying requirements by completing an 
  Entity Registration form and submitting it to the HIPDB. The information collected 
  on this form provides the HIPDB with essential information concerning the entity, 
  such as name, address and entity type. Eligible entities, such as State licensing 
  agencies or certain managed care organizations, that have access to both the 
  NPDB and the HIPDB have already registered for the NPDB and are not required 
  to register separately for the HIPDB. Entities eligible to access only the HIPDB 
  must complete and submit the Entity Registration form. We estimate that it will 
  take an entity 10 minutes to complete and submit the Entity Registration form 
  to the HIPDB. If there are any changes in the entity's name, address, telephone, 
  entity type designation, or query and report point of contact, the entity representative 
  must update the information on the Entity Information Update form and submit 
  it to the HIPDB. Of the 5,000 new registrants, we estimate 250 entities (5 percent 
  of all new registrants) will need to update their organization's information 
  each year. <br>
  <br>
  An eligible entity may elect to have an outside organization query or report 
  to the HIPDB on its behalf. This organization is referred to as an authorized 
  agent. Before an authorized agent acts on behalf of an entity, the eligible 
  entity must complete and submit an <em>Agent Designation</em> form to the HIPDB 
  Help Line. The information collected on this form provides the HIPDB with essential 
  information concerning the agent, such as name, address and telephone number. 
  We estimate that 100 entities (2 percent of all new registrants) will elect 
  an authorized agent to query or report to the HIPDB on their behalf. We estimate 
  that it will take an entity 10 minutes to complete and submit the <em>Agent 
  Designation</em> form to the HIPDB. Any changes to the authorized agent designation, 
  such as routing of responses to queries or termination of an authorized agent, 
  the eligible entity must update the information on the <em>Agent Designation</em> 
  <em>Update</em> form and submit it to the HIPDB. We estimate that five of the 
  100 eligible entities will need to update their agent's information each year. 
</p>

<p><a name="8"></a>8. Section 61.15 describes the process to be followed by a 
  health care provider, supplier or practitioner in disputing the factual accuracy 
  of information in a report and requesting Secretarial review of the disputed 
  report. Based on experience with the NPDB, we estimate that 750 (10 percent 
  of all new reports) will be entered into the &quot;disputed status.&quot; We 
  estimate that it will take a health care provider, supplier or practitioner 
  10 minutes to notify the HIPDB to enter the report into &quot;disputed status.&quot; 
  Of the 750 disputed reports, we estimate that only 37 reports (5 percent) will 
  be forwarded to the Secretary for review. We estimate that it will take a health 
  care provider, supplier or practitioner 8 hours to describe in writing which 
  facts are in dispute and to gather supporting documentation related to the dispute. 
</p>

<p align="center"><b>VI. Waiver of Delayed Effective Date</b></p>

<p>In publishing final regulations, we usually indicate an effective date of 30 days
following their publication in the <u>Federal Register</u>. However, this procedure may be
waived when an agency finds good cause that a delay in the effective date is
impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. <br>
<br>
Section 221(a) of HIPAA stated that the Secretary establish a national health care fraud
and abuse data collection program by January 1, 1997. After a series of meetings with more
than 1,000 current users of the NPDB and potential users of, and reporters to, the HIPDB
(including health plans, State licensing boards, law enforcement officials, Federal and
State Government agencies and professional associations), on October 31, 1998, we
published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <u>Federal Register</u> in which we
requested public comment on the implementation of the HIPDB. As indicated, we received 117
formal public comments in response to that proposed rulemaking. Further, in developing the
final rule, we have also taken into consideration the concerns of numerous Federal
agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department
of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Through this process, the
Department has continued to work closely with the 17 national licensing boards
organizations - including those for nurses, chiropractors, optometrists and physical
therapists - that represent more than 4 million health care practitioners. In addition,
the OIG also has contacted each State Governor regarding the reporting requirements of the
HIPDB and continues to work with the States to help implement the States' reporting. <br>
<br>
To implement the requirements of the statute, we believe that it is urgent that final
regulations be promulgated without further delay in order to (1) streamline the
fact-gathering process by law enforcement officials, regulatory agencies and health plans;
(2) allow health care-related final adverse actions taken against providers, practitioners
and suppliers to be reported to the HIPDB; and (3) establish a centralized system that
will make this information easily accessible to authorized users. <br>
<br>
In light of the fact that we have provided ample opportunity for public input and comment,
and have worked closely with Federal and State Government agencies and various national
organizations and their members in developing the HIPDB, we find that imposing the normal
30-day delay would be contrary to public interest. Therefore, consistent with 5 U.S.C.
553(d), we find good cause to waive the delay in the effective date of this rule and allow
for the timely implementation of final regulations and the start-up of the of data bank. <br>

<p><b>Subpart A - General Provisions</b> <br>
<br>
<b>§61.1 The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank.</b> <br>
<br>
(a) Section 1128E of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (the Secretary) to implement a national health care fraud and abuse
data collection program for the reporting and disclosing of certain final adverse actions
taken against health care providers, suppliers, or practitioners. Section 1128E of the Act
also directs the Secretary to maintain a database of final adverse actions taken against
health care providers, suppliers or practitioners. This data bank will be known as the
Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). Settlements in which no findings or
admissions of liability have been made will be excluded from being reported. However, if
another action is taken against the provider, supplier or practitioner of a health care
item or service as a result of or in conjunction with the settlement, that action is
reportable to the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
(b) Section 1128E of the Act also requires the Secretary to implement the HIPDB in such a
manner as to avoid duplication with the reporting requirements established for the
National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) (See 45 CFR part 60). In accordance with the
statute, the reporter responsible for reporting the final adverse actions to both the
HIPDB and the NPDB will be required to submit only one report, provided that reporting is
made through the Department's consolidated reporting mechanism that will sort the
appropriate actions into the HIPDB, NPDB, or both. <br>
<br>
(c) These regulations set forth the reporting and disclosure requirements for the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
<b>§61.2 Applicability of these regulations.</b> <br>
<br>
The regulations in this part establish reporting requirements applicable to Federal and
State Government agencies and to health plans, as the terms are defined under §61.3 of
this part. <br>
<br>
<b>§61.3 Definitions.</b> <br>
<br>
<u>Act</u><em> </em>means the Social Security Act. <br>
<br>
<u>Affiliated<em> </em>or associated</u> means health care entities with which a subject
of a final adverse action has a commercial relationship, including but not limited to,
organizations, associations, corporations, or partnerships. It also includes a
professional corporation or other business entity composed of a single individual. <br>
<br>
<u>Any other negative action or finding</u> by a Federal or State licensing agency means
any action or finding that under the State's law is (1) publicly available information,
and (2) rendered by a licensing or certification authority, including but not limited to,
limitations on the scope of practice, liquidations, injunctions and forfeitures. This
definition also includes final adverse actions rendered by a Federal or State licensing or
certification authority, such as exclusions, revocations or suspension of license or
certification that occur in conjunction with settlements in which no finding of liability
has been made (although such a settlement itself is not reportable under the statute).
This definition excludes citations, corrective action plans and personnel actions. <br>
<br>
<u>Civil judgment</u> means a court-ordered action rendered in a Federal or State court
proceeding, other than a criminal proceeding. This reporting requirement<b> </b>does
not include Consent Judgments that have been agreed upon and entered to provide security
for civil settlements in which there was no finding or admission of liability. <br>
<br>
<u>Criminal conviction</u> means a conviction as described in section 1128(i) of the Act. <br>
<br>
<u>Exclusion</u> means a temporary or permanent debarment of an individual or entity from
participation in any Federal or State health-related program, in accordance with which
items or services furnished by such person or entity will not be reimbursed under any
Federal or State health-related program. <br>
<br>
<u>Government agency</u> includes, but is not limited to -- </p>

<p>(1) The U.S. Department of Justice; </p>

<p>(2) The U.S Department of Health and Human Services; </p>

<p>(3) Any other Federal agency that either administers or provides payment for the
delivery of health care services, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of
Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; <br>
<br>
(4) Federal and State law enforcement agencies, including States Attorneys General and law
enforcement investigators; <br>
<br>
(5) State Medicaid Fraud Control Units; and <br>
<br>
(6) Federal or State agencies responsible for the licensing and certification of health
care providers, suppliers or licensed health care practitioners. Examples of such State
agencies include Departments of Professional Regulation, Health, Social Services
(including State Survey and Certification and Medicaid Single State agencies), Commerce
and Insurance. <br>
<br>
<u>Health care provider</u> means a provider of services as defined in section 1861(u) of
the Act; any health care entity (including a health maintenance organization, preferred
provider organization or group medical practice) that provides health care services and
follows a formal peer review process for the purpose of furthering quality health care,
and any other health care entity that, directly or through contracts, provides health care
services. <br>
<br>
<u>Health care supplier</u> means a provider of medical and other health care services as
described in section 1861(s) of the Act; or any individual or entity, other than a
provider, who furnishes, whether directly or indirectly, or provides access to, health
care services, supplies, items, or ancillary services (including, but not limited to,
durable medical equipment suppliers, manufacturers of health care items, pharmaceutical
suppliers and manufacturers, health record services such as medical, dental and patient
records, health data suppliers, and billing and transportation service suppliers). The
term also includes any individual or entity under contract to provide such supplies, items
or ancillary services; health plans as<b><em> </em></b>defined in 45 CFR 61.3
(including employers that are self-insured); and health insurance producers (including but
not limited to agents, brokers, solicitors, consultants and reinsurance intermediaries). <br>
<br>
<u>Health plan</u> means a plan, program or organization that provides health benefits,
whether directly, through insurance, reimbursement or otherwise, and includes but is not
limited to -- </p>

<p>(1) A policy of health insurance; </p>

<p>(2) A contract of a service benefit organization; </p>

<p>(3) A membership agreement with a health maintenance organization or other prepaid
health plan; </p>

<p>(4) A plan, program, or agreement established, maintained or made available by an
employer or group of employers, a practitioner, provider or supplier group, third party
administrator, integrated health care delivery system, employee welfare association,
public service group or organization or professional association; and </p>

<p>(5) An insurance company, insurance service or insurance organization that is licensed
to engage in the business of selling health care insurance in a State and which is subject
to State law which regulates health insurance. <br>
<br>
<u>Licensed health care practitioner, licensed practitioner, or practitioner</u> means,
with respect to a State, an individual who is licensed or otherwise authorized by the
State to provide health care services (or any individual who, without authority, holds
himself or herself out to be so licensed or authorized). <br>
<br>
<u>Organization name</u> means the subject's business or employer at the time the
underlying acts occurred. If more than one business or employer is involved, the one most
closely related to the underlying acts should be reported in the &quot;organization
name,&quot; field with the others being reported in the &quot;affiliated or associated
health care entities&quot; field. <br>
<br>
<u>Organization type</u> means a brief description of the nature of that business or
employer. <br>
<br>
<u>Other adjudicated actions or decisions</u> means formal or official final actions (1)
taken against a health care provider, supplier or practitioner by a Federal or State
governmental agency or a health plan; (2) which include the availability of a due process
mechanism, and; (3) are based on acts or omissions that affect or could affect the
payment, provision or delivery of a health care item or service. For example, a formal or
official final action taken by a Federal or State governmental agency or a health plan may
include, but is not limited to, a personnel-related action such as suspensions without
pay, reductions in pay, reductions in grade for cause, terminations or other comparable
actions. A hallmark of any valid adjudicated action or decision is the availability of a
due process mechanism. The fact that the subject elects not to use the due process
mechanism provided by the authority bringing the action is immaterial, as long as such a
process is available to the subject before the adjudicated action or decision is made
final. In general, if an &quot;adjudicated action<em> </em>or decision&quot; follows an
agency's established administrative procedures (which ensure that due process is available
to the subject of the final adverse action), it would qualify as a reportable action under
this definition. The definition specifically excludes clinical privileging actions taken
by Federal or State Government agencies and similar paneling decisions made by health
plans. The definition does not include overpayment determinations made by Federal or State
Government programs, their contractors or health plans; and it does not include denial of
claims determinations made by Government agencies or health plans. For health plans that
are not Government entities, an action taken following adequate notice and the opportunity
for a hearing that meets the standards of due process set out in section 412(b) of the
HCQIA (42 U.S.C. 11112(b)) also would qualify as a reportable action under this
definition. <br>
<br>
<u>Secretary</u> means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any other officer or
employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has
been delegated. <br>
<br>
<u>State</u> means any of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. <br>
<br>
<u>Voluntary surrender</u> means a surrender made after a notification of investigation or
a formal official request by a Federal or State licensing or certification authority for a
health care provider, supplier or practitioner to surrender the license or certification
(including certification agreements or contracts for participation in Federal or State
health care programs). The definition also includes those instances where a health care
provider, supplier or practitioner voluntarily surrenders a license or certification
(including program participation agreements or contracts) in exchange for a decision by
the licensing or certification authority to cease an investigation or similar proceeding,
or in return for not conducting an investigation or proceeding, or in lieu of a
disciplinary action. <br>

<br>
<b>§ 61.11 Reporting other adjudicated actions or decisions.</b> <br>
<br>
(a) <u>Who must report</u><em>. </em>Federal and State governmental agencies and health
plans must report other adjudicated actions or decisions as defined in § 61.3 related to
the delivery, payment or provision of a health care item or service against health care
providers, suppliers, and practitioners (regardless of whether the other adjudicated
action or decision is subject to a pending appeal). <br>
<br>
(b) Entities described in paragraph (a) of this section <u>must report</u> the information
as required in § 61.10(b). <br>
<br>
(c) Entities described in paragraph (a) of this section <u>should report, if known</u> the
information as described in § 61.10(c). <br>
<br>
(d) <u>Sanctions for failure to report.</u> Any health plan that fails to report
information on an other adjudicated action or decision required to be reported under this
section will be subject to a civil money penalty (CMP) of not more than $25,000 for each
such action not reported. Such penalty will be imposed and collected in the same manner as
CMPs under subsection (a) of section 1128A of the Act. The Secretary will provide for
publication of a public report that identifies those Government agencies that have failed
to report information on other adjudicated actions as required to be reported under this
section. <br>
<br>
<b>Subpart C - Disclosure of Information by the Healthcare Integrity and Protection
Data Bank </b><br>
<br>
<b>§ 61.12 Requesting information from the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data
Bank.</b> <br>
<br>
(a) <u>Who may request information and what information may be available</u><em>.</em><b>
</b>Information in the HIPDB will be available, upon request, to the following
persons or entities, or their authorized agents -- </p>

<p>(1) Federal and State Government agencies;</p>

<p>(2) Health plans;</p>

<p>(3) A health care practitioner, provider, or supplier requesting information concerning
himself, herself or itself; and</p>

<p>(4) A person or entity requesting statistical information, which does not permit
identification of any individual or entity. (For example, researchers can use statistical
information to identify the total number of practitioners excluded from the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Similarly, health plans can use statistical information to develop
outcome measures in their efforts to monitor and improve quality care.) <br>
<br>
(b) <u>Procedures for obtaining HIPDB information.</u> Eligible individuals and entities
may obtain information from the HIPDB by submitting a request in such form and manner as
the Secretary may prescribe. These requests are subject to fees set forth in § 61.13 of
this part. The HIPDB will comply with the Department's principles of fair information
practice by providing each subject of a report with a copy when the report is entered into
the HIPDB. <br>
<br>
(c) <u>Information provided in response to self-queries.</u> (1) At the time subjects
request information as part of a &quot;self-query,&quot; the subject will receive -</p>

<p>(i) Any report(s) in the HIPDB specific to them; and</p>

<p>(ii) A disclosure history from the HIPDB of the name(s) of any entity (or entities)
that have<br>
previously received the report(s).</p>

<p>(2) The disclosure history will be restricted in accordance with the Privacy Act
regulations set forth in 45 CFR part 5b. <br>
<br>
<b>§ 61.13 Fees applicable to requests for information.</b> <br>
<br>
(a) <u>Policy on fees</u>. The fees described in this section apply to all requests for
information from the HIPDB, except requests from Federal agencies. However, for purposes
of verification and dispute resolution at the time the report is accepted, the HIPDB will
provide a copy -- at the time a report has been submitted automatically, without a request
and free of charge -- of every report to the health care provider, supplier or
practitioner who is the subject of the report. For the same purpose, the Department will
provide a copy of the report--at the time a report has been submitted automatically,
without a request and free of charge--to the reporter that submitted it. </p>

<p>The fees are authorized by section 1128E(d)(2) of the Act, and they reflect the full
costs of operating the database. The actual fees will be announced by the Secretary in
periodic notices in the <u>Federal Register</u>. <br>
<br>
(b) <u>Criteria for determining the fee</u>. The amount of each fee will be determined
based on the following criteria --</p>

<p>(1) Direct and indirect personnel costs;</p>

<p>(2) Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs including rent and
depreciation on land, buildings and equipment</p>

<p>(3) Agency management and supervisory costs;</p>

<p>(4) Costs of enforcement, research and establishment of regulations and guidance;</p>

<p>(5) Use of electronic data processing equipment to collect and maintain
information--the actual cost of the service, including computer search time, runs and
printouts; and</p>

<p>(6) Any other direct or indirect costs related to the provision of services. <br>
<br>
(c) <u>Assessing and collecting fees.</u> The Secretary will announce through periodic
notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> the method of payment of fees. In determining these
methods, the Secretary will consider efficiency, effectiveness and convenience for users
and for the Department. </p>

<p>Methods may include credit card, electronic funds transfer and other methods of
electronic payment. <br>
<br>
<b>§ 61.14 Confidentiality of Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank
information.</b> <br>
<br>
Information reported to the HIPDB is considered confidential and will not be disclosed
outside the Department, except as specified in §§ 61.12 and 61.15 of this part. Persons
and entities receiving information from the HIPDB, either directly or from another party,
must use it solely with respect to the purpose for which it was provided. Nothing in this
paragraph will prevent the disclosure of information by a party from its own files used to
create such reports where disclosure is otherwise authorized under applicable State or
Federal law. <br>
<br>
<b>§ 61.15 How to dispute the accuracy of Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data
Bank information.</b> <br>
<br>
(a) <u>Who may dispute the HIPDB information.</u> The HIPDB will routinely mail or
transmit electronically to the subject a copy of the report filed in the HIPDB. The
subject of the report or a designated representative may dispute the accuracy of a report
concerning himself, herself or itself within 60 calendar days of receipt of the report. <br>
<br>
(b) <u>Procedures for disputing a report with the reporting entity.</u> (1) If the subject
disagrees with the reported information, the subject must request in writing that the
HIPDB enter the report into &quot;disputed status.&quot; </p>

<p>(2) The HIPDB will send the report, with a notation that the report has been placed in
&quot;disputed status,&quot; to queriers (where identifiable), the reporting entity and
the subject of the report. </p>

<p>(3) The subject must attempt to enter into discussion with the reporting entity to
resolve the dispute. If the reporting entity revises the information originally submitted
to the HIPDB, the HIPDB will notify the subject and all entities to whom reports have been
sent that the original information has been revised. If the reporting entity does not
revise the reported information, or does not respond to the subject within 60 days, the
subject may request that the Secretary review the report for accuracy. The Secretary will
decide whether to correct the report within 30 days of the request. This time frame may be
extended for good cause. The subject also may provide a statement to the HIPDB, either
directly or through a designated representative, that will permanently append the report. <br>
<br>
(c) <u>Procedures for requesting a Secretarial review</u>. (1) The subject must request,
in writing, that the Secretary of the Department review the report for accuracy. The
subject must return this request to the HIPDB along with appropriate materials that
support the subject's position. The Secretary will only review the accuracy of the
reported information, and will not consider the merits or appropriateness of the action or
the due process that the subject received. </p>

<p>(2) After the review, if the Secretary --</p>

<p>(i) Concludes that the information is accurate and reportable to the HIPDB, the
Secretary will inform the subject and the HIPDB of the determination. The Secretary will
include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in the report that describes the basis
for the decision. The report will be removed from &quot;disputed status.&quot; The HIPDB
will distribute the corrected report and statement(s) to previous queriers (where
identifiable), the reporting entity and the subject of the report.</p>

<p>(ii) Concludes that the information contained in the report is inaccurate, the
Secretary will inform the subject of the determination and direct the HIPDB or the
reporting entity to revise the report. The Secretary will include a brief statement
(Secretarial Statement) in the report describing the findings. The HIPDB will distribute
the corrected report and statement (s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the
reporting entity and the subject of the report.</p>

<p>(iii) Determines that the disputed issues are outside the scope of the Department's
review, the Secretary will inform the subject and the HIPDB of the determination. The
Secretary will include a brief statement (Secretarial Statement) in the report describing
the findings. The report will be removed from &quot;disputed status.&quot; The HIPDB will
distribute the report and the statement(s) to previous queriers (where identifiable), the
reporting entity and the subject of the report.</p>

<p>(iv) Determines that the adverse action was not reportable and therefore should be
removed from the HIPDB, the Secretary will inform the subject and direct the HIPDB to void
the report. </p>

<p>The HIPDB will distribute a notice to previous queriers (where identifiable), 
  the reporting entity and the subject of the report that the report has been 
  voided. <br>
  <br>
  <b>§ 61.16 Immunity.</b> <br>
  <br>
  Individuals, entities or their authorized agents and the HIPDB shall not be 
  held liable in any civil action filed by the subject of a report unless the 
  individual, entity or authorized agent submitting the report has actual knowledge 
  of the falsity of the information contained in the report.</p>
