<p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b> 

<p><b>I.  Background</b>

<p>   Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)) provides
criminal penalties for individuals or entities that knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or
receive remuneration in order to induce the referral of business reimbursable under the Federal
or State health care programs.  The offense is classified as a felony and is punishable by fines of
up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to five years.  Violations of the anti-kickback statute may
also result in the imposition of a civil money penalty (CMP) under section 1128A(a)(7) of the
Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(7)) or program exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act (42
U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7)).

<p>   The types of remuneration covered specifically include kickbacks, bribes and rebates, whether
made directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind.  In addition, prohibited
conduct includes not only the payment of remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients,
but also the payment of remuneration intended to induce the purchasing, leasing or ordering of
any good, facility, service or item reimbursable by any Federal or State health care program.

<p><u>Establishing the original safe harbors</u>

<p>   Since the statute on its face is so broad, concern had been expressed that some relatively
innocuous commercial arrangements were technically covered by the statute and therefore were
subject to criminal prosecution.  As a response to the above concern, section 14 of the Medicare
and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, Public Law 100-93, specifically
required the development and promulgation of regulations, the so-called "safe harbor"
provisions, designed to specify various payment and business practices which, although
potentially capable of inducing referrals of business under the Federal and State health care
programs, would not be treated as criminal offenses under the anti-kickback statute.  Beginning
in July 29, 1991, we have published in the <u>Federal Register</u> a series of final regulations
establishing "safe harbors" in various areas.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  These OIG safe harbor provisions have been
developed to limit the reach of the statute somewhat by permitting certain non-abusive
arrangements, while encouraging beneficial and innocuous arrangements.

<p>   Health care providers and others may voluntarily seek to comply with these provisions so that
they have the assurance that their business practices are not subject to any enforcement action
under the anti-kickback statute, the CMP provision for anti-kickback violations or program
exclusion authority related to kickbacks.  In giving the Department the authority to protect
certain arrangements and payment practices under the anti-kickback statute, Congress intended
the safe harbor regulations to be evolving rules that would be updated periodically to reflect
changing business practices and technologies in the health care industry. 

<p><u>OIG Advisory Opinions on restocking ambulance supplies</u>

<p>    The OIG has issued four advisory opinions regarding arrangements between hospitals and
other facilities providing emergency medical supplies, i.e., "receiving facilities" and ambulance
companies, under which the receiving facilities replenish ambulances with drugs and medical
supplies used during the transport of <u>emergency</u> patients to the receiving facilities.  In many of
these arrangements, the drugs and supplies are replenished without charge to the ambulance
company.
<p>   In OIG Advisory Opinion 97-6 (October 8, 1997), we responded to a request for an advisory
opinion involving an ambulance replenishing arrangement that presented a specific set of facts
clearly implicating the anti-kickback statute.  The arrangement, as presented in the facts certified
by the requesting party, contained no appropriate safeguards against fraud and abuse of the
Federal health care programs and their beneficiaries.  Accordingly, we concluded that the
arrangement potentially violated the anti-kickback statute.

<p>   Subsequently, in 1998, we received several additional advisory opinion requests that involved
ambulance replenishing arrangements, and issued three additional advisory opinions <u>approving</u>
ambulance replenishing arrangements.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  The facts of those three arrangements differed
significantly from the facts that led to OIG Advisory Opinion 97-6.  Specifically, the latter three
opinions involved ambulance replenishing programs conducted in accordance with
comprehensive, coordinated emergency medical delivery systems involving all of an area's
ambulance providers and hospitals (as well as other components of the emergency medical
system, such as physicians and local government officials).  The OIG approved the three
arrangements (with the limited exception of a portion of one of the three programs), persuaded
that the arrangements posed little risk of Federal health care program fraud or abuse and that the
arrangements promoted comprehensive and coordinated efforts to improve emergency medical
care. 

<p>   Since the release of OIG Advisory Opinion 98-14 in October 1998, the OIG has received no
further advisory opinion requests on the topic of ambulance replenishing and few informal
follow-up inquiries regarding these arrangements.  

<p><b>II.  Provisions of the Proposed Rule</b>

<p>   The OIG believes that, in general, the ambulance and hospital industries understand the
distinction between the first unfavorable advisory opinion and the subsequent three favorable
opinions and are generally able to assess and structure arrangements accordingly.  However, the
OIG is aware of anecdotal reports that some receiving facilities are curbing or eliminating
ambulance replenishing programs in order to cut emergency room costs, while other receiving
facilities feel pressured to participate in ambulance replenishment arrangements.  Some
receiving facilities would like to implement or continue operating replenishing programs, but are
concerned about possible liability under the anti-kickback statute.

<p>   We continue to believe that properly structured replenishing arrangements serve a significant
public interest by providing a means of ensuring that ambulances are fully stocked with current
medications, sanitary linens and appropriate supplies, and that those supplies are compatible
with equipment used in local emergency rooms so as to expedite the transfer of critically ill or
injured patients to emergency room systems.  Such replenishing arrangements are consistent
with Federal policy established over the past 25 years.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
<p>   In an effort to further assure those providers engaged in innocuous and beneficial replenishing
arrangements, we are proposing a new safe harbor under &#167; 1001.952 of our regulations to protect
certain arrangements between receiving facilities (including hospitals) and ambulance companies
under which the receiving facilities replenish ambulances with drugs and medical supplies used
during the transport of <u>emergency</u> patients to the receiving facilities.  Under this proposed rule,
we would provide safe harbor protection for ambulance replenishing arrangements that satisfy
all of the conditions in one of two categories established by the safe harbor.  Both categories
pertain only to <u>emergency</u> ambulance services; the safe harbor would not protect replenishing of
ambulance supplies, linens or medications following routine ambulance transports.  

<p><u>Replenishing arrangements where ambulance provider pays receiving facility fair market value</u> 

<p>   The first new proposed safe harbor would protect replenishing arrangements where an
ambulance provider pays the receiving facility fair market value, based on an arms-length
transaction, for replenished drugs or supplies (including linens) used in connection with the
transport of an emergency patient.  Payment would not need to be made at the time of the
replenishing, provided commercially reasonable and appropriate payment arrangements have
been made in advance.  For linens, an exchange of a comparable quantity of laundered linens for
soiled linens would be considered fair market value, notwithstanding any economic value
attributable to the laundering of linens by receiving facilities, which often have specialized
laundering equipment needed for compliance with sanitation requirements.  A non-profit
receiving facility would be protected under this safe harbor if it sells replenished drugs or
medical supplies to a non-profit ambulance provider at cost in order to comply with the
Non-Profit Institutions Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 

<p><u>Remuneration in the form of contemporaneous replenishing of drugs or medical supplies</u>

<p>   The second proposed safe harbor would protect remuneration in the form of contemporaneous
replenishing of drugs or medical supplies (including linens) used during an emergency transport
of a patient to the receiving facility, even if the replenishing is for free or at reduced prices.  We
are proposing that the following seven conditions be met in order to qualify for protection under
this safe harbor :

<p>   (1) Receiving facilities must provide replenishing on an equal basis for all ambulance
providers who bring emergency patients to the receiving facility.  This condition is intended to
prevent receiving facilities from inappropriately using replenishing to attract or reward high
referring ambulance providers.

<p>   (2) The replenishing arrangement must be part of a comprehensive and coordinated effort to
improve the EMS delivery system in the relevant service area and must be open to all emergency
ambulance providers and receiving facilities operating in the service area.  It must be
implemented with the participation of, and monitored by, a regional EMS Council or
functionally similar entity, organization or association (the Oversight Entity).  The Oversight
Entity must be a non-profit entity composed of representatives of a broad array of participants in
a service area's emergency medical system, such as hospitals, ambulance providers, emergency
room physicians and nurses, public safety organizations, paramedics, local educational
institutions and community residents.  The involvement of a wide range of representatives of the
local EMS community provides substantial assurance that the replenishment arrangement is
intended to benefit the local community, rather than a single provider or group of providers. 
Participation in the Oversight Entity should be open to all interested parties in the service area on
equal terms and conditions, i.e., the Oversight Entity cannot be composed solely of
representatives of a single health system.  Typically, Oversight Entities will engage in the
following types of activities:

<p>	-	standardization of EMS practices and equipment; 

<p>	-	education and training for pre-hospital care providers; 

<p>	-	ongoing evaluation and improvement of EMS capabilities in the service area;

<p>	-	 public information campaigns; and 

<p>	-	other activities designed to promote EMS care for the service area.

<p>   We recognize that the size, composition, structure and scope of activities of Oversight Entities
may necessarily vary depending on the size and resources of the particular service area.  We
would expect, for example, an Oversight Entity in a small rural area with one hospital, a few
physicians and one ambulance provider to look and operate differently than one in a densely
populated urban area with several hospitals, a number of transport providers and diverse
physicians, teaching facilities, Government agencies and the like.  Oversight Entities should be
part of a comprehensive and coordinated regional EMS system appropriate to the size and
resources of the service area.  We are not specifying any particular structure or legal form for the
Oversight Entity; it must simply be functionally similar to a regional EMS Counsel.  The
participants in the Oversight Entity should be representative of the service area's EMS system. 
We are specifically soliciting comments on our proposal that safe harbored replenishing
arrangements must be a part of a comprehensive and consolidated regional EMS system.

<p>   (3) The replenishing arrangement must be memorialized in writing, whether through a contract
signed under the auspices of the Oversight Entity by all participating ambulance providers and
receiving facilities or by a generally applicable plan or protocol promulgated or approved by the
Oversight Entity.  The replenishing arrangement must in practice comport with the terms of the
written documentation.

<p>   (4) The receiving facility must not bill any Federal health care program or Federal program
beneficiary for the replenished drugs or supplies, or write off such drugs or supplies as bad debt. 
The purpose of this requirement is to prevent double payments by Medicare, which pays
hospitals under Part A (through fiscal intermediaries), but which typically pays ambulance
providers for drugs and supplies used during emergency transports under Part B (through
carriers).

<p>   (5) In order to prevent "double dipping," ambulance providers may not bill any Federal health
care program or Federal beneficiary <u>separately</u> for the replenished drugs or supplies.

<p>   (6) The receiving facility and the ambulance provider must maintain records of the replenished
drugs or supplies and make those records available to the Secretary upon request.

<p>   (7) The receiving facility and ambulance provider must otherwise comply with all Federal,
State and local laws regulating emergency medical care and the provision of drugs and medical
supplies, including laws relating to the handling of controlled substances such as morphine.

<p>   Nothing in this preamble or the proposed regulations is intended to express any view as to the
appropriate billing of the Federal health care programs for supplies used during emergency
transport services.  Parties seeking to comply with these proposed safe harbors would still need
to comply with all relevant billing and claims filing rules.  The fifth and sixth conditions
described above for the second proposed safe harbor merely set forth criteria for determining
whether a particular arrangement qualifies for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback
statute; the conditions do not purport to establish any reimbursement rule.  Questions regarding
reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs should be addressed to the Health
Care Financing Administration or the party's relevant fiscal intermediary or carrier.

<p>   As with the existing safe harbor provisions currently codified in &#167; 1001.952, compliance with
these proposed safe harbors would be voluntary.  Failure to fit into one of these safe harbors
would not mean that an ambulance replenishment arrangement is <u>illegal</u>.  Rather, it would
simply mean that the arrangement would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

<p><u>Meeting the criteria for establishing new safe harbors</u>

<p>  Section 205 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Public Law 104-191,
established certain criteria that the Secretary may consider when modifying or establishing safe
harbors to the anti-kickback statute.  We indicated our intent to consider these criteria in
evaluating proposals for new safe harbors in our Notice of Intent to Develop Regulations
(61 FR 69061; December 31, 1996).  We have considered these criteria in developing this
proposed rulemaking, and we believe, for the reasons described above, that the proposed safe
harbor for certain ambulance replenishing arrangements is likely to:  (l) increase or have no
effect on access for needy patients to health care services; (2) increase the quality of health care
services for needy patients; (3) have little or no effect on the cost of Federal health care
programs; (4) have little or no effect on competition; and (5) have little or no effect on the
quantity of services provided in underserved areas.   We further believe the proposed safe harbor
contains safeguards that limit the potential for overutilization and assure that patients retain their
freedom of choice of service providers. 

<p><b>III.  Regulatory Impact Statement</b>

<p><u>Executive Order 12866, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Executive Order 13132,  and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act</u>

<p>   The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance
with the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and has determined that it does not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action. 
Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when rulemaking is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize
net benefits, including potential economic, environmental, public health, safety distributive and
equity effects.  Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Public Law 104-4, requires
that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits on any rulemaking that may
result in an expenditure by State, local or tribal Government, or by the private sector of $100
million or more in any given year.  Further, Executive Order 13132, Federalism, requires
agencies to determine if a rule will have a significant affect on States, on their relationship with
the Federal Government, and on the distribution of power and responsibility among the various
levels of government. 

<p>    In addition, under the Small Business Enforcement Act (SBEA) of 1996, if a rule has a
significant economic effect on a substantial number of small businesses, the Secretary must
specifically consider the economic effect of a rule on small business entities and analyze
regulatory options that could lessen the impact of the rule.  In addition, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
businesses, the Secretary must specifically consider the economic effect of a rule on small
business entities and analyze regulatory options that could lessen the impact of the rule.  

<p>   Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, costs,
benefits, incentives, equity and available information.  Regulations must meet certain standards,
such as avoiding unnecessary burden. We believe that this proposed rule would have no
significant economic impact.  The proposed safe harbor provisions set forth in this rulemaking
are designed to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business practices and
arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and economy.  As indicated above, in
doing so, these regulations impose no requirements on any party.  Health care providers and
others may voluntarily seek to comply with these provisions so that they have the assurance that
their business practices are not subject to any enforcement actions under the anti-kickback
statute.  We believe that any aggregate economic effect of these safe harbor regulations would be
minimal and would impact only those limited few who engage in prohibited behavior in
violation of the statute.  As such, we believe that the aggregate economic impact of these
proposed regulations is minimal and would have no effect on the economy or on Federal or State
expenditures.

<p>   Additionally, in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, we believe that
there are no significant costs associated with these proposed safe harbor guidelines that would
impose any mandates on State, local or tribal governments, or the private sector that will result
in an expenditure of $100 million or more in any given year.  Further, in reviewing this rule
under the threshold criteria of Executive Order 13132, Federalism, we have determined that this
rule would not significantly affect the rights, roles and responsibilities of States, and that a full
analysis under these Acts are not necessary.<br>
<br>
Further, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, and the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996, which amended the RFA, we are required to
determine if this rule will have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities and, if so, to identify regulatory options that could lessen the impact.  While these safe
harbor provisions may have an impact on small entities, we believe that the aggregate economic
impact of this rulemaking would be minimal, since it is the nature of the violation and not the
size of the entity that will result in a violation of the anti-kickback statute.  Since the vast
majority of individuals and entities potentially affected by these regulations do not engage in
prohibited arrangements, schemes or practices in violation of the law, we believe that these
proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a number of small
business entities, and that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this rulemaking.     

<p><u>Paperwork Reduction Act</u>

<p>   In accordance with section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, we
are required to solicit public comments, and receive final OMB approval, on any information
collection requirements set forth in rulemaking.  While compliance with the provisions in this
safe harbor rule would be voluntary, proposed &#167; 1001.952(v)(3) contains information collection
requirements that would require approval by OMB.  As such, we are required to solicit public
comments under section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA on these requirements.  Specifically, in order
to qualify for safe harbor protection for ambulance restocking arrangements under 

<p>&#167; 1001.952(v)(3), the regulations would require that replenishing agreements be set forth in
writing in the form of (1) a contract signed under the auspices of the oversight entity by all
participating ambulance providers and receiving facilities or (2) a generally applicable plan or
protocol promulgated or approved by the oversight entity.  There is no obligation to submit these
agreements to the Secretary, however, in order to achieve initial compliance with the safe harbor. 
In addition, to qualify for safe harbor protection for ambulance restocking arrangements under 

<p>&#167; 1001.952(v)(3), the receiving facility and the ambulance provider must maintain records of the
replenished drugs and medical supplies (including linens) and make those records available to
the Secretary promptly upon request.  However, as indicated above, the safe harbor <u>does not</u>
require any submission of reports, data collection or other documents in order to be in
compliance with the anti-kickback statute.

<p>   In accordance with the PRA requirements, we are inviting comments on (1) whether the
proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of
the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the
estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the
quality, utility and clarity of the information collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of
the collection of information on parties, including through the use of automated collection
techniques or other forms of information technology.  As part of the OMB approval for the
collection of information contained in this rule, we are soliciting public comments on this
requirement, thereby initiating the normal PRA clearance.

<p>   <u>Title</u>:  Ambulance Restocking Safe Harbor Under the Anti-Kickback Statute. 

<p>   <u>Summary of the collection of information</u>:  Proposed &#167; 1001.952(v) would set forth a new
statutory exception to the anti-kickback statute that covers any gift or transfer of drugs or
medical supplies (including linens) by a hospital or other receiving facility to an ambulance
provider for the purpose of replenishing comparable drugs or medical supplies (including linens)
used by the ambulance provider in connection with the transport of an emergency patient to the
hospital or other receiving facility.  Safe harbors do not create any affirmative obligation on any
individuals or entities.  Seeking protection under these safe harbor provisions is purely
voluntary.

<p>   The aggregate information burden for the information collection requirements contained in this
proposed rulemaking is set forth below.

<p>   <u>Respondents</u>: In accordance with proposed &#167; 1001.952(v), the respondents for the collection of
information described in these regulations are parties involved in written agreements between (1)
a hospital or other receiving facility that replenishes drugs and medical supplies, and (2)
ambulance providers who bring emergency patients to the receiving facility.

<p>   <u>Estimated number of respondents</u>: The safe harbor being proposed in &#167; 1001.952(v) would
protect those restocking arrangements between receiving facilities that replenish drugs and
medical supplies on an equal basis to all ambulance providers who transport their emergency
patients to the receiving facility.  Virtually all such replenishing arrangements already are
memorialized in written contracts as a matter of prudent business practice, irrespective of the
existence of the proposed safe harbor.  We believe that few, if any, parties will enter into written
arrangements specifically for the purposes of safe harbor protection.  Accordingly, we estimate
that the number of parties entering into written agreements to qualify for safe harbor protection
will be negligible. 

<p>   <u>Estimated number of responses per respondent</u>: None.

<p>   <u>Estimated total annual burden on respondents</u>: We believe that the burden of preparing written
agreements and the aggregate information burden for the information collection requirements
contained in this proposed rulemaking would be minimal.  As indicated above, in most, if not all,
cases the parties already have written agreements as part of the parties' replenishing
arrangements, independent of the safe harbor requirements.  Accordingly, any burden imposed
by these proposed regulations would impose no burden on such parties.

<p>   Comments on this information collection activity should be sent to:

<p>   Allison Herron Eydt, OIG Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235,
New Executive Office Building, 725 17<sup>th</sup> Street. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20053, 

<p>FAX:  (202) 395-6974.

<p>   Comments on these paperwork reduction requirements may be submitted to the above-cited
individual within 60 days following the <u>Federal Register</u> publication of this proposed rule. 

<p><b>IV.  Public Inspection of Comments and Response to Comments</b>

<p>   Comments will be available for public inspection [2 weeks after publication date in the <u>Federal

<p>   Accordingly, 42 CFR part 1001 would be amended as set forth below:
<p><b>PART 1001 - [AMENDED]</b>

<p>1. The authority citation for part 1001 would continue to read as follows: 
<p><b>   Authority:</b> 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1320a-7, 1320a-7b, 1395u(h), 1395u(j), 1395u(k), 1395y(d),

3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note).

<p>2.  Section 1001.952 would be amended by republishing the introductory paragraph for this
section and by adding a new paragraph (v) to read as follows:

<p><b>&#167; 1001.952  Exceptions</b>

<p>   The following payment practices shall not be treated as a criminal offense under section 1128B
of the Act and shall not serve as the basis for an exclusion:

<p><b>*     *     *     *     *</b>

<p>   (v) <u>Ambulance restocking</u>.  (1) As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not
include any gift or transfer of drugs or medical supplies (including linens) by a hospital or other
receiving facility to an ambulance provider for the purpose of replenishing comparable drugs or
medical supplies (including linens) used by the ambulance provider in connection with the
transport of an emergency patient to the hospital or other receiving facility if all of the applicable
standards in either paragraph (v )(2) or (v )(3) are satisfied.

<p>   (2)(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (v)(2)(ii) of this section, the ambulance
provider pays the receiving facility fair market value, based on an arms-length transaction, for
the replenished drugs or medical supplies (including linens).  A non-profit receiving facility will
be deemed to meet this standard if it sells replenished drugs or medical supplies to a non-profit
ambulance provider at cost in order to comply with the Non-Profit Institutions Act (15 U.S.C.
13(c)), exception to the Robinson-Patman Act (15 U.S.C. 3(a)-(f)).

<p>   (ii) If payment is not made contemporaneously with the replenishing of the drugs or medical
supplies (including linens), the receiving facility and the ambulance provider make
commercially reasonable payment arrangements in advance. 

<p>   (3)(i) The receiving facility replenishes drugs and medical supplies (including linens) on an
equal basis for all ambulance providers who bring emergency patients to the receiving facility.

<p>   (ii) The replenishing arrangement must be implemented with the participation of, and
monitored by, an oversight entity (as defined in this subparagraph) as part of a comprehensive
and coordinated regional emergency medical system appropriate to the size and resources of the
service area and must be open and available to all emergency ambulance providers and receiving
facilities in the service area. 

<p>   (iii) The replenishing arrangement must be memorialized in writing.  The writing may be in the
form of - 

<p>   (A) A contract signed under the auspices of the oversight entity by all participating ambulance
providers and receiving facilities or 

<p>   (B) A generally applicable plan or protocol promulgated or approved by the oversight entity.

<p>   (iv) The receiving facility refrains from billing any Federal health care program or Federal
health care program beneficiary for the replenished drugs or medical supplies (including linens)
and does not write off the cost of such drugs or medical supplies (including linens) as bad debt.

<p>   (v) The ambulance provider refrains from billing any Federal health care program or Federal
health care program beneficiary <u>separately</u> for the replenished drugs or medical supplies
(including linens).
<p>   (vi) The receiving facility and the ambulance provider maintain records of the replenished
drugs and medical supplies (including linens) and make those records available to the Secretary
promptly upon request.
