<p>OIG has the authority to waive an individual or entity's exclusion as a provider from Federal health programs.  See Section 1128(c)(3)(B)  of the Social Security Act (Act) and 42 C.F.R. 1001.1801(b).

Waivers cannot be granted to those excluded for patient neglect or abuse. <a href="/exclusions/authorities.asp">See section 1128(a)(2)</a> of the Act.</p>
<p>A waiver may be requested only by <strong>the administrator of a Federal or State health program</strong>.   Excluded individuals or entities may not request a waiver from the OIG. For more information on waivers, <a href="/faqs/exclusions-faq.asp">see our FAQs</a>.</p>
