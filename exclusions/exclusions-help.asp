<h2 id="generalSearch">General search and verification strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are checking many names, consider downloading the Downloadable Database into your computer's spreadsheet or database program. This will enable you to use that program's search functions to crosscheck your names against the thousands of names on the LEIE. </li>
<li>If you are checking only a few names, choose the Online Searchable Database. You can search up to five names at once. </li>
<li>When you check the LEIE, using the Online Searchable Database or the Downloadable Database, you should maintain documentation of the initial name search performed and any additional searches conducted in order to verify results of potential name matches.</li>
<li>Do not forget to take the final step of identity verification using the Social Security Number (SSN) for an individual or Employer Identification Number (EIN) for an entity. It is not sufficient to simply find a matching first and last name on the LEIE. </li>
<li>Watch our instructional videos on <a href="./online.asp">Using the Exclusions Online Database</a> and <a href="./download.asp">Using the Exclusions Downloadable Database</a> for more information on how to use the LEIE.</li>

<h2 id="singleSearch">Searching for and verifying an individual</h2>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to double-check that you have the correct spelling of the name before starting your search.</li>
<li>The simpler you can make your search, the better. When searching for the name of an individual, enter only the first few letters of the last name.</li>
<li>You do not need to capitalize letters in the name of an individual. </li>
<li>If a name contains punctuation, you must include the punctuation in your search text. For example, if you are searching for the name "O'Connor," you must include the apostrophe.</li>
<li>An individual with a hyphenated name should be checked under each of the last names in the hyphenated name (e.g., Jane Smith-Jones should be checked under Jane Smith and Jane Jones, in addition to Jane Smith-Jones).</li>
<li>At any time while entering text into the search form, you may click the "Clear" button to erase all text you have entered into the form and start over.</li>
<li>If the database does not contain a Social Security Number (SSN) for an individual, then the number is not available from OIG.</li>
<li>Because the database includes only the name known to OIG at the time the individual was excluded, any former names used by the individual (e.g., maiden name, previous married name, etc.) should be searched in addition to the individual's current name.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click in either the Last Name or First Name boxes, or both, and type part of the individual's name.</li>
<li>Click the Search button.</li>
<li>Click on the column headers to sort the results by a particular column. </li>
<li>In the search results list, click on an excluded individual's last name.</li>
<li>Review the data displayed in the verification form.</li>
<li>Click in the text box underneath the data table and enter the Social Security Number (SSN) provided to you by the individual.</li>
<li>Click on the Verify button.</li>
<li>The result of your verification attempt will be displayed in a message below the form.</li>
</ul>


<div class="contentSeparator"></div>

<h2 id="entitySearch">Search for and verifying an entity</h2>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to double-check that you have the correct spelling of the name before starting your search. </li>
<li>You do not need to capitalize first letters in the names of entities.</li>
<li>If the entity name contains punctuation, you must include the punctuation in your search text. For example, if you are searching for the entity "O'Connor Dentistry," you must include the apostrophe.</li>
<li>The simpler you can make your search, the better. When searching for the name of an entity, enter only the first few letters.</li>
<li>Your search text must begin with the first letters of the entity's name. For example, beginning your search with the word "dental" might return a entity named "DENTAL CARE UNLIMITED" but would not return a entity named "UNITED DENTAL CARE".</li>
<li>At any time while entering text into the search form, you may click the "Clear" button to erase all text you have entered into the form and start over.</li>
