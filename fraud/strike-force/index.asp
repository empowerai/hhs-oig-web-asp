<p>Medicare Fraud Strike Force Teams harness data analytics and the combined resources of Federal, State, and local law enforcement entities to prevent and combat health care fraud, waste, and abuse. First established in March 2007, Strike Force teams currently operate in nine areas: Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Detroit, Michigan; southern Texas; Brooklyn, New York; southern Louisiana; Tampa, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and Dallas, Texas. </p>

<p class="download"><a class="fancybox" title="Los Angeles, California; Houston and Dallas, Texas; Southern Louisiana, Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; Tampa and Miami, Florida" href="./images/labels-strike-force-map.jpg">Map of Strike Force Locations</a></p>


<p>Strike Force teams bring together the efforts of the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, Offices of the United States Attorneys, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, local law enforcement, and others. </p>
<p>These teams have a proven record of success 
in analyzing data and investigative intelligence to quickly identify fraud and bring prosecutions. The interagency collaboration also <img class="r" src="./images/strike-force.jpg" alt="OIG Agents" />enhances the effectiveness of the Strike Force model. For example, OIG refers credible allegations of fraud to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) so that it can suspend payments to the suspected perpetrators, thereby immediately preventing losses from claims submitted by Strike Force targets.</p>

<p>Strike Force teams have shut down health care fraud schemes around the country, arrested more than a thousand criminals, and recovered millions of taxpayer dollars.</p>
