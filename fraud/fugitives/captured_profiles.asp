Robert Allen Lopez</h2>

<ul>
<li>After 20 years on the run, Robert Allen Lopez, who pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud on December 14, 1995, was arrested April 2016, at Miami International Airport. He is in custody and will face additional federal charges. Lopez fled the country after pleading guilty but before his sentencing hearing.</li>
<li>According to the indictment, from July 1991 until June 1994, Lopez and others conspired to defraud Medicare by filing false claims and structuring cash transactions to evade federal currency-reporting requirements.  The fake claims totaled more than $4 million.</li>
<li>OIG investigators found that Lopez established numerous companies in Miami, using sham owners to conceal that he was the true owner. These companies filed false Medicare claims on behalf of beneficiaries for services that were either medically unnecessary or were not provided. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, Lopez also recruited friends and relatives to assist him as sham owners. He directed them to open bank accounts where the fraudulently obtained Medicare reimbursements were deposited. To avoid reporting requirements for cash transactions exceeding $10,000, it is believed that Lopez directed the sham owners to make structured cash withdrawals from the accounts.</li>
<li>When Lopez violated his bail agreement and left the country, he fled with his two children without his wife's consent.  His 10-year-old son was found four years later wandering the streets of Cancun, Mexico.  The child was taken into protective custody and reunited with his mother in the United States.</li>
<li>Lopez was captured after OIG agents, together with the State Department Diplomatic Security Service (DDSS), got a tip that he was living under a false name in Nicaragua.</li>
<li>Agents from DDSS and the U.S. Marshals Service worked with the Nicaraguan government to apprehend Lopez and arrange his return to the United States</li>

<li>On January 16, 2015, Acosta pleaded guilty to charges related to health care fraud and filing false income tax returns.

<li>Following an undercover investigation and execution of a search warrant, Acosta was given until Monday April 3, 2006, to decide whether he would plead guilty.  However, flight records show that on the Sunday before, on April 2, 2006, Acosta and his son left for the Dominican Republic.  Acosta's practice was abruptly closed.

Pullam was indicted in September 2011 and was a fugitive until his capture. </li>
<li>According to court documents, Pullam was a runner for the clinic Lake Medical Group.  Lake Medical functioned as a prescription mill that generated prescriptions for oxycontin that the clinic's purported patients did not need and submitted claims to Medicare and Medi-Cal for services that were medically unnecessary or were ordered by a doctor and not performed.  Pullam often drove recruited Medicare beneficiaries to pharmacies in the greater Los Angeles area to obtain fraudulently prescribed oxycontin.  These patients were previously recruited by Pullam's co-conspirators to receive unnecessary medical care, if any care at all, in exchange for cash kickbacks.</li>
<li>The recruited beneficiaries were routinely issued prescriptions for 90 pills of oxycontin.  After the fraudulent prescriptions were issued, Pullam and others took the filled prescription medication and delivered it to co-conspirators, who then sold it on the streets for approximately $17 to $23 per pill.  In addition, Medicare Part D and Medicare PDPs paid approximately $2.7 million for oxycontin prescribed by the clinic and its doctors. </li>
<li>Pullam was a fugitive until his capture and arrest in Los Angeles on May 3, 2012.</li>

<li>In March 2011, Yusuf was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Investigators believe that Yusuf and her co-conspirators billed Medicare for more than $3.4 million for durable medical equipment (DME) that was neither medically necessary nor prescribed by a physician. </li>
<li>Yusuf owned and operated Ivy Health Care Supply, a DME company based in Stafford, Texas. According to court records, Yusuf and her co-conspirators allegedly improperly acquired Medicare patient information to submit false claims to Medicare. The defendants then forged physicians' signatures on prescriptions and certificates of medical necessity (CMN). They also altered prescriptions and CMNs after they had been signed by physicians. The defendants then billed Medicare for power wheelchairs, orthotic equipment, and other medical supplies that were not prescribed or otherwise authorized by a physician, were not medically necessary, and were not requested by the beneficiaries. </li>
<li>Investigators believe that Yusuf and her co-conspirators falsely billed Medicare for claims for nearly 800 Medicare patients, primarily located in Texas and Louisiana. Based on these claims, Ivy Health Care Supply was reimbursed approximately $1.6 million from Medicare. Yusuf and her co-conspirators allegedly diverted these funds from her business for their own personal use and benefit, as well as that of others. </li>

Investigators believe that Gonzalez and Harris billed Medicare for over $26 million for medical services that were not provided or were not necessary.</li>
<li>Also involved in the conspiracy but charged separately were OIG Most Wanted Fugitives <a href="/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp#benitez">Carlos, Luis, and Jose Benitez</a>.

<h2><span class="captured-heading">CAPTURED:</span>  
Luis Perez Moreira</h2>

<ul>
<li>Luis Perez Moreira was sentenced on September 15, 2011, to 63 months' incarceration. In September 2010, his co-conspirator Emilio Tain pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and was sentenced to 10 months' incarceration.</li>
<li>Moreira is a subject in two separate criminal investigations involving E & E Medical Services Corporation (d/b/a Elbia's Pharmacy) and Rx Plus Medical Care (Rx Plus), both based in Miami.</li>
<li>In April 2010, Moreira and co-conspirator Emilio Tain were indicted on charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. As operators of Elbia's Pharmacy, Moreira and Tain allegedly submitted or caused Elbia's Pharmacy to submit more than $770,000 in fraudulent billings to Medicare for prescription drugs and other items that were not medically necessary, not prescribed by a doctor, and not provided to Medicare patients.</li> 
<li>Moreira has also been indicted on charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud for his role in the operation of Rx Plus, a durable medical equipment company.</li>
<li>According to the September 2010 indictment, Moreira and a co-conspirator controlled and operated Rx Plus. From August 2008 through April 2009, they allegedly submitted more than $2.5 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare, of which Medicare paid approximately $383,000.</li>
<li>Investigators believe that, in order to avoid detection, Moreira and his co-conspirator recruited a nominee owner (an individual who pretends to be the owner to conceal the actual owner's identity) to use his name on the corporation's paperwork, to open bank accounts, and to sign company checks.</li> 
<li>Moreira was captured on June 7, 2011, at Miami International Airport. Prior to his arrest, Moreira had been living in Cancun, Mexico.</li>

<h2><span class="captured-heading">CAPTURED:</span>  Zoya Belov</h2>

<ul>
<li>On June 30, 2014, Zoya Belov was sentenced to a year-and-a-half in jail and ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution, joint and several, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud. Belov, who with co-conspirators allegedly defrauded the Medicare program, was captured on March 23, 2011 at the San Francisco International Airport.</li>
<li>The purported leader of the conspiracy, Vardges Egiazarian, owned three medical clinics in eastern California (specifically, in Sacramento, Richmond and Carmichael). From February 2006 to August 2008, these clinics allegedly submitted a total of nearly $5.2 million worth of false billings to Medicare, of which Medicare paid approximately $1.5 million. Belov, a medical assistant at the clinics, falsely claimed to have performed medical tests on patients, and requested reimbursements from Medicare, OIG alleges.</li>
<li>The fraud was purportedly accomplished by recruiting and paying third parties to pretend to be "patients" who wished to receive medical treatment at one of the alleged conspirators' clinics. Normally, patients must pay for a certain portion of their medical expenses, and Medicare may pay the remainder. In this fraud, the individuals pretending to be patients were paid by the conspirators to state that they needed medical treatment when they did not. </li>
<li>Belov would allegedly perform unnecessary medical tests on the patients, or fraudulently claim to have performed the tests when she had not. Belov and others then submitted the fraudulent claims to Medicare for medical services that were not performed, not performed as billed, or unnecessary, according to OIG.  </li>
<li>In an attempt to conceal the alleged fraud from Medicare representatives, Belov allegedly lied about the whereabouts and activities of the other conspirators.</li>
