<h2>OIG Fugitive: Luis Emelio Deleon (a.k.a. Sevastion Deleon)</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>In February 2014 a complaint was filed charging Luis Emilio Deleon with health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and aggravated identity theft.  Investigators believe that Deleon received over $800,000 in reimbursement for wound care products that doctors never prescribed and that beneficiaries never ordered or received.</li>
<li>Deleon owned and operated Clover Durable Medical Equipment, LLC (Clover), doing business in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Deleon used the names and NPI numbers of Louisiana doctors as prescribing physicians on Medicare claims for beneficiaries who lived outside the state of Louisiana, primarily in the state of Florida.  Neither the Louisiana physicians nor the out-of-state beneficiaries had any knowledge of Clover.</li>
<li>Prior to Deleon's purchase of the company in 2012, Clover billed Medicare for less than $100,000 per year in DME items.  After Deleon purchased the company, he billed Medicare for more than $2 million in wound care supplies in less than three months.</li>  
<li>Investigators believe that Deleon fled the United States and is believed to be residing in Cuba.</li>

<h2>OIG Fugitive: Conrado Dizon Lopez, Jr.</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>On December 23, 2014, Conrado Lopez was indicted on charges of health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, false claims, false statements related to health care matters, and falsification of records. Lopez is a licensed physical therapist and owner of Total Rehab in Brooklyn, NY.</li>
<li>Lopez confessed to OI Agents that he was knowingly involved and an active participant in a scheme to defraud Medicare and Medicaid whereby Total Rehab submitted claims to these programs for services that were either not rendered, not medically necessary, not appropriately supervised and/or performed by unlicensed individuals. He also stated that on several occasions he was outside the United States on vacation and when he returned, he signed back dated superbills for the dates of services when he gone, despite knowing this was wrong. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, between approximately March 2009 and November 2011, providers at Total Rehab submitted and caused to be submitted approximately $9.8 million in claims to Medicare and approximately $8.6 million in claims to Medicaid. During approximately that same period, Lope was identified as the rendering provider on claims submitted to Medicare totaling approximately $1.8 million and on claims submitted to Medicaid totaling approximately $1 million.</li>
<li>Flight records show that Lopez fled the United States and investigators believe that he is in the Philippines or the United Arab Emirates. He remains a fugitive at-large.</li>

<h2>OIG Fugitive: Armando "Ana" Zamora</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>In July 2004, Armando "Ana" Zamora was indicted on charges of health care fraud conspiracy and health care fraud.  Investigators believe that Zamora and her co-conspirators received approximately $550,000 in reimbursement from Medicare for the cost of durable medical equipment (DME) and other related items and services that were either medically unnecessary or were never provided. </li>
<li>Zamora and Aurora Estevez established Health South Medical Supply Corporation, a DME company in Miami-Dade County, Florida. According to the indictment, Zamora and Estevez used a nominee owner to conceal their control of Health South. Zamora and Estevez acquired, and enlisted a patient recruiter to acquire, Medicare beneficiary information, which Health South allegedly used to prepare fraudulent Medicare claims. The defendants also acquired the identification numbers of doctors to help further the fraud. </li>
<li>Zamora, Estevez, and their co-conspirators falsely represented that doctors had treated patients; that doctors had prescribed DME, including custom-fitted orthotics, and other related items and services for patients; and that such DME had been delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. </li>
<li>Estevez pleaded guilty and was sentenced in January 2005 to 2 years in jail and ordered to pay $505,704 in restitution, joint and several. </li>
<li>Zamora fled the United States and is believed to be residing in Central or South America. She remains a fugitive at large.</li>

<li>In October 2012, Abayomi Onajobi was indicted on charges of health care fraud and aggravated identity theft. Investigators believe that Onajobi and others acting at his direction caused the submission of about $585,000 in fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid.</li>
<li>Onajobi owned and operated Medibay Medical Supply, a durable medical equipment company in Houston, Texas.  From approximately September 2006 to February 2009, Onajobi marketed and supplied beneficiaries with power wheelchairs and "ortho kits" (braces, wraps, supports, heat pad, etc.) that were not prescribed by a physician. Onajobi and his co-conspirators submitted claims for approximately 171 beneficiaries located in Texas and Louisiana, and he received more than $105,000 from Medicare and Medicaid in reimbursement. </li>
<li>Investigators believe that Onajobi fled the country before a warrant could be issued for his arrest. He may be residing in Nigeria, the country of his birth. </li>

<li>Alky jointly operated and controlled Associates in Home Care, Inc.; ABC Home Care, Inc.; and Swift Home Care, LLC.

<ul>
<li>On October 7, 2013, an arrest warrant was issued for Errol Elrington, M.D., for racketeering, Medicaid fraud, and health care fraud.  Investigators believe that Elrington falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid more than $400,000 for services that he never performed, and he employed an unlicensed physician who engaged in criminal sexual misconduct. </li>
<li>According to the Felony Complaint, Elrington was a licensed physician practicing in the Redford, Michigan, area, and was the owner of a private medical center, Elrington Medical Center PLLC (EMC).  Elrington allegedly employed an unlicensed physician to treat patients at EMC when he was not there, then billed Medicare and Medicaid as if he performed the services.  Though he was the owner of EMC, Elrington spent most of his time employed as the chief medical officer at another medical facility that was unaffiliated with EMC.   </li>
<li>The unlicensed physician treated several patients and conducted multiple pelvic exams on a female patient, which resulted in charges of first degree criminal sexual conduct, racketeering, Medicaid fraud, health care fraud, and health profession unauthorized practice.  The unlicensed physician is being held prior to trial. </li>
<li>Elrington fled the United States for Belize less than 24 hours after being interviewed by Federal and State agents. He remains a fugitive at-large.</li>

<ul>
<li>In August 2006, couple Aiza Rodriguez and Daniel Guerra were indicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, commit health care fraud, and pay kickbacks; health care fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering; and money laundering.  Investigators believe that Rodriguez and Guerra received more than $9 million in Medicare reimbursement for durable medical equipment (DME) that either was medically unnecessary or was never delivered to a qualified Medicare beneficiary. </li>
<li>Rodriguez owned the DME company, Brickell Orthopedic Store, Inc., while Guerra owned the DME company, Stephanie Medical Supplies, Corporation.  Both companies were based in Miami, Florida.  According to the indictment, Guerra and Rodriguez paid kickbacks and bribes to patient recruiters in return for providing their companies with Medicare beneficiaries whom they could use to bill Medicare.  The beneficiaries were also paid and bribed in exchange for their Medicare identification numbers along with their prescriptions for DME and related services.  </li>
<li>The defendants fraudulently completed Medicare-required orthotic measurement forms for DME without an orthotist or orthotic fitter ever having measured a patient.  Guerra and Rodriguez then forged the signatures of doctors on DME prescriptions and paid doctors to sign blank certificates of medical necessity. </li>
<li>Rodriguez and Guerra fled the United States shortly after a warrant was issued for their arrest.  They resided outside Madrid, Spain, until they were incarcerated.  U.S. authorities are currently working with the Spanish Government to have the couple extradited to the United States to face charges stemming from their indictment. </li>

<img src="./images/bio-slepak.png" alt="Ilya Slepak" class="rClean" />

<ul>
<li>In October 2011, Ilya Slepak and his co-conspirators were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and health care fraud.  Investigators believe that Slepak and his co-conspirators billed Medicare and private insurance companies millions of dollars for medical care and equipment that was never provided or was medically unnecessary. </li>
<li>Slepak worked as a manager for several "no-fault" medical clinics in New York City, which were owned by Leonid Kaplan.  All vehicles registered in New York State are required to have no-fault automobile insurance, which enables drivers and passengers of a registered vehicle to obtain benefits for injuries sustained in a car accident, regardless of fault.  Kaplan's no-fault clinics purportedly provided medical care and durable medical equipment (DME) to automobile accident victims.  However, these clinics were in fact medical fraud mills that routinely billed Medicare and automobile insurance companies under the no-fault program for medical treatments that were never provided or were medically unnecessary. </li>
<li>Investigators believe that the Kaplan clinics used and paid "runners" to refer "patients" who were in vehicle collisions to the clinics.  Often, these patients suffered few or no injuries and yet obtained weeks or months of medically unnecessary treatments and tests at Kaplan's clinics.  The Kaplan clinics also partnered with a medical supply company to bill Medicare and the insurance companies for purportedly providing durable medical equipment (DME) to patients, even though the DME was medically unnecessary and even though Medicare and the insurance companies were overcharged for the DME. </li>
<li>Slepak and other managers oversaw the daily operations of the clinics, including recruiting and paying corrupt medical practitioners who worked at the clinics, paying runners and patients, supervising the submission of fraudulent billing to insurance companies, and coaching patients on how to describe their injuries in order to maximize insurance payments and legal settlements based upon bogus claims of "serious bodily injury." </li>
<li>Kaplan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud, was sentenced to 7 years and 10 months of incarceration, and was ordered to pay $2.3 million in forfeiture and restitution.  Seven other defendants also pleaded guilty in relation to this fraud scheme.  Slepak remains a fugitive and is believed to be residing in Russia. </li>

<ul>
<li>On November 18, 2014, Miguel Angel Hernandez and Maria Del Pilar Moreira were indicted on charges of conspiracy and health care fraud. Investigators believe that the married couple caused the submission of nearly $7 million in false claims to Medicare.  </li>
<li>Hernandez and Moreira owned and operated East Point Medical Center and Family First Medical Center in Georgia, which purportedly provided physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, and pain management through trigger point injections. According to the indictment, Hernandez and Moreira caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid for medical services that were either medically unnecessary or were not provided. They also billed for expensive trigger point injections (for which Medicare pays between $58 and $60) when, in fact, they actually provided vitamin B-12 shots (for which Medicare pays around $0.66). In addition, the couple billed for medical services on days when they actually drove patients to restaurants for parties.</li>
<li>Hernandez and Moreira directed clinic employees to transport patients by van to the clinics. Beneficiaries were offered massages, cash, gift cards, food, dollar prizes, and raffles for televisions to induce them to visit the clinic on a regular basis. Instead of receiving medical treatment, the patients often participated in group exercises, such as riding a stationary bike, holding a bar and kicking to the left and right, and waving their arms. To further the fraud, the couple hired a medical doctor so they could falsely bill services under his provider name and number. They then caused the submission of false claims for services not rendered by the provider or for services on days when the provider was not at the clinic. </li>
<li>Investigators believe that Hernandez and Moreira fled the country after they became aware of the investigation. Warrants have been issued for their arrest. They are believed to be residing in Spain. </li>

<li>Ortega, Camejo, and Secundino Perez operated and controlled Maidelyn Medical Equipment Corporation, based in Virginia Gardens, Florida.  Maidelyn Medical purportedly provided DME, including wound therapy pumps, to beneficiaries.  According to the indictment, the three defendants submitted and caused the submission of claims to Medicare using the identification information of physicians who had not examined, treated, or prescribed DME to the beneficiaries for whom the claims were being submitted.  Consequently, Medicare provided $972,413 in reimbursement. </li>
<li>On May 7, 2010, Perez was sentenced to 2 years and 7 months in prison and ordered to pay $972,413 in restitution.  Ortego and Camejo remain fugitives at large.  Investigators believe that they may be residing in Cuba. </li>

<ul>
<li>On August 27, 2014, Syed Jawed Akhtar-Zaidi was indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, health care fraud, distribution of controlled substances, and money laundering.  Investigators believe that Akhtar-Zaidi and his co-conspirators billed Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance providers more than $10 million for false medical office visits and prescription drugs that were dispensed without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the usual course of professional practice. </li>
<li>Akhtar-Zaidi was a physician who operated a medical office called Pain Management of Northern Ohio.  According to the indictment, from around September 2009 to around October 2013, Akhtar-Zaidi and his co-conspirators illegally distributed and dispensed thousands of doses of prescription painkillers to customers in the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere.  These prescriptions, primarily for oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and morphine, were dispensed without adequately verifying the patient's identity or medical complaint, without an adequate and reliable medical history, without performing a complete or adequate mental or physical examination, without maintaining complete medical records, without establishing a true diagnosis, and without assessing the risk of abuse for the patients.  </li>
<li>Akhtar-Zaidi used pre-signed blank prescription forms upon which his staff filled in the controlled substance and dosage to be prescribed. Investigators related that he and co-conspirators distributed the controlled substances to patients, knowing that the patients were addicted to drugs, were misusing or abusing drugs, or were requesting additional quantities in order to divert the drugs to others.  Akhtar-Zaidi instructed staff at his office not to report customers to law enforcement whom they suspected of being "drug seeking" and/or "doctor shopping."</li>
<li>Investigators believe that Akhtar-Zaidi fled the United States around December 2013 and may be residing in Pakistan.  He remains a fugitive at-large.</li>

<h2>OIG Fugitive: Etienne Allonce</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>In December 2007, Etienne Allonce and his wife, Helene Michel, were indicted on charges of health care fraud. Allonce and Michel were owners of Medical Solutions Management, Inc. (MSM), a durable medical equipment (DME) company operating out of Hicksville, NY. Tri-State Surgical Supply (Tri-State) is a DME company that has a contract with numerous nursing homes in Long Island, Queens, and Brooklyn, to provide Medicare and Medicaid covered DME supplies to residents. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, MSM employees allegedly posed as sub-contractors for Tri-State in order to gain access to several nursing homes. Once they entered the nursing homes under false pretenses, MSM employees allegedly accessed medical charts (containing private information protected by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA) for residents who required specialized wound care. MSM then allegedly billed Medicare Part B and/or and Medicaid for wound care supplies that were never ordered or provided. </li>
<li>It is also believed that MSM employees stole original documents containing HIPAA information from medical charts in facilities, in order to "manufacture" fraudulent MSM charts in an effort to legitimize their medical billings. </li>
<li>After Michel and Allonce were indicted on health care fraud charges for their participation in the aforementioned scheme, Allonce fled the United States to avoid prosecution and is believed to be residing in Haiti. </li>
<li>In April 2013, Michel was convicted on charges of health care fraud and wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. She was sentenced to 12 years of incarceration and ordered to pay more than $4.4 million in restitution.</li>

<ul>
<li>On May 6, 2008, Marina Nazarova was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and criminal forfeiture.  Investigators believe that Nazarova and her co-conspirators billed Medicare more than $2 million for durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies that either were not provided or were medically unnecessary. </li>
<li>Nazarova was the part owner of the DME company U.S. Medtrade, located in Burbank, California.  </li>
<li>According to court documents, Medtrade allegedly provided a significant amount of DME, more than half its billings, to Medicare beneficiaries who had been determined to be "over utilized," meaning that they received an unusually large amount of Medicare services billed by multiple providers, compared to average Medicare beneficiaries.   Investigators interviewed the top referring physicians who allegedly prescribed DME supplied by Medtrade. The physicians had never heard of Medtrade or used the company for prescribing DME.  </li>
<li>Investigators believe that Nazarova fled the United States and is currently residing in Russia.  Nazarova remains a fugitive. </li>

</div>

<ul>
<li>On December 19, 2013, Dr. Uche Chukwudi was indicted on charges of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.  Investigators believe that Dr. Chukwudi was involved in a scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare approximately $7.3 million for durable medical equipment (DME) that was never provided and was medically unnecessary.</li>
<li>Co-conspirator Adeline Ekwebelem owned Adelco Medical Distributors, a DME supplier in Gardena, California.  According to the indictment, Ekwebelem paid marketers to solicit Medicare beneficiaries and offer them free DME, such as power wheelchairs, hospital beds, and orthotics, that they did not need.  In return for the free products, the beneficiaries agreed to visit certain physicians, including Dr. Chukwudi, who would then use their beneficiary information to create false patient files and false statements in "face-to-face examination" forms. Dr. Chukwudi and other physicians then wrote prescriptions for the DME to be filled at Adelco. </li>
<li>Dr. Chukwudi referred more than 200 Medicare beneficiaries to Adelco for expensive, medically unnecessary DME, which enabled Ekwebelem to falsely bill Medicare for approximately $1.18 million.  Dr. Chukwudi allegedly received cash kickbacks in return for writing the fraudulent prescriptions.</li>
<li>Ekwebelem was convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and paying kickbacks for the recruitment of Medicare beneficiaries.  Dr. Charles Okoye, a physician who referred more than 200 beneficiaries to Adelco, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud.  Both are awaiting sentencing.  Patient recruiters Cindy Santana, Maritza Hernandez, and Romie Tucker, Jr., each pleaded guilty to illegal remunerations for health care referrals.  Hernandez received 9 months in jail, while Santana and Tucker are awaiting sentencing. </li>
<li>Dr. Chukwudi fled the United States prior to his trial in September 2014.  His whereabouts are currently unknown, and he remains a fugitive at-large.   </li>

<img src="./images/bio-grigoryan.png" alt="Nuritsa Grigoryan" />
</div>

<ul>
<li>On February 18, 2014, Nuritsa Grigoryan was convicted on charges of health care fraud conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to misbrand pharmaceutical drugs, false statements to the Federal Government, and conspiracy to use other persons' identification documents in furtherance of fraud.  Grigoryan, along with co-conspirators Dr. Kenneth Johnson and Artak Ovsepian, were found guilty for their roles in a $20 million health care fraud scheme involving fraudulent prescriptions for expensive antipsychotic drugs. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, Grigoryan and her co-conspirators operated Manor Medical Imaging, Inc. (Manor), which functioned as a "prescription mill" that generated thousands of prescriptions for expensive antipsychotic medications.  These drugs purportedly were prescribed by Johnson upon examining the patients.  However, Johnson did not examine the patients, but rather presigned thousands of blank prescription forms that were used by Grigoryan and the others associated with Manor to submit fraudulent claims for prescriptions to Medicare and Medi-Cal.  Grigoryan pretended to be an American doctor when she saw the patients at Manor and  presigned the prescriptions forms. </li>
<li>Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were brought to Manor by patient recruiters and received prescriptions for antipsychotic medications in exchange for cash or other inducements.  Drivers employed by Manor then drove the beneficiaries to pharmacies to have their prescriptions filled.  The drivers then took the medications from the beneficiaries and delivered the drugs to Manor.  Manor also generated prescriptions for beneficiaries who never visited Manor and whose identities were stolen. </li>
<li>Grigoryan was scheduled to be sentenced in June 2014.  She was released after trial and ordered to wear an ankle monitor.  Investigators believe that Grigoryan removed her ankle monitor.  Grigoryan may be residing in a hidden location in the greater Los Angeles area or may have fled to Armenia after recently obtaining travel documents from the Armenian Consulate.  Ovsepian is currently in custody and awaiting sentencing while Johnson is being monitored before being sentenced. </li>

<ul>
<li>On May 3, 2013, brothers Dixan Esteban Barcelo-Castro and Alfredo Barcelo-Rodriguez were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and health care fraud.  Investigators believe that the brothers, along with their co-conspirators, received more than $2.5 million from Medicare for medical procedures and services that were either not performed or were not reimbursable under Medicare rules. </li>
<li>Barcelo-Castro operated and controlled four purported health care clinics in Tampa, Florida:  Palmetto General Health Care Inc. (Palmetto), United Healthcare Center Inc., New Imaging Center Inc., and Lord Physical Rehabilitation Center, Inc. (Lord Physical).   Barcelo-Rodriguez participated in the establishment and operation of these clinics and was listed as the President of Palmetto and Lord Physical. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, all four clinics allegedly billed Medicare Part C Health Maintenance Organizations for endovenous ablation therapy that was never performed or not medically necessary.  This therapy is a minor surgical procedure used to treat problems with blood circulation, such as in the main veins in the legs.  It offers a relatively high rate of Medicare reimbursement.  However, Medicare only covers this procedure when it is medically necessary, not for purely cosmetic procedures, such as the treatment of non-symptomatic varicose or spider veins. </li>
<li>All four clinics supposedly operated at the same address, and at the same time billed Medicare for the same procedures for the same patients.  Barcelo-Castro, Barcelo Rodriguez, and their co-conspirators allegedly recruited and enrolled Medicare beneficiaries to visit the clinics, and in some cases, submit to minor cosmetic procedures that were not reimbursable by Medicare.  The defendants then fraudulently billed Medicare $4,872,239 and used the reimbursed funds for their personal gain.  </li>
<li>Authorities believe that Barcelo-Castro and Barcelo-Rodriguez fled the United States after a warrant was issued for their arrest.  They remain at-large.  </li>

</div>

<ul>
<li>From approximately February 2004 until February 2010, Poul Thorsen executed a scheme to steal grant money awarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  CDC had awarded grant money to Denmark for research involving infant disabilities, autism, genetic disorders, and fetal alcohol syndrome.  CDC awarded the grant to fund studies of the relationship between autism and the exposure to vaccines, the relationship between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy, and the relationship between developmental outcomes and fetal alcohol exposure. </li>
<li>Thorsen worked as a visiting scientist at CDC, Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, before the grant was awarded. </li>
<li>The initial grant was awarded to the Danish Medical Research Council.  In approximately 2007, a second grant was awarded to the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation.  Both agencies are governmental agencies in Denmark.  The research was done by the Aarhaus University and Odense University Hospital in Denmark.</li>
<li>Thorsen allegedly diverted over $1 million of the CDC grant money to his own personal bank account.  Thorsen submitted fraudulent invoices on CDC letterhead to medical facilities assisting in the research for reimbursement of work allegedly covered by the grants.  The invoices were addressed to Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital.  The fact that the invoices were on CDC letterhead made it appear that CDC was requesting the money from Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital although the bank account listed on the invoices belonged to Thorsen.</li>
<li>In April 2011, Thorsen was indicted on 22 counts of Wire Fraud and Money Laundering. </li>
<li>According to bank account records, Thorsen purchased a home in Atlanta, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, an Audi automobile, and a Honda SUV with funds that he received from the CDC grants.  </li>
<li>Thorsen is currently in Denmark and is awaiting extradition to the United States. </li>

<h2>OIG Fugitive: Abubakar Durrani</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>In October 2013, Abubakar Durrani was indicted on charges of health care fraud, false statements related to health care matters, mail fraud, and illegal drug distribution.  Investigators believe that Durrani, an orthopedic spine surgeon, billed Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance companies millions for spinal surgeries and related services that were not medically necessary and were potentially harmful to patients. </li>
<li>Durrani owned the Center for Advanced Spine Technologies (CAST), which had offices in Ohio and Kentucky.  According to the indictment, Durrani falsely diagnosed Medicare patients with spinal-related medical conditions and then persuaded the patients to undergo surgery, even though the patients did not need surgery.  Durrani often told patients that the medical situation was urgent and that surgery was needed right away or they would be at risk of suffering from grave injuries.  For cervical spine patients, Durrani often told patients that there was a risk of paralysis or the head would fall off if the patient was in a car accident because there was almost nothing attaching the head to the patient's body.</li>
<li>Durrani either ignored or never read patient radiology reports; rather he provided his own reading, which was either inconsistent with or contrary to the reports written by the radiologists.  Durrani also ordered pain injections that were inconsistent with either the pain stated by the patient or from the imaging reports. </li>
<li>Durrani dictated his operative reports and other patient records months after the actual treatments.  These reports and records contained false statements about the diagnoses of the patients, the procedures performed, and the instrumentations used in the procedures.  In addition, Durrani failed to inform his patients of complications experienced during the surgeries. </li>
<li>According to the indictment, many patients treated by Durrani for back and neck pain were left in worse shape because of the unnecessary surgeries he performed.  </li>
<li>Investigators believe that Durrani fled the United States while awaiting trial after the court denied his request for permission to travel outside the country.  He may be residing in Pakistan.  </li>

Galstyan, Ghazaryan, and Movsisyan, along with their co-conspirators, allegedly billed Medicare, using stolen provider identities, for more than $40 million in false claims for services that were never rendered.</li>
<li>According to the indictment, Galstyan, Ghazaryan, Movsisyan and their co-conspirators allegedly stole personal identifying information of physicians and Medicare beneficiaries to submit claims to Medicare for equipment for beneficiaries whom the physicians never saw.  They also allegedly employed visa holders from eastern European countries and used the visa holders' identities to submit false claims to Medicare for services never rendered.</li>
<li>Although the crime ring was based in the Los Angeles area, investigators believe that the trio and their co-conspirators traveled throughout the country to open fake businesses. These "false fronts" were opened in over 40 States and were located far from the physicians' actual practices in order to conceal the false billings from the physicians. The locations served as "mail drops" so that the conspirators could receive documents used to further the scheme, including Medicare correspondence and bank checks, according to the indictment.</li>
<li>Investigators believe that the trio and their co-conspirators received more than $19 million in reimbursements from Medicare for services that were never provided. A large portion of the profits from the alleged schemes were laundered through shell businesses owned by the visa holders, according to the indictment.</li>
<li>Co-conspirators Eduard Oganesyan and Karen Chilyan previously pled guilty and were sentenced to 11 years' and 8 years' incarceration, respectively. In addition, Oganesyan and Chilyan were ordered to pay joint and several restitution in the amounts of $10.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively.  A third co-conspirator, Arus Gyulbudakyan, also previously pled guilty and was sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay $500,000 in restitution, joint and several.

<ul>
<li>In May 2009, Ehsan Rana and his co-conspirators were indicted on charges of Health Care Fraud and Criminal Forfeiture. Investigators believe that Rana and his co-conspirators received more than $5.5 million in fraudulent claims from Medicare for physical and occupational therapy services and treatment that were never provided or were medically unnecessary. </li>
<li>Rana was the owner and operator of Alternative Physical Therapy, a Michigan-based company that purportedly provided physical and occupational therapy services and treatment to Medicare providers.</li>
<li>Rana and his accomplices also allegedly established several fictitious companies in an effort to conceal the money and assets gained from the scheme.</li>
<li>According to court documents, from July 2003 through March 2007, Rana's accomplices allegedly created physical and occupational therapy files using information that they purchased or stole from Medicare beneficiaries, and then sold the files to Rana. Investigators believe that Rana and his accomplices paid doctors and therapists to sign fictitious files indicating that services were needed or were provided. Rana and others used their businesses, including Alternative Physical Therapy, to submit approximately $9 million in false physical and occupational therapy claims to Medicare, seeking payment for medical services and treatment that were not provided. </li>
<li>After the Pakistan-born Rana was confronted about his participation in the scheme, he fled the United States and remains at large. </li>

Dr. Gupta and his associates allegedly received approximately $25 million in reimbursements from Medicaid and private health insurers for medical services that were either unnecessary or not performed.</li>
<li>Dr. Gupta owned and operated the Nutrition Clinic, a weight loss clinic with several locations in Northern Illinois and the Chicago metropolitan area. According to the arrest warrant, the clinic required new patients to undergo medical tests, such as thyroid ultrasounds and echocardiograms, without regard to medical necessity for the tests. The Nutrition Clinic would then submit claims to Medicaid and private insurance companies, indicating that these tests were related to a specific medical diagnosis.</li>
<li>The clinic also allegedly submitted claims for "evaluation and management" services performed by Dr. Gupta, when in actuality neither Dr. Gupta nor any other medical doctor saw these patients. In addition, investigators found that Dr. Gupta directed office staff to enlist insured patients for additional procedures, such as "nuclear stress tests" that were not medically necessary. The clinic would then bill the patients, Medicaid, and private insurers for those services. </li>
<li>Authorities believe that Gupta is currently residing in India.</li>

TriStar and S.U.B. allegedly provided outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech pathology services to patients. M&M and HOR allegedly hired and maintained licensed and unlicensed therapists to provide physical and occupational therapy to patients.    </li>
<li>Investigators believe that from January 2003 through March 2007, Hanif and his co-conspirators paid Medicare beneficiaries to sign Medicare reimbursement forms for medical treatments and services at their businesses that were actually not provided or were medically unnecessary. Through their companies, Hanif and his co-conspirators then fraudulently filed reimbursement forms with Medicare, seeking over $18 million in payment for these false medical services and treatments.</li>
<li>Hanif fled the United States once he was confronted about his participation in the scheme, and he remains at large. Co-conspirators Muhammad Azeem and Anupal Gayen also fled the United States and remain fugitives. Co-conspirators Suresh Chand, Jaquita Lovelace, Syed Aziz, Solomon Nathaniel, Jay Jha, Baskaran Thangarasan, and Sandeep Aggarwal each pleaded guilty and were sentenced to a combined 22 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $9.7 million in restitution, joint and several. </li>

<ul>
<li>In April 2008, Gustavo Adolfo Smith was convicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, health care fraud, submission of false claims, and money laundering. </li>
<li>According to court records, from February 2005 to May 2007, Smith owned and operated MedStar Services, a durable medical equipment (DME) company in the Miami area. Smith was responsible for submitting more than $2.9 million in bills to Medicare for medical equipment that was never provided to Medicare beneficiaries. From these claims submissions, Smith received approximately $1.5 million from Medicare. </li>
<li>Smith persuaded his associates to register as the president and registered agents of MedStar so he could remain hidden to operate the fraudulent scheme. Smith maintained the majority of control over MedStar and he attempted to launder proceeds from his fraudulent claims by withdrawing and wire-transferring approximately $200,000 to a bank in Canada.</li>
<li>After being convicted, Smith was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device while awaiting sentencing. On June 14, 2008, Smith's monitoring device set off an alert; authorities responding to the alert were unable to locate Smith. Later on the same day, authorities learned that Smith had boarded a flight from Miami to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</li>

<h2>OIG Fugitive: Oleg Kheyson</h2>
<ul class="simplegray">
<li>Between September 2006 and July 2010, in the Eastern District of New York and elsewhere, Oleg Kheyson and others participated in a scheme to defraud Medicare, a U.S. Government-sponsored health care program.  It is alleged that during the time of the conspiracy and scheme to defraud Medicare, Best Equipment submitted fraudulent claims in the amount of approximately $1.28 million.</li>
<li>Kheyson was a co-owner of Best Equipment, a medical provider certified (or otherwise authorized) to provide medical supplies to Medicare patients at a location on West 1st Street in Brooklyn.  In 2008, Kheyson and others requested to add a second Best Equipment site on Brighton 13th Street; Medicare rejected this application, and thus Kheyson was never authorized to treat patients from the Brighton 13th Street site.  However, despite this rejection, our evidence shows that from 2006 through July 2010, Kheyson and others billed Medicare for thousands of services from the unauthorized Brighton 13th Street site by submitting the claims through his certified location on West 1st Street.</li>
<li>Kheyson and others also defrauded Medicare by submitting fraudulent claims for orthopedic insoles.  In order for Best Equipment to receive reimbursement for orthopedic insoles, the Medicare patient had to have a shoe that was an integral part of a leg brace that was covered by Medicare.</li>
<li>However, upon review of billing data for whom Best Equipment claimed it provided orthopedic insoles, none of the patients received orthopedic shoes or leg braces from Best Equipment or any other Medicare provider; therefore, all of the claims for orthopedic insoles were considered fraudulent.</li>
