Carlos Benitez, Luis Benitez,<br /> Jose Benitez 
</h1>

<p class="charge">Allegedly schemed to defraud about $110 million from Medicare</p>

<p>Carlos, Luis, and Jose Benitez, commonly referred to as the Benitez brothers, lived and conducted business in south Florida from 2001 through 2004.  During that time, OIG alleges the brothers concocted a scheme to submit false and fraudulent claims to Medicare totaling approximately $110 million.</p>
<p>The Benitez brothers owned and directed a string of medical clinics in the Miami area, purportedly providing infusion treatments to HIV-infected Medicare beneficiaries. But the medication the brothers provided to patients was either medically unnecessary or was never actually administered.  The brothers paid kickbacks to patients in exchange for the patients’ Medicare information, which the Benitez brothers then used to submit false claims to the Federal government for reimbursement.  </p>
<p>More than 20 co-conspirators of the Benitez brothers have been charged in the Southern District of Florida for assisting the HIV-infusion fraud conspiracy.  Most of the co-conspirators have pleaded guilty or have been convicted by a jury.  A physician involved in the conspiracy was sentenced to a record-setting 30 years in prison.</p>
