<h1><a name="begin_content"></a>OIG Fugitive: Eduardo Moreno</h1>


<p class="charge">Allegedly stole $7.8 million in 1 year</p>

<p>OIG says Eduardo Moreno sold durable medical equipment (DME) from twenty companies he owned and also operated an infusion clinic, allegedly stealing up to $7.8 million in a single year.  </p>
<p>OIG says that under this Miami-based scheme, Moreno (who sometimes used the alias Pedro Alvarez) would set up a fake DME company using empty storefronts, and rent equipment so he could pass inspection by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.  Then, he would close down that company and open another under a different name.  He bought and sold patient and physician information to bill for services and equipment he never provided.</p>
<p>Living a lavish lifestyle, Moreno drove a Rolls Royce that was later seized under asset forfeiture.  OIG investigators said they followed the money to his Rolls Royce dealership.  Investigators also said that Moreno paid bills (including house payments) for his "nominee" owners.  A nominee owner is an individual who has the appearance of ownership of property, but acts on behalf of the actual owner - in this case, Moreno -- solely to conceal the identity of the actual owner.  </p>
<p>Moreno was indicted in April 2007 and picked by the Miami Police Department on an open warrant.  He failed to appear in court and current whereabouts are unknown.  </p>
