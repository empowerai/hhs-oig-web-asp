<h1><a name="begin_content"></a>OIG Fugitive: Leonard Nwafor</h1>

<p class="charge">Billed Medicare $1.1 million in false claims, collecting<br />over $525K.</p>

<p>Through his durable medical equipment (DME) company Pacific City Medical Equipment, Nwafor and his co-conspirators billed Medicare for $1.1 million and collected $525,000 in fraudulent claims for such things as motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and hospital beds for beneficiaries.  Based in the Los Angeles area, Nwafor used physicians’ Unique Provider Identification Numbers in order to bill Medicare for the equipment, even though those doctors did not examine Nwafor’s clients.  This investigation was led by the DME Strike Force, which included OIG investigators, created to identify and prosecute fraudulent DME companies and laboratories in the Greater Los Angeles area.</p>  

<p>In fall 2008, a jury convicted Nwafor of conspiracy and health care fraud.  He was to be sentenced in January 2009 but failed to show up in court.  In March 2010, Nwafor was sentenced in absentia to 9 years in federal prison and ordered to pay back over $525,000 to Medicare. </p>
