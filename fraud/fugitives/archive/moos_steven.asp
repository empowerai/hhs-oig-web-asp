<h1><a name="begin_content"></a>OIG Fugitive: Dr. Steven Moos</h1>

<p class="charge">Charged with drug possession, fraudulent internet marketing, and child endangerment</p>

<p>Dr. Steven Moos was a general practice physician in Oregon who lost his medical license after he repeatedly prescribed numerous prescription drugs over the internet, despite warnings from the State medical authorities to stop such practices.  According to the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners, Moos prescribed drugs and refilled prescriptions without ever physically examining the customers or obtaining health record information from them or their primary care providers.  Even after his medical license was revoked, Moos allegedly continued to practice medicine and prescribe drugs and made false statements on a Drug Enforcement Agency registration renewal application to conceal the fact that he no longer had a medical license to prescribe drugs.</p>
<p>In addition, in summer 2002, Moos allegedly ordered misbranded drugs (including human growth hormone) from China.  The drugs allegedly did not have the adequate directions for use or warnings and other required information.  </p>
<p>In February 2010, Moos was arrested and found guilty in the United Arab Emirates for impersonating a physician and performing surgery in his villa. He was sentenced to 2 months in prison, but also faces other charges in another part of UAE.  U.S. authorities are working with UAE officials to bring Moos back to the U.S. for trial in this country.</p>
