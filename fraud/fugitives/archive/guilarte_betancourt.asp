<p class="charge">Allegedly defrauded Medicare of nearly $4.3 million (submitted $9.1 million in false and fraudulent claims)</p>

<p>OIG is tracking down sisters Clara and Caridad Guilarte and Reynel Betancourt in connection with the operation of the Dearborn Medical and Rehabilitation Center (DMRC) in Michigan. All three fugitives have outstanding arrest warrants for various offenses, including health care fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering offenses.</p>
<p>OIG says the Guilarte sisters set up and operated DMRC, an infusion therapy clinic, where Betancourt was an employee.  The Guilarte sisters and Betancourt recruited and paid cash and other inducements to Medicare beneficiaries to visit DMRC and sign forms indicating they received legitimate medical services, including injections and infusions of expensive medications, although the services allegedly were never provided. From December 2005 through February 2007, the Guilarte sisters and Betancourt submitted about $9 million worth of false and fraudulent claims to Medicare.  Medicare paid about $4 million based upon those claims, which the Guilarte sisters transferred to sham companies they and others owned and controlled.</p>
<p>The Guilarte sisters, who have no formal medical training, are also known to have operated similar clinics in Florida.  The two have family in the Miami area.</p>
<p>They all have Florida driver’s licenses, and Betancourt has a commercial permit and has been known to work as a truck driver.</p>
<p>All three are originally from Cuba:  Clara Guilarte is a U.S. citizen, Caridad is a U.S. resident alien and Betancourt is a permanent U.S. resident alien.  </p>
