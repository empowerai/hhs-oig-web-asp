<h2>Post Award Grant Changes</h2>
<p>Requests that require prior approval from the awarding office such as rebudgeting more than 10% of the total approved budget, requesting supplemental funding, conducting a minor alteration/renovation exceeding $150,000, or a personnel change of the Director (See 45 CFR &#167; 75.308) must be submitted in writing (email preferred) to the Grants Management Officer (GMO) and the assigned Program Analyst is to be CC'ed. Only written approvals by an appropriate official as outlined in &#167;75.308(j) are to be considered valid. Approvals not signed by an appropriate official will not be considered binding by or upon OIG. Grantees who take action on the basis of approvals from other officials do so at their own risk.</p>


<h2>Program Income</h2>
<p>Program income earned and disbursed must be reported on the SF-425 using the deduction alternative.  Program income is subject to the payment requirements of 45 CFR &#167;75.305(b)(5); therefore grantees must expend program income before requesting additional Federal payments.  If any funds are received from asset forfeitures please contact GMO on how to report this income.</p>   

<h2>System for Award Management</h2> 
<p>The recipient must maintain the accuracy and currency of information in the System for Award Management (SAM) until the final financial report is submitted as required under this award or the final payment is received, whichever is later. Additionally, this term requires the entity to review and update the information at least annually after the initial registration, and more frequently if required by changes in information or another award term.  For purposes of this award term, SAM means the Federal repository into which an entity must provide information required for the conduct of business as a recipient.
