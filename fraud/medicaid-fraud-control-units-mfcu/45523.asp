<p class="standout">Effective March 25, 2011, section 455.23 has been revised to read as follows:</p>

<p>&#167;455.23 Suspension of payments in cases of fraud.</p>


<p>(a) Basis for suspension. (1) The State Medicaid agency must suspend all Medicaid
payments to a provider after the agency determines there is a credible allegation of fraud for
which an investigation is pending under the Medicaid program against an individual or entity
unless the agency has good cause to not suspend payments or to suspend payment only in part.</p>

<p>(2) The State Medicaid agency may suspend payments without first notifying the
provider of its intention to suspend such payments.</p>

<p>(3) A provider may request, and must be granted, administrative review where State law
so requires.</p>

<p>(b) Notice of suspension. (1) The State agency must send notice of its suspension of
program payments within the following timeframes:</p>

<p>(i) Five days of taking such action unless requested in writing by a law enforcement
agency to temporarily withhold such notice.</p>


<p>(ii) Thirty days if requested by law enforcement in writing to delay sending such notice,
which request for delay may be renewed in writing up to twice and in no event may exceed 90
days.</p>

<p>(2) The notice must include or address all of the following:</p>

<p>(i) State that payments are being suspended in accordance with this provision.</p>

<p>(ii) Set forth the general allegations as to the nature of the suspension action, but need
not disclose any specific information concerning an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>(iii) State that the suspension is for a temporary period, as stated in paragraph (c) of this
section, and cite the circumstances under which the suspension will be terminated.</p>

<p>(iv) Specify, when applicable, to which type or types of Medicaid claims or business
units of a provider suspension is effective.</p>

<p>(v) Inform the provider of the right to submit written evidence for consideration by State
Medicaid Agency.</p>

<p>(vi) Set forth the applicable State administrative appeals process and corresponding
citations to State law.</p>

<p>(c) Duration of suspension. (1) All suspension of payment actions under this section will
be temporary and will not continue after either of the following:</p>

<p>(i) The agency or the prosecuting authorities determine that there is insufficient evidence
of fraud by the provider.</p>

<p>(ii) Legal proceedings related to the provider's alleged fraud are completed.</p>

<p>(2) A State must document in writing the termination of a suspension including, where
applicable and appropriate, any appeal rights available to a provider.</p>

<p>(d) Referrals to the Medicaid fraud control unit. (1) Whenever a State Medicaid agency
investigation leads to the initiation of a payment suspension in whole or part, the State Medicaid
Agency must make a fraud referral to either of the following:</p>

<p>(i) To a Medicaid fraud control unit established and certified under part 1007 of this title;
or</p>

<p>(ii) In States with no certified Medicaid fraud control unit, to an appropriate law
enforcement agency.</p>

<p>(2) The fraud referral made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must meet all of the
following requirements:</p>

<p>(i) Be made in writing and provided to the Medicaid fraud control unit not later than the
next business day after the suspension is enacted.</p>

<p>(ii) Conform to fraud referral performance standards issued by the Secretary.</p>

<p>(3)(i) If the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement agency accepts the
fraud referral for investigation, the payment suspension may be continued until such time as the
investigation and any associated enforcement proceedings are completed.</p>

<p>(ii) On a quarterly basis, the State must request a certification from the Medicaid fraud
control unit or other law enforcement agency that any matter accepted on the basis of a referral
continues to be under investigation thus warranting continuation of the suspension.</p>

<p>(4) If the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement agency declines to accept
the fraud referral for investigation the payment suspension must be discontinued unless the State
Medicaid agency has alternative Federal or State authority by which it may impose a suspension
or makes a fraud referral to another law enforcement agency. In that situation, the provisions of
paragraph (d)(3) of this section apply equally to that referral as well.</p>


<p>(5) A State's decision to exercise the good cause exceptions in paragraphs (e) or (f) of
this section not to suspend payments or to suspend payments only in part does not relieve the
State of the obligation to refer any credible allegation of fraud as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of
this section.</p>

<p>(e) Good cause not to suspend payments. A State may find that good cause exists not to
suspend payments, or not to continue a payment suspension previously imposed, to an individual
or entity against which there is an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud if any of the
following are applicable:</p>

<p>(1) Law enforcement officials have specifically requested that a payment suspension not
be imposed because such a payment suspension may compromise or jeopardize an investigation.</p>

<p>(2) Other available remedies implemented by the State more effectively or quickly
protect Medicaid funds.</p>

<p>(3) The State determines, based upon the submission of written evidence by the
individual or entity that is the subject of the payment suspension, that the suspension should be
removed.</p>

<p>(4) Recipient access to items or services would be jeopardized by a payment suspension
because of either of the following:</p>

<p>(i) An individual or entity is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential
specialized services in a community.</p>

<p>(ii) The individual or entity serves a large number of recipients within a
HRSA-designated medically underserved area.</p>

<p>(5) Law enforcement declines to certify that a matter continues to be under investigation
per the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p>


<p>(6) The State determines that payment suspension is not in the best interests of the
Medicaid program.</p>

<p>(f) Good cause to suspend payment only in part. A State may find that good cause exists
to suspend payments in part, or to convert a payment suspension previously imposed in whole to
one only in part, to an individual or entity against which there is an investigation of a credible
allegation of fraud if any of the following are applicable:</p>

<p>(1) Recipient access to items or services would be jeopardized by a payment suspension
in whole or part because of either of the following:</p>

<p>(i) An individual or entity is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential
specialized services in a community.</p>

<p>(ii) The individual or entity serves a large number of recipients within a
HRSA-designated medically underserved area.</p>

<p>(2) The State determines, based upon the submission of written evidence by the
individual or entity that is the subject of a whole payment suspension, that such suspension
should be imposed only in part.</p>

<p>(3)(i) The credible allegation focuses solely and definitively on only a specific type of
claim or arises from only a specific business unit of a provider; and</p>

<p>(ii) The State determines and documents in writing that a payment suspension in part
would effectively ensure that potentially fraudulent claims were not continuing to be paid.</p>

<p>(4) Law enforcement declines to certify that a matter continues to be under investigation
per the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p>

<p>(5) The State determines that payment suspension only in part is in the best interests of
the Medicaid program.</p>

<p>(g) Documentation and record retention. State Medicaid agencies must meet the
following requirements:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain for a minimum of 5 years from the date of issuance all materials
documenting the life cycle of a payment suspension that was imposed in whole or part, including
the following:</p>

<p>(i) All notices of suspension of payment in whole or part.</p>

<p>(ii) All fraud referrals to the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement
agency.</p>

<p>(iii) All quarterly certifications of continuing investigation status by law enforcement.</p>

<p>(iv) All notices documenting the termination of a suspension.</p>

<p>(2)(i) Maintain for a minimum of 5 years from the date of issuance all materials
documenting each instance where a payment suspension was not imposed, imposed only in part,
or discontinued for good cause.</p>

<p>(ii) This type of documentation must include, at a minimum, detailed information on the
basis for the existence of the good cause not to suspend payments, to suspend payments only in
part, or to discontinue a payment suspension and, where applicable, must specify how long the
State anticipates such good cause will exist.</p>

<p>(3) Annually report to the Secretary summary information on each of following:</p>

<p>(i) Suspension of payment, including the nature of the suspected fraud, the basis for
suspension, and the outcome of the suspension.</p>

<p>(ii) Situation in which the State determined good cause existed to not suspend payments,
to suspend payments only in part, or to discontinue a payment suspension as described in this
section, including describing the nature of the suspected fraud and the nature of the good cause.</p>
