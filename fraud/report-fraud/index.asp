              <p>If you prefer, you may provide your complaint anonymously.

					<div class="acc_container">

							<p>
An OIG analyst will review your complaint for relevance and completeness. Not all complaints result in an investigation.
</p>
<p>
If you have identified yourself, a reviewing official may contact you for further information.
</p>
<p>
The OIG Hotline is not authorized to disclose any information on records in its possession: the Hotline will not be able to confirm receipt of your complaint or respond to any inquiries about action taken on your complaint. We understand the natural inclination to follow up on a report but the OIG does not provide the status of complaints. 
</p>
<p>
You have the option, however, of requesting records through the OIG <a href="/foia/index.asp">Freedom of Information Act </a>  officer. Remember to phrase your request in terms of a search for records pertinent to your complaint, not status. You should wait at least six months before filing such a request.
</p>
<p>
If your purpose in filing a complaint is in part to gain some type of relief &mdash; such as obtaining a refund from a Medicare-participating provider or qualifying for benefits from an HHS-funded program &mdash; we strongly advise that you pursue other administrative or judicial remedies. OIG rarely intervenes in personal or civil grievances.
