Iowa Hospital Settles Case Involving a Patient Dumping Allegations</dt>
<dd>On January 17, 2017, Covenant Medical Center (Covenant) in Waterloo, Iowa, entered into a $100,000 Settlement Agreement with OIG.  The Settlement Agreement resolves allegations that Covenant violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act when it failed to provide an appropriate psychiatric screening examination or stabilizing treatment for three patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) when an on-call psychiatrist was available.  A woman presented to the ED complaining of depression and suicidal thoughts, but was later discharged with instructions to follow-up with her primary care physician.  A child presented to the ED following violent outbursts, but was later discharged with instructions to follow-up with his primary care physician.  A man presented to the ED stating his mind was "disturbed," but later eloped from the ED into single degree weather wearing paper scrubs while his discharge was processed.  His body was found about 300 feet from Covenant with the cause of death attributed to hypothermia.  Senior Counsel Henry Green and Associate Counsel Madeline Bainer represented OIG.</dd>

New Jersey Dentist Agrees to $1.1 Million Payment and 50-Year Exclusion To Settle Civil Monetary Penalty Case</dt>
<dd>Roben Brookhim, an unlicensed Dentist in New Jersey, agreed to pay $1,134,000 for allegedly violating the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and agreed to be excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for a period of fifty years under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a and 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(7). OIG alleged that Brookhim owned, controlled, and managed Associated Dental NP, LLC (ADNP), a New Jersey dental practice with multiple locations, in violation of his exclusion from Federal health care program participation in August 2000.  OIG further alleged that as part of his fraud scheme, Brookhim assumed the identity of a licensed New Jersey dentist (Dentist A), to provide services to ADNP patients.  Brookhim assumed Dentist A's identity because Brookhim's license to practice dentistry was suspended in 1999 and revoked in 2004.  OIG contends that Brookhim presented claims for services to various New Jersey Medicaid Managed Care Organizations identifying Dentist A as having providing services; in fact, Dentist A never rendered services to ADNP patients.  Brookhim continued to pose as Dentist A and submit claims in his name -- even after Dentist A died. Senior Counsels David Blank and Michael Torrisi represented OIG with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Mariel Filtz.  <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2017/50year.asp">News Release</a></dd>

<dd>On December 22, 2016, McLeod Medical Center (MMC), a small hospital located in Dillon, South Carolina, entered into a $20,000 settlement agreement with OIG.

Missouri Hospital Settles Case Involving Patient Dumping Allegations</dt>
<dd>On November 28, 2016, Research Medical Center (RMC) in Kansas City, Missouri, entered into a $360,000 settlement agreement with OIG.

The patient presented to RMC's Emergency Department (ED) with a psychiatric emergency medical condition.  Without providing stabilizing treatment, RMC transferred the patient to a nearby facility by private vehicle; en route, the patient exited the vehicle and was struck by another vehicle.  RMC self-disclosed the incident involving this patient.  Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that RMC implemented a transfer policy applicable to patients who presented to RMC's ED with psychiatric emergency medical conditions that also resulted in multiple violations of EMTALA.  Specifically, OIG found seventeen occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate medical screening examinations and improperly transferred or discharged, without providing stabilizing treatment, patients who presented to RMC's ED with psychiatric emergency medical conditions.  At the time each patient presented, RMC had the capacity to treat, stabilize, or admit each patient.  Senior Counsel Geeta Taylor represented OIG. </dd>
