Iowa Hospital Settles Case Involving a Patient Dumping Allegations</dt>
<dd>On January 17, 2017, Covenant Medical Center (Covenant) in Waterloo, Iowa, entered into a $100,000 Settlement Agreement with OIG.

A woman presented to the ED complaining of depression and suicidal thoughts, but was later discharged with instructions to follow-up with her primary care physician.  A child presented to the ED following violent outbursts, but was later discharged with instructions to follow-up with his primary care physician.  A man presented to the ED stating his mind was "disturbed," but later eloped from the ED into single degree weather wearing paper scrubs while his discharge was processed.  His body was found about 300 feet from Covenant with the cause of death attributed to hypothermia.  Senior Counsel Henry Green and Associate Counsel Madeline Bainer represented OIG.</dd>

New Jersey Dentist Agrees to $1.1 Million Payment and 50-Year Exclusion To Settle Civil Monetary Penalty Case</dt>
<dd>Roben Brookhim, an unlicensed Dentist in New Jersey, agreed to pay $1,134,000 for allegedly violating the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and agreed to be excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for a period of fifty years under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a and 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(7). OIG alleged that Brookhim owned, controlled, and managed Associated Dental NP, LLC (ADNP), a New Jersey dental practice with multiple locations, in violation of his exclusion from Federal health care program participation in August 2000.  OIG further alleged that as part of his fraud scheme, Brookhim assumed the identity of a licensed New Jersey dentist (Dentist A), to provide services to ADNP patients.  Brookhim assumed Dentist A's identity because Brookhim's license to practice dentistry was suspended in 1999 and revoked in 2004.  OIG contends that Brookhim presented claims for services to various New Jersey Medicaid Managed Care Organizations identifying Dentist A as having providing services; in fact, Dentist A never rendered services to ADNP patients.  Brookhim continued to pose as Dentist A and submit claims in his name -- even after Dentist A died. Senior Counsels David Blank and Michael Torrisi represented OIG with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Mariel Filtz.  <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2017/50year.asp">News Release</a></dd>

<dd>On December 22, 2016, McLeod Medical Center (MMC), a small hospital located in Dillon, South Carolina, entered into a $20,000 settlement agreement with OIG.

At that point the mother left with her son and later took him to another hospital for evaluation and treatment.  Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.</dd>

Without providing stabilizing treatment, RMC transferred the patient to a nearby facility by private vehicle; en route, the patient exited the vehicle and was struck by another vehicle.

Specifically, OIG found seventeen occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate medical screening examinations and improperly transferred or discharged, without providing stabilizing treatment, patients who presented to RMC's ED with psychiatric emergency medical conditions.

<dd>On September 13, 2016, HMA Fentress County General Hospital, LLC f/d/b/a Jamestown Regional Medical Center (Jamestown), a small hospital in Jamestown, Tennessee, entered into a $10,000 settlement agreement with OIG.

The patient was given antibiotics and pain medication and discharged with a diagnosis of sinusitis.  Upon leaving the ED, the patient used the bathroom and passed blood clots.  She requested the help of a nurse, but the ED doctor said she could come back in the ED for more tests or she could go to another hospital, without providing for an appropriate transfer.

<dd>On September 12, 2016, Public Health Trust of Miami-Dade County, Florida d/b/a Jackson Health System (Jackson), in Miami, Florida, entered into a $50,000 settlement agreement with OIG.  The settlement agreement resolves allegations that Jackson violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to accept the appropriate transfer of a patient who required the specialized capabilities available at Jackson.  OIG's investigation revealed that a hospital in the Virgin Islands (requesting hospital) contacted Jackson and requested to transfer a patient who had a life-threatening Type A Aortic Dissection with Thrombus, which required immediate cardiothoracic surgical intervention.  OIG's investigation revealed that Jackson declined to accept the transfer of the patient unless it received a guarantee of payment.  The requesting hospital obtained the guarantee of payment, but Jackson still declined to accept the transfer because the request needed to be approved by a supervisor who would not be in until the following business day.  A few hours later, the patient died at the requesting hospital.  Under EMTALA, hospitals can be fined up to $50,000 per violation.  Senior Counsel Felicia Heimer represented OIG.</dd>

Webb, MD, a West Virginia psychiatrist, agreed to be excluded from participating in Federal health care programs for a period of ten years under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(7).  OIG alleged that Dr. Webb signed and supplied blank prescriptions and incomplete Certificates of Medical Necessity (CMNs) to durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers to complete and use in support of false claims to Medicare and West Virginia Medicaid for DME without regard for diagnosis or medical necessity.  OIG alleged that the fraudulent prescriptions and CMNs containing Dr. Webb's signature purported to show that Dr. Webb had prescribed and certified the medical necessity and propriety of the DME when, in fact, he had not.  After the initiation of an investigation in this matter, Dr. Webb participated in a scheme to obstruct the investigation by re-signing some of the fraudulent prescriptions and CMNs previously created by the DME supplier and ratifying those prescriptions and CMNs without regard to medical necessity or propriety.  These re-signed claims were placed in patient records in an attempt to avoid having to repay Medicare and West Virginia Medicaid for the payments previously made based on the false claims submitted.  Associate Counsel David Fuchs represented OIG.</dd>

Regional One Health in Tennessee Settles Case Involving a Patient Dumping Allegation  </dt>
<dd>On July 7, 2016, Regional One Health (ROH), in Memphis, Tennessee, entered into a $45,000 settlement agreement with OIG.  The settlement agreement resolves allegations that ROH violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when it failed to provide an adequate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to a patient and inappropriately transferred the patient to another hospital.  The patient presented at ROH with complaints of sudden pain in the lower right quadrant of his abdomen.  OIG's investigation revealed that despite the fact that ROH was aware of the patient's abnormal lactic acid levels and perforated viscus, ROH failed to fully evaluate the severity and cause of the patient's emergency condition and failed to provide the patient stabilizing treatment for sepsis.  Instead, ROH transferred the patient to another hospital, even though ROH was capable of providing the highest level of care to the patient.  OIG contends that the transfer by ROH was inappropriate because the patient was not informed of the risks of transfer, the benefits of transfer did not outweigh the risks, and the transfer unnecessarily cause a delay in the patient's care.  The patient died due to septic shock and respiratory failure within a week of his transfer by ROH.  Under EMTALA, hospitals can be fined up to $50,000 per violation.

<br />South Florida Business Owner Agrees to Voluntary Exclusion and Divestiture</a></dt>
<dd>Tracy Nemerofsky - a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida private business owner - agreed to be excluded from participation in all Federal health care programs for a period of five years.  OIG conducted an investigation of Nemerofsky for knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted to Medicare false claims in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.  Based upon that investigation, OIG alleged that Nemerofsky violated the Anti-Kickback Statute through her company A Plus Home Healthcare, Inc. (A Plus), when she directed and managed A Plus' payments to eight different physicians' spouses, in exchange for the physicians' Medicare referrals.  OIG alleged that the eight spouses were not bona fide employees of A Plus and that these arrangements did not fit within the exception to the Anti-Kickback Statute payment prohibition.  OIG alleged that Nemerofsky offered and paid the remuneration described above and this conduct forms a basis for her exclusion. <br /><br />
Nemerofsky agreed to enter a voluntary exclusion with OIG for a period of five years after she resolved the above mentioned conduct through a False Claims Act monetary settlement with the United States, a settlement in which OIG expressly reserved its exclusion authority.  In order to resolve her companies' exclusion liability as well, Nemerofsky also agreed to divest herself of five health care businesses: A Plus; A Plus Private Care Services; Ocean Therapy Group, Inc.; Professional Touch Rehab, Inc.; and RockHill Rehab Services Inc.

The OIG alleged that Newton Medical Center failed to provide an adequate medical screening examination for a patient who presented to Newton's emergency department 38-weeks pregnant and complaining of abdominal and lower back pain.  Newton did not take the patient's medical history, take any vitals, conduct fetal monitoring, test for fetal movement, or perform any exam on the patient.

<dd>On February 9, 2015, Palms West Hospital (Palms), a Loxahatchee, Florida hospital, agreed to pay a maximum penalty of $50,000 in a settlement agreement with OIG.  The agreement resolves allegations that Palms refused to accept the transfer of a toddler who had ingested Drano.  The mother of an 18-month old toddler brought her daughter to a hospital emergency department (ED) for ingestion of an unknown quantity of Drano.  Poison control recommended that the toddler be treated by a pediatric gastroenterologist (GI), which that hospital did not have.  The ED physician contacted the Hospital Corporation of America's Transfer Center (TC) to arrange a transfer of the patient.  As protocols required, TC had a copy of Palms' on-call list.  TC called Palms to confirm that pediatric GI services were available and to arrange for the transfer of the toddler.  The ED physician at Palms accepted the transfer, but later rescinded the acceptance believing that she had made a mistake about on-call coverage.  As a result, the toddler was transferred to another hospital.  Palms, however, did have a pediatric GI available on call when the request was made to transfer the toddler.  TC failed to check on the transfer request in a timely manner and learned of the refusal after the patient had been transferred to another facility.

Tristar Summit Medical Center in Tennessee Settles Patient Dumping Allegations</dt>
<dd>A hospital in Tennessee that allegedly transferred an unstable patient for insurance reasons will pay $40,000 in a settlement with the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services, it was announced today. Tristar Summit Medical Center in Hermitage, TN is settling allegations by the OIG that it broke the law when it transferred a patient that had come to its emergency department after consuming a bottle of antifreeze without first stabilizing the patient's medical condition. Emergency room personnel, it is alleged, determined the patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit and, despite the availability of a bed in the Tristar Summit ICU, the patient was sent elsewhere because the hospital did not accept the patient's insurance. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) of 1986&mdash;often referred to as the patient anti-dumping law&mdash;requires a hospital to stabilize a patient's emergency condition within its capabilities prior to transfer, and a hospital may not transfer an unstable patient unless the patient requests transfer or a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks. Under EMTALA hospitals can be fined up to $50,000 per violation.</dd>

<br />Atmore Community Hospital Settles EMTALA Case</dt>
<dd>A small hospital in Atmore, Alabama, settled claims that it refused to provide pain medication to a man who had been shot in the arm. The 65-year old man was sent to Atmore Community Hospital via ambulance to be air lifted to a hospital that was capable of treating his injury. However, it was too foggy for the helicopter to land, so the paramedics needed to drive him to the hospital, which was one hour away. The patient did not think he could make the trip without pain medication, so he requested pain relief for his severe pain -  something Atmore had the capability to provide.  As the paramedics unloaded the patient from the ambulance, Atmore's emergency department doctor and a nurse came out to the ambulance and refused to let the patient enter the hospital because they did not have a trauma surgeon on staff.  Both the paramedic and the patient explained that the patient wanted pain relief for the long trip, but the doctor and nurse returned inside, with locked doors closing behind them.  
<br /><br />
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services alleged this conduct violates the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment to patients with emergency medical conditions, including severe pain. On December 29, 2014, Atmore agreed to pay $25,000 - the maximum penalty for a small hospital - to resolve these allegations.  Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.</dd>

EMTALA requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment to anyone with an emergency medical condition. 
The patient came to the emergency room of Memorial North Park, one of Memorial Health Care System's satellite hospitals, with severe pain in his feet, ankles, and right shin after jumping from a twenty foot wall and landing on concrete. Although Memorial had an orthopedic surgeon on call, the emergency room staff did not consult with him nor did they provide treatment for the patient's pain or splint his legs before transferring him to the trauma center. The trauma center ultimately did not consider the patient a trauma case.  <br /><br />

Baptist Medical Center - Princeton Settles EMTALA Case</dt>
<dd>A Birmingham, Alabama, medical center that refused to accept the appropriate transfer of a 61-year-old woman, has agreed to settle allegations that it violated the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act.    EMTALA requires hospitals with specialized capabilities-in this case a neurosurgeon-to accept transfers of patients who require those services. <br /><br />
The patient, who was found to be unresponsive in her home, was initially taken to a facility that did not have the capability to treat her condition.  The hospital diagnosed her with altered mental status caused by a change in brain function: she had a subdural hematoma and needed emergency surgery, which that hospital could not provide. When the ED physician called Baptist to make arrangements to transfer the patient to Baptist, Baptist transferred the call to its ED and the transferring physician was told that he needed to talk to the on-call neurosurgeon.  The call was then forwarded to the Hospitalist, who repeated that he had to speak with the on-call neurosurgeon.  The transferring ED physician was then connected to the neurosurgeon and explained the patient's condition.  The neurosurgeon responded that it sounded like the patient was brain dead.  The ED physician explained that she was not and that he had paralyzed her to intubate her for medical purposes.  The neurosurgeon repeated that she sounded brain dead and refused the transfer.  Before hanging up, the neurosurgeon said he would be willing to consult on the case, but not accept transfer of the patient to Baptist. The ED physician then transferred the patient to another hospital where she successfully underwent surgery and was released to a rehabilitation facility five days later.  Baptist, after finding out about its refusal to accept this patient, ordered the neurosurgeon to call Baptist back and to accept the patient, which he did, but the patient had already been sent to another hospital. <br /><br />
Baptist, on December 29, 2014, agreed to pay $40,000 to resolve allegations of an EMTALA violation investigated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The maximum penalty for violating the so-called "patient dumping" law is $50,000 for a large hospital. Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.</dd>

Caldwell Medical Center, a small hospital in Princeton, Kentucky, has settled allegations that it failed to evaluate a patient's head pain or provide stabilizing treatment.  A 72-year old woman lost consciousness and fell face-first onto a concrete floor.  She regained consciousness about five hours later, called an ambulance, and was taken to Caldwell's Emergency Department (ED).  She had bruising and abrasions on her nose, two black eyes and a skin tear on her right arm.  She complained of severe pain in her face and head.  Her abrasions and skin tear were cleaned and she was discharged home a little over one hour after she arrived in the ED.  She did not receive any diagnostic tests, including a CAT Scan, and she received no treatment for her head pain.<br /><br />
The patient continued to have pain: she could not chew and she vomited blood.  The next morning she called an ambulance again and returned to Caldwell's ED.  This time she received an appropriate medical screening exam, which revealed multiple head fractures.  She was then transferred to a hospital with neurosurgery capabilities and she underwent several surgeries and was discharged thirteen days later.  <br /><br />
Caldwell agreed to pay $10,000 in a settlement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services effective December 29, 2014. Senior Counsel Sandra Sands represented OIG.

<br /><br />
Specifically, the patient came to the DCH emergency department with a gunshot wound in his abdomen region.  The emergency department physician determined that the on-call general surgeon needed to evaluate and treat the patient and the staff contacted the on-call general surgeon multiple times.  The on-call general surgeon indicated that he was performing a previously scheduled elective surgery in the operating room.  DCH's emergency department was unable to find another general surgeon to evaluate and provide stabilizing treatment to the patient.  The on-call general surgeon then performed a second previously scheduled elective surgery in the operating room without first evaluating and providing stabilizing treatment to the patient in the emergency department.  After waiting approximately two hours at DCH, the patient died, never having received an evaluation or stabilizing treatment from a general surgeon.</dd>

Mercy Hospital in Miami, FL Settles EMTALA Case</dt>
<dd>Mercy Hospital - a campus of Plantation General Hospital in Miami, FL - agreed to pay $45,000 to resolve allegations that it failed to provide appropriate medical screening for a 24-day-old baby brought to the hospital's Emergency Department for an emergency medical condition, including persistent low body temperature. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services alleged that Mercy Hospital violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) by failing to provide adequate evaluation and treatment because it did not address the newborn's low temperature nor did it order any further laboratory tests, such as a blood count, blood chemistry lab, or urinalysis, before telling the parents to take the baby home. Minutes after leaving the hospital, the baby suffered cardiac arrest, kidney injury and potential injury to the brain from lack of oxygen because of an issue with the bowel, known as necrotic bowel. OIG contends that EMTALA is intended to protect vulnerable patients such as newborn babies who cannot articulate their own needs, and medical professionals must consider appropriate diagnostic techniques and adequately listen to family members presenting the baby's chief symptoms.</dd>
