<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) enters into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) and Integrity Agreements (IAs) with health care providers and other entities as part of the settlement of Federal health care program investigations arising under a variety of civil false claims statutes.  The CIA/IA breach and default provisions allow the OIG to impose certain monetary penalties (referred to as Stipulated Penalties) for the failure to comply with certain obligations set forth in the CIA/IA.  In addition, a material breach of the CIA/IA constitutes an independent basis for the provider's exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs. </p>
