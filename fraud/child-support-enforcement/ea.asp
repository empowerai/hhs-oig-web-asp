<h2>Captured Fugitives Owed More Than $1.4 Million in Child Support&nbsp;Payments</h2>


<p>A notably successful child support enforcement initiative came together in Orange County, New York.  "Operation OC Deadbeats" is a multijurisdictional effort to locate, arrest, and bring to trial county residents who knowingly fail to make support payments for their children. </p>
<p>"The Federal law enforcement collaboration with Orange County institutions has been extremely rewarding," said Tom O'Donnell, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) New York region.  "No parent should be allowed to shirk court-ordered child support payments.  We applaud the work of the County task force that brought these fugitives to justice."</p>
<p>Between January 1 and June 13, 2013, 42 former fugitives owing more than $1.4 million in child support were captured.  All those arrested had at least one court warrant or commitment order, and many were also wanted under criminal contempt charges. </p>
<p>Included in the roundup was Carlos Acevedo, captured in Kissimmee, Florida, who owed $234,900 in support for two children living in Orange County. </p>
<p>Additionally, as of mid-June 2013, 77 Orange County child support fugitives owing more than $3 million were still being sought by law enforcement authorities.     </p>
<p>The OC Deadbeat Taskforce is a joint initiative between OIG, the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the Orange County Support Collection Unit, the District Attorney's Office, and the New York Department of Motor Vehicles.  </p>
<p>Between creation of the Taskforce in October 2011 and mid-June 2013, 127 deadbeat parents had been arrested and charged with 170 misdemeanor criminal contempt charges and 65 counts of misdemeanor nonsupport of a child.  These criminals owed more than a total of $2,500,000 in child support.  </p>
