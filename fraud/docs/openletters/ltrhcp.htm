<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AN OPEN LETTER TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS</H3>
<P>This is an invitation to the nation's health care providers to join me in a 
  national campaign to eliminate fraud and abuse from Medicare, Medicaid and the 
  more than 200 other Federal health and human development programs that serve 
  some of our most vulnerable citizens. </P>
<P>As most of you are aware, the Congress greatly increased the resources and 
  authorities of my office to combat health care fraud, and an intensified crackdown 
  is being pursued with the full support of the Administration. We are bolstering 
  our investigative and audit staffs, formulating new anti-fraud strategies, and 
  strengthening our collaboration with the Health Care Financing Administration, 
  the Department of Justice, and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
  offices. As Inspector General, I am committed to vigorously pursue civil and 
  criminal action against those who defraud this nation's health care programs.</P>
<P>These additional resources and broadened alliances will unquestionably enhance 
  our effectiveness in fighting fraud and abuse, but the Federal Government alone 
  cannot solve this problem. We need the involvement of you and your fellow health 
  care providers. Through cooperative efforts we can best ensure the success of 
  initiatives to identify and penalize the relatively few dishonest providers 
  whose fraudulent activities are eroding the solvency of the Federal health programs 
  and undermining public confidence in the health care industry.</P>
<P>As an example of how we can work together, the staff of my Office of Enforcement 
  and Compliance has been meeting with representatives of several provider groups 
  preparatory to drafting model compliance programs for health care providers. 
  To date, we have established general guidelines that describe seven elements 
  fundamental to an effective program of provider compliance with the rules governing 
  participation in the Government's health care programs. Using these building 
  blocks, we are eager to continue this collaboration to expeditiously produce 
  sector-specific compliance programs for each of the health care provider components 
  doing business with the Government. Work is now nearing completion on the <A HREF="../complianceguidance/cpcl.html">compliance 
  model for clinical laboratories</A>. It will be released this month and other 
  model programs are expected to be issued soon thereafter. Copies of the programs 
  will be made available through your professional association, published in the 
  Federal Register, and posted on the Internet as they are completed. For those 
  of you who have access to the Internet, visit our <A HREF="http://oig.hhs.gov">web 
  site.</A></P>
<P>While compliance programs are not a novel idea, they are becoming increasingly 
  popular as affirmative steps toward promoting a high level of ethical and lawful 
  corporate conduct. Numerous providers have expressed interest in better protecting 
  their operations from fraud through the adoption of compliance programs. Many 
  companies already have a program or are in the process of developing one either 
  in-house or with the assistance of outside consultants. When fraud is discovered, 
  both the Department of Justice and my office look at the entity to see if reasonable 
  efforts have been made by management to avoid and detect any misbehavior that 
  occurs within their operations. We use this analysis to determine the level 
  of sanctions, penalties and exclusions that will be imposed upon the provider. 
  To my knowledge, this is the first time the Government is revealing the elements 
  upon which we base those judgments.</P>
<P>In closing, I want to emphasize that my staff and I are committed to creating 
  an atmosphere that encourages voluntary compliance and self-disclosure by health 
  care providers. We are providing information which will help you protect yourselves 
  against unscrupulous people. We have the opportunity to work together to rid 
  the health care system of this insidious threat.</P>
