  <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">An 
    Open Letter to Health Care Providers</font></b></font></p>
  <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">November 
    20, 2001 </font> </p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> In the three 
    months since I was sworn in as Inspector General of the Department of Health 
    and Human Services (HHS), I have seen firsthand the importance of the work 
    done by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in ensuring the integrity of 
    our Federal health care programs. As the HHS Inspector General, I have become 
    aware of ways in which existing OIG policies can be modified to better serve 
    both providers and those charged with protecting the Federal health care programs. 
    For these reasons, I am pleased to announce modifications to OIG policies 
    and practices that are responsive to concerns that we have heard from the 
    provider and enforcement community regarding the civil settlement process.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In an effort 
    to improve the corporate integrity agreement and voluntary compliance initiatives, 
    our office has been engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the provider community. 
    For example, we recently completed a survey of providers and held a roundtable 
    discussion with compliance officers from providers operating under corporate 
    integrity agreements. With the help of the provider community, the OIG has 
    been working to promote the adoption of voluntary compliance programs, including 
    issuing compliance program guidances, special fraud alerts, and advisory opinions. 
    The OIG will continue to be a leader in promoting voluntary compliance. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As a result 
    of the OIG's outreach efforts, we recognize the provider community's interest 
    in streamlining the civil recoveries process. The OIG and the Department of 
    Justice will continue to seek to resolve a provider's permissive exclusion 
    liability concurrently with its False Claim Act liability. However, we recognize 
    there may be a limited number of cases where it would be appropriate to resolve 
    a provider's permissive exclusion liability separately or subsequent to resolution 
    of the False Claims Act case. We also recognize that in certain cases it may 
    be appropriate to release the OIG's administrative exclusion authorities without 
    a corporate integrity agreement. I have directed my staff to consider the 
    following criteria when determining whether to require a corporate integrity 
    agreement, and, if so, the substance of that agreement: (1) whether the provider 
    self-disclosed the alleged misconduct; (2) the monetary damage to the Federal 
    health care programs; (3) whether the case involves successor liability; (4) 
    whether the provider is still participating in the Federal health care programs 
    or in the line of business that gave rise to the fraudulent conduct; (5) whether 
    the alleged conduct is capable of repetition; (6) the age of the conduct; 
    (7) whether the provider has an effective compliance program and would agree 
    to limited compliance or integrity measures and would annually certify such 
    compliance to the OIG; and (8) other circumstances, as appropriate. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Through our 
    communications with providers, we have also become aware of and are concerned 
    about the financial impact of corporate integrity agreements on providers. 
    To address this concern, the OIG is modifying the provisions of our corporate 
    integrity agreements that address billing reviews and the use of independent 
    review organizations to reduce their financial impact, without weakening the 
    integrity of a provider's compliance program. Specifically, the corporate 
    integrity agreement billing review requirements will, in the future, require 
    the use of a full statistically valid random sample only in instances where 
    the initial claims review (which we will call a discovery sample) identifies 
    an unacceptably high error rate.<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a> This modification, 
    once finalized, will be incorporated into future corporate integrity agreements, 
    and, where appropriate, will be made available to providers currently operating 
    under a corporate integrity agreement. We will also be exploring ways to increase 
    reliance on providers' internal audit capabilities, and offer additional flexibility 
    in other corporate integrity agreement requirements, such as employee training. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The OIG will 
    be reviewing each provider's corporate integrity agreement to determine whether 
    it is appropriate to incorporate the new claims review procedures into the 
    provider's existing corporate integrity agreement. Our office will contact 
    providers regarding amendments to existing corporate integrity agreements. 
    A further explanation of this amendment process is more fully set forth in 
    a series of frequently asked questions, which will be posted on the OIG's 
    website at <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov">http://oig.hhs.gov</a> 
    or from the OIG's Public Affairs office at 202/619-1343. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In conclusion, 
    I think you will see many positive changes in the way the OIG approaches its 
    civil enforcement initiatives and corporate integrity agreements. We will 
    continue to balance our enforcement initiatives with provider outreach and 
    education in order to ensure the integrity of our Federal health care programs.
