<hr>

<p>February 2000 </p>

<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) was established at the Department of Health and
Human Services by Congress in 1976 to identify and eliminate fraud, abuse and waste in the
Department's programs and to promote efficiency and economy in departmental operations.
The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
To reduce fraud and abuse in the Federal health care programs, including Medicare and
Medicaid, the OIG actively investigates fraudulent schemes that are used to obtain money
from these programs and, when appropriate, issues Special Fraud Alerts that identify
practices in the health care industry that are particularly vulnerable to abuse. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
This Special Fraud Alert focuses on the rental of space in physicians' offices by persons
or entities that provide health care items or services (suppliers)<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
to patients that are referred either directly or indirectly by their physician-landlords.
In this Special Fraud Alert, we describe some of the potentially illegal practices the OIG
has identified in such rental relationships.<br wp="br2">
</p>

<hr size="1">
<p>

<strong>Questionable Rental Arrangements For Space in Physician Offices</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
A number of suppliers that provide health care items or services rent space in the offices
of physicians or other practitioners. Typically, most of the items or services provided in
the rented space are for patients, referred or sent, either directly or indirectly, to the
supplier by the physician-landlord. In particular, we are aware of rental arrangements
between physician-landlords and: 

<ul>
  <li>comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORFs) that provide physical and
    occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services in physicians' and other
    practitioners' offices;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>mobile diagnostic equipment suppliers that perform diagnostic related tests in
    physicians' offices; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS)
    that set up &quot;consignment closets&quot; for their supplies in physicians' offices. </li>
</ul>

<p>The OIG is concerned that in such arrangements, the rental payments may be disguised
kickbacks to the physician-landlords to induce referrals. We have received numerous
credible reports that in many cases, suppliers, whose businesses depend on physicians'
referrals, offer and pay &quot;rents&quot; -- either voluntarily or in response to
physicians' requests -- that are either unnecessary or in excess of the fair market value
for the space to access the physicians' potential referrals.<br>
&nbsp;</p><strong>

<hr size="1">

</strong><p><strong>The Anti-Kickback Law Prohibits Any Payments to Induce Referrals</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Kickbacks can distort medical decision-making, cause overutilization, increase costs and
result in unfair competition by freezing out competitors who are unwilling to pay
kickbacks. Kickbacks can also adversely affect the quality of patient care by encouraging
physicians to order services or recommend supplies based on profit rather than the
patients' best medical interests. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) prohibits knowingly and willfully
soliciting, receiving, offering or paying anything of value to induce referrals of items
or services payable by a Federal health care program. Both parties to an impermissible
kickback transaction are liable. Violation of the statute constitutes a felony punishable
by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The OIG may also
initiate administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs
or to impose civil money penalties for fraud, kickbacks and other prohibited activities
under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)<br>

<hr size="1">

</strong><p><strong>Suspect Rental Arrangements For Space in Physician Offices</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The questionable features of suspect rental arrangements for space in physicians' offices
may be reflected in three areas: 

<ul>
  <li>the appropriateness of rental agreements;</li>
  <li>the rental amounts; and</li>
  <li>time and space considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below, we examine these suspect areas, which separately or together may result in an
arrangement that violates the anti-kickback statute, in order to help identify
questionable rental arrangements between physicians and the suppliers to which they refer
patients. This list is not exhaustive, but rather gives examples of indicators of
potentially unlawful activity. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>Appropriateness of Rental Agreements.</strong> The threshold inquiry when
examining rental payments is whether payment for rent is appropriate at all. Payments of
&quot;rent&quot; for space that traditionally has been provided for free or for a nominal
charge as an accommodation between the parties for the benefit of the physicians'
patients, such as consignment closets for DMEPOS, may be disguised kickbacks. In general,
payments for rent of consignment closets in physicians' offices are suspect.<a
href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>Rental Amounts.</strong> Rental amounts should be at fair market value, be fixed
in advance and not take into account, directly or indirectly, the volume or value of
referrals or other business generated between the parties. Fair market value rental
payments should not exceed the amount paid for comparable property. Moreover, where a
physician rents space, the rate paid by the supplier should not exceed the rate paid by
the physicians in the primary lease for their office space, except in rare circumstances.
Examples of suspect arrangements include: 

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts in excess of amounts paid for comparable property rented in arms-length
    transactions between persons not in a position to refer business; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts for subleases that exceed the rental amounts per square foot in the
    primary lease; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts that are subject to modification more often than annually; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts that vary with the number of patients or referrals;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental arrangements that set a fixed rental fee per hour, but do not fix the number of
    hours or the schedule of usage in advance (i.e., &quot;as needed&quot; arrangements);</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts that are only paid if there are a certain number of Federal health care
    program beneficiaries referred each month; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts that are conditioned upon the supplier's receipt of payments from a
    Federal health care program.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time and Space Considerations. </strong>Suppliers should only rent premises of
a size and for a time that is reasonable and necessary for a commercially reasonable
business purpose of the supplier. Rental of space that is in excess of suppliers' needs
creates a presumption that the payments may be a pretext for giving money to physicians
for their referrals. Examples of suspect arrangements include: 

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts for space that is unnecessary or not used. For instance, a CORF requires
    one examination room and rents physician office space one afternoon a week when the
    physician is not in the office. The CORF calculates its rental payment on the square
    footage for the entire office, since it is the only occupant during that time, even though
    the CORF only needs one examination room;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>rental amounts for time when the rented space is not in use by the supplier. For
    example, an ultrasound supplier has enough business to support the use of one examination
    room for four hours each week, but rents the space for an amount equivalent to eight hours
    per week;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>non-exclusive occupancy of the rented portion of space. For example, a physical
    therapist does not rent space in a physician's office, but rather moves from examination
    room to examination room treating patients after they have been seen by the physician.
    Since no particular space is rented, we will closely scrutinize the proration of time and
    space used to calculate the therapist's &quot;rent&quot;. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, rental amount calculations should prorate rent based on the amount of
space and duration of time the premises are used. The basis for any proration should be
documented and updated as necessary. Depending on the circumstances, the supplier's rent
can consist of three components: (1) exclusive office space; (2) interior office common
space; and (3) building common space. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
1. <u>Apportionment of exclusive office space</u> - The supplier's rent should be
calculated based on the ratio of the time the space is in use by the supplier to the total
amount of time the physician's office is in use. In addition, the rent should be
calculated based on the ratio of the amount of space that is used exclusively by the
supplier to the total amount of space in the physician's office. For example, where a
supplier rents an examination room for four hours one afternoon per week in a physician's
office that has four examination rooms of equal size and is open eight hours a day, five
days per week, the supplier's prorated annual rent would be calculated as follows: <br

<p>2. <u>Apportionment of interior office common space</u> - When permitted by applicable
regulations, rental payments may also cover the interior office common space in
physicians' offices that are shared by the physicians and any subtenants, such as waiting
rooms. If suppliers use such common areas for their patients, it may be appropriate for
the suppliers to pay a prorated portion of the charge for such space. The charge for the
common space must be apportioned among <u>all</u> physicians and subtenants that use the
interior office common space based on the amount of non-common space they occupy and the
duration of such occupation. Payment for the use of office common space should not exceed
the supplier's pro rata share of the charge for such space based upon the ratio of the
space used exclusively by the supplier to the total amount of space (other than common
space) occupied by all persons using such common space. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
3. <u>Apportionment of building common space</u> - Where the physician pays a separate
charge for areas of a building that are shared by all tenants, such as building lobbies,
it may be appropriate for the supplier to pay a prorated portion of such charge. As with
interior office common space, the cost of the building common space must be apportioned
among <u>all</u> physicians and subtenants based on the amount of non-common space they
occupy and the duration of such occupation.&nbsp; For instance, in the example in number
one above, the supplier's share of the additional levy for building common space could not
be split 50/50. <br wp="br1">
</p><strong>

<hr size="1">

</strong><p><strong>The Space Rental Safe Harbor Can Protect Legitimate Arrangements</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
We strongly recommend that parties to rental agreements between physicians and suppliers
to whom the physicians refer or for which physicians otherwise generate business make
every effort to comply with the space rental safe harbor to the anti-kickback statute.
(See 42 CFR 1001.952(b), as amended by 64 FR 63518 (November 19, 1999)). When an
arrangement meets all of the criteria of a safe harbor, the arrangement is immune from
prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. The following are the safe harbor criteria,
all of which must be met: 

<ul>
  <li>The agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The agreement covers all of the premises rented by the parties for the term of the
    agreement and specifies the premises covered by the agreement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If the agreement is intended to provide the lessee with access to the premises for
    periodic intervals of time rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the rental
    agreement, the rental agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their
    precise length, and the exact rent for such intervals.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The term of the rental agreement is for not less than one year.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in
    arms-length transactions, and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the
    volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties for
    which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care
    program.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The aggregate space rented does not exceed that which is reasonably necessary to
    accomplish the commercially reasonable business purpose of the rental.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrangements for office equipment or personal services of physicians' office staff can
also be structured to comply with the equipment rental safe harbor and personal services
and management contracts safe harbor. (See 42 CFR 1001.952(c) and (d), as amended by 64 FR
63518 (November 19, 1999)). Specific equipment used should be identified and documented
and payment limited to the prorated portion of its use. Similarly, any services provided
should be documented and payment should be limited to the time actually spent performing
such services. <br wp="br1">
