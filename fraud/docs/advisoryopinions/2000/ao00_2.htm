<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 00-02</strong> </p>
<p>Dear [name redacted]: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion about a 
  proposed cost- savings program pursuant to which [name of hospital redacted] 
  (the &quot;Hospital&quot;) would reward its non-physician employees for submitting 
  cost-savings suggestions that the Hospital elects to implement (the &quot;Proposed 
  Arrangement&quot;). Specifically, the question raised by your request is whether 
  the Proposed Arrangement would constitute grounds for sanctions under the civil 
  monetary penalty for financial incentives to reduce or limit items or services, 
  section 1128A(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), or under 
  the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, in the circumstances 
  presented. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement, 
  as described and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions: 
  (i) would not constitute a prohibited inducement to reduce or limit items or 
  services under section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act, and (ii) could potentially generate 
  prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent 
  to induce referrals were present, but that the OIG will not subject the Hospital 
  to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) 
  or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the establishment of the Proposed 
  Arrangement itself; provided, however, that our conclusion does not apply to 
  specific payments made by the Hospital for specific suggestions. </p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Hospital, the 
  requestor of this opinion, and is further qualified as set out in Part V below 
  and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008.<br>
</p>
<p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b> </p>
<p>The Hospital, a State X not-for-profit corporation, operates an acute care 
  hospital that has a high percentage of Medicare and Medicaid patients. The Hospital 
  would like to implement an employee cost-savings program. Participation in the 
  program will be limited to non-physician employees of the Hospital,<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  although some of the participating employees may be in a position to make referrals 
  for, or arrange for the referral or provision of, items or services reimbursable 
  by Federal health care programs. </p>
<p>Under the Proposed Arrangement, non-physician employees will be permitted to 
  submit written cost-savings suggestions to the Human Resource Department of 
  the Hospital. If the Hospital determines that a suggestion has merit and is 
  feasible, it will pay the employee a percentage of the cost savings generated 
  by the suggestion. For suggestions resulting in quantifiable and measurable 
  financial savings, the Hospital will pay the employee an amount equal to [Y] 
  percent of the cost savings derived during the first year the suggestion is 
  implemented. For cost-savings suggestions that cannot be measured or quantified, 
  the Hospital will estimate its savings and pay the employee an amount based 
  upon a predetermined, sliding scale, subject to a maximum reward of [amount 
  redacted].<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> </p>
<p>The Hospital has certified that: 
<ul>
  <li>no payments will be made directly or indirectly to physicians under the 
    Proposed Arrangement;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the Proposed Arrangement will not reward or implement suggestions that would 
    reduce or limit health care services provided to its patients or impair the 
    quality of care delivered to its patients;<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>the Proposed Arrangement will not reward suggestions that identify specific 
    vendors, directly or indirectly; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>the Proposed Arrangement will not reward or implement suggestions that shift 
    costs to any Federal health care program.</li>
</ul>
<strong> 
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 1128A(b)(1) OF THE ACT</p>
</strong> 
<p>Our first inquiry is whether the Proposed Arrangement would violate section 
  1128A(b)(1) of the Act, which prohibits a hospital from making a payment, directly 
  or indirectly, to induce a physician to reduce or limit services to Federal 
  health care beneficiaries under the physician's direct care. A hospital that 
  makes, and any physician who accepts, such payments is subject to civil money 
  penalties of up to $2,000 for each patient covered by the improper payments. 
  <u>See</u> sections 1128A(b)(1) &amp; (2) of the Act. </p>
<p>Section 1128A(b)(1) only applies to arrangements between hospitals and physicians. 
  Since physicians are prohibited from participating, directly or indirectly, 
  in the Proposed Arrangement, the Proposed Arrangement does not implicate section 
  1128A(b)(1) of the Act. </p>
<p><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE</strong> </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law</strong> </p>
<p>A further question arises as to whether the Proposed Arrangement would violate 
  the anti-kickback statute. The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense 
  knowingly and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration 
  to induce referrals of items or services reimbursable by any Federal health 
  care program. <u>See</u> section 1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute 
  provides that: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50; margin-right: 50">Whoever knowingly and willfully offers 
  or pays [or solicits or receives] any remuneration (including any kickback, 
  bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in 
  kind to any person to induce such person -- to refer an individual to a person 
  for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for 
  which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, 
  or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, 
  or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made 
  in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of 
  a felony. </p>
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; 
  transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or 
  indirectly, covertly or overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. The Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) 
  may also initiate administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal 
  and State health care programs or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, 
  kickbacks, and other prohibited activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute excepts from its reach &quot;any amount paid by an 
  employer to an employee (who has a <em>bona fide</em> employment relationship 
  with such employer) for employment in the provision of covered items or services.&quot; 
  Section 1128B(b)(3)(B) of the Act. The OIG safe harbor regulations provide that 
  the term &quot;remuneration&quot;, as used in the anti-kickback statute, does 
  not include: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50; margin-right: 50">[A]ny amount paid by an employer 
  to an employee, who has a <em>bona fide </em>employment relationship with the 
  employer, for employment in the furnishing of any item or service for which 
  payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
  program. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the term <em>employee</em> 
  has the same meaning as it does for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2). </p>
<p>42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i). </p>
<p>Whether an individual is a<em> bona fide</em> employee for purposes of the 
  employee exception to the anti-kickback statute is a matter that is outside 
  the scope of the advisory opinion process. <u>See</u> section 1128D(b)(3)(B) 
  of the Act. Thus, for purposes of rendering this advisory opinion, we rely on 
  the Hospital's certification that individuals who will receive payments under 
  the Proposed Arrangement are <em>bona fide</em> employees in accordance with 
  the Internal Revenue Service's (&quot;IRS's&quot;) definition of the term set 
  forth at 26 U.S.C. § 3121(d)(2) and IRS interpretations of that provision as 
  codified in its regulations and other interpretive sources. If the individuals 
  are not <em>bona fide</em> employees, this opinion is without force and effect. 
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>Based upon the facts presented, we believe that most of the suggestions and 
  payments that would be made pursuant to the Proposed Arrangement are unlikely 
  to implicate the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)&nbsp; </sup></a><em>First</em>, 
  even if a proposed suggestion involves the purchase or use of a particular item 
  or service that is ultimately reimbursable in whole or in part, directly or 
  indirectly, by a Federal health care program, in most cases, the non-physician 
  employee who would receive the payment under the Proposed Arrangement would 
  not have the decision-making authority necessary to implement the suggestion. 
  <em>Second,</em> the Proposed Arrangement will not reward suggestions that specify, 
  directly or indirectly, a particular vendor. Therefore, although some non-physician 
  employees could be in a position to make referrals for, or recommend, items 
  or services within the meaning of the statute, the Proposed Arrangement does 
  not create an inducement for such non-physician employees to steer patients 
  to one provider over another. <em>Third</em>, the risk that a proposed suggestion 
  could result in increased costs for, or overutilization of items or services 
  reimbursable by, Federal health care programs is minimized because the Proposed 
  Arrangement (a) will only reward suggestions that increase efficiency or reduce 
  costs, and (b) will not reward or implement suggestions that shift costs to 
  any Federal health care program. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding, we are not in a position to pre-approve every possible payment 
  under the Proposed Arrangement. We do not know the amount of the potential payment, 
  the person to whom the payment will be made, or the action or activity that 
  will be proposed. Simply put, a blanket determination as to the propriety of 
  all payments that might be made under the Proposed Arrangement is hypothetical 
  and not a proper subject for an advisory opinion. See, 42 C.F.R. § 1008.15(b). 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we conclude that, although some payments that would be made under 
  the Proposed Arrangement might implicate the anti-kickback statute if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, the OIG will not subject the Hospital 
  to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) 
  or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the establishment of the Proposed 
  Arrangement itself. We caution, however, that our conclusion applies only to 
  the establishment of the Proposed Arrangement, not to specific payments for 
  specific suggestions. </p>
<p><strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>Based on the facts of the Proposed Arrangement (as described and certified 
  in the request letter and supplemental submissions), we conclude that the Proposed 
  Arrangement: (i) would not violate section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act, which prohibits 
  financial incentives to reduce or limit items or services, and (ii) could potentially 
  generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, but that the OIG will not subject the 
  Hospital to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 
  1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the establishment of 
  the Proposed Arrangement itself; provided, however, that our conclusion does 
  not apply to specific payments made by the Hospital for specific suggestions.
