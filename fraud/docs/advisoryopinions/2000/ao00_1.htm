  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  a consulting firm's contractual payment arrangements for the performance of 
  auditing services to identify hospital undercharges and overcharges associated 
  with private payors (the "Arrangement"). Specifically, you have inquired whether 
  the Arrangement constitutes grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, 
  section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"). <br>
  <br>
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the totality of the facts present in the Arrangement, as described 
  and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions, the Office 
  of Inspector General ("OIG") will not subject Company A, the requestor of this 
  opinion, to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under sections 
  1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement. <br>
  <br>
  This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Company A and is 
  further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  Company A is a consulting organization that enters into contracts with hospitals 
  to audit hospital bills for undercharges (hospitals claiming too little) and 
  overcharges (hospitals claiming too much) to private insurers paying on a charge 
  basis.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Company A audits only cases in the 
  following three hospital service areas: labor and delivery, endoscopies (gastrointestinal), 
  and surgeries.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Company A does not audit or 
  review any charges for services provided by ancillary departments (e.g., lab 
  tests and x-rays). <br>
  <br>
  Company A provides services in three phases: (i) Company A audits hospital records 
  for undercharges and overcharges on bills issued during the twelve-month period 
  before the effective date of the contract between Company A and the hospital 
  and on bills issued during the audit, and works with payors to reconcile incorrect 
  bills ("Phase I"); (ii) Company A holds a post-audit session during which it 
  presents the Phase I audit report findings to hospital nursing directors of 
  the service areas covered by the audit to prevent undercharges and overcharges 
  in the future ("Phase II"); and (iii) Company A conducts a six-month follow-up 
  audit to monitor hospital improvement using the same procedures applied in Phase 
  I ("Phase III"). <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals compensate Company A by paying Company A [x]% of the amount that the 
  hospitals recover through Phase I. Company A audits only those items or services 
  billed on a charge-basis. Company A does not audit amounts paid on the basis 
  of diagnosis or procedure related groups or codes. 
<p>Company A does not audit bills reimbursed by the Federal or State health care 
  programs, whether as primary or secondary payors. The Arrangement &#173; including 
  Phases II and III &#173; does not involve any Federal or State health care program 
  business, directly or indirectly. Company A has instituted the following procedure 
  for excluding Federal and State health care program business. Company A first 
  eliminates any bills for patients who are 65 years of age or older. For the 
  remaining hospital bills, Company A identifies a patient's primary and secondary 
  insurers from the UB-92 form (which is the same as the HCFA-1450 form, also 
  used by other Federal and State health care programs). The Federal and State 
  health care programs will not pay a claim without a designation on the UB-92 
  form stating that they are primary or secondary payors. If the UB-92 form reflects 
  that a Federal or State health care program (including CHAMPUS and the Title 
  XXI children's health insurance program) is a primary or secondary payor, Company 
  A will not review that patient's charges. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: <br>
  <br>
  Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] any 
  remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. <br>
  <br>
  The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose 
  of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services or to induce 
  further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); 
  <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 
  474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony punishable 
  by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. Conviction 
  will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, including 
  Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  As a threshold matter, we recognize that the Arrangement only applies to non-Federal 
  health care program billing practices and would appear not to implicate the 
  anti-kickback statute. The mere "carve-out" of Federal health care program billing, 
  however, does not end our inquiry, since such arrangements could have a "spillover" 
  effect on billing or coding for Federal health care program items or services. 
  Where such effect occurs and is intended by one or both parties, the statute 
  may be implicated. <br>
  <br>
  In this case, the Arrangement poses a limited risk of fraud or abuse under the 
  anti-kickback statute. First, Company A has certified that the Arrangement does 
  not involve Federal health care program business, directly or indirectly. Second, 
  the principal activity under the Arrangement is a one-time, wholly retrospective 
  billing audit. Such audits raise few questions under the anti-kickback statute 
  because where items or services have been entirely ordered, provided, and claimed 
  prior to the audit, there is little risk that the audit will involve an improper 
  referral under the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  Third, the prospective portions of the Arrangement, Phases II and III, are limited 
  in nature and present few, if any, opportunities for spillover effects on Federal 
  health care program billing or coding.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
<p>Accordingly, based on the totality of the facts present in the Arrangement, 
  we conclude there is a minimal risk that the Arrangement will have an adverse 
  effect on Federal health care program business. <u></u> <br>
  <br>
  For the above reasons, including, without limitation, Company A's representation 
  that the Arrangement will not involve Federal health care program business in 
  any respect, we will not subject Company A to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute in connection with the Arrangement. No opinion is herein expressed or 
  implied regarding the liability of any party under the False Claims Act or other 
  legal authorities for any improper billing, claims submission, cost reporting, 
  or related conduct directly or indirectly related to the Arrangement. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the totality of the facts present in the Arrangement as described and 
  certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions, the OIG will not 
  subject Company A to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under 
  sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIMITATIONS</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  The limitations applicable to this opinion include the following: 
<ul>
  <li> This advisory opinion is issued only to Company A, the requestor of this 
    opinion. This advisory opinion has no application to, and cannot be relied 
    upon by, any other individual or entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence in any matter 
    involving an entity or individual that is not a requestor to this opinion. 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above in the first paragraph of this opinion. No opinion is herein expressed 
    or implied with respect to the application of any other Federal, state, or 
    local statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, or other law that may be applicable 
    to the Arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> No opinion is expressed herein regarding the liability of any party under 
    the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, 
    claims submission, cost reporting, or related conduct. </li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. <br>
  <br>
  The OIG will not proceed against the requestor with respect to any action that 
  is part of the Arrangement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion 
  as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and accurately 
  presented, and the Arrangement in practice comports with the information provided. 
  The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions and issues raised in 
  this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, rescind, modify, 
  or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion is modified 
  or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the requestor with respect to 
  any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, where all 
  of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented, and 
  where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely, and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>Company A also offers managed care payment review services 
  to hospitals. Such services are outside the scope of this advisory opinion. 
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>In its advisory opinion request and supplemental submissions, 
  Company A specified in detail its procedures for identifying undercharges and 
  overcharges contained in hospital bills. For purposes of this advisory opinion, 
  it is sufficient to note that the auditors search for errors in a hospital's 
  charging and billing by comparing the patients' medical records to their billing 
  records. In performing its audits, Company A uses the charge protocols that 
  existed at the time the hospital originally determined the charges for a given 
  procedure. 
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions 
  related to the anti-kickback implications of the Arrangement are based on violations 
  of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion 
  is the same under both. 
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>We have identified a number of risk areas, including 
  false claims liability, with respect to the operation of third party billing 
  companies. <u>See</u> The Office of Inspector General's Compliance Program Guidance 
  for Third-Party Medical Billing Companies (Nov. 24, 1998), <u>reprinted in</u> 
  63 Fed. Reg. 70,138 (Dec. 18, 1998). Institutions and individuals are legally 
  responsible for the appropriateness of claims submitted by third party billing 
  companies to Federal or State health care programs on their behalf. 
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>Our determination not to impose sanctions in these circumstances 
  is attributable to the entirety of the facts of the Arrangement. In other circumstances, 
  prospective advice and training programs could implicate the anti-kickback statute, 
  False Claims Act, and other legal authorities. By way of example only, such 
  statutes may be violated if a hospital pays a consultant based on a percentage 
  of collections to train the hospital's coders to characterize services in ways 
  that may result in upcoding of the services being ordered. <p>
