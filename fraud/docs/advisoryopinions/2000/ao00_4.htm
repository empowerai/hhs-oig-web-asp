  <strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 00-4</strong> 
<p>Dear Dr. Gordon: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  a lifestyle modification program for individuals with chronic disease that uses 
  physicians to monitor and evaluate the program's participants (the "Proposed 
  Arrangement" or the "Program"). Specifically, you have inquired whether the 
  Proposed Arrangement constitutes grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"). 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement 
  would potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts as described and certified in your request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not 
  subject INTERxVENT<sup>USA</sup>, Inc., to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with 
  the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than INTERxVENT<sup>USA</sup>, 
  Inc., and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. 
  Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>INTERxVENT<sup>USA</sup>, Inc. ("INTERxVENT" or the "Requestor"), has created 
  the Program, a coordinated lifestyle and behavior modification program that 
  focuses on nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management<strong> 
  </strong>for individuals with, or at risk for, certain chronic diseases (the 
  "Participants"). Most Participants have, or are at risk for, cardiovascular 
  disease or stroke. In essence, the Proposed Arrangement is a preventive health 
  program for chronic disease patients. 
<p>The following aspects of the Program are described below: (i) the Program's 
  services; (ii) the Program's physician network; and (iii) payment for the Program's 
  services. 
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Program's Services</b></p>
<p>The core of the Program's services is an individualized "risk reduction" program. 
  INTERxVENT has created a computer program that will generate a set of "risk 
  reduction goals" and a "personal action plan" for each Participant, based on 
  guidelines set by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, 
  the U.S. Public Health Service Preventive Services Task Force, and other national 
  organizations. The INTERxVENT computer program uses information from questionnaires 
  that each Participant must complete on his or her medical history and health 
  habits, in addition to certain other data, such as the Participant's weight 
  and blood pressure. The Program reinforces the lifestyle changes specified in 
  the personal action plans by requiring the Participants' attendance at regular 
  meetings with non-physician health care professionals ("Mentors"), such as nurses, 
  physical therapists, exercise physiologists, and dietitians. Mentors counsel 
  the Participants on how to alter their nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle 
  habits, and thereby improve their health. 
<p>Using the risk reduction goals and the personal action plan as a guide, each 
  Participant visits a Mentor approximately twenty times during the first year 
  of enrollment in the Program. After the first year, the Participants visit their 
  Mentors approximately twelve times per year (once per month). During each visit, 
  the Mentor works with the Participant using various behavior modification techniques. 
  Participants are required to keep diet and exercise diaries that the Mentors 
  check during each visit. The Program uses a computerized system to manage and 
  track the Participants' compliance with the action plan. 
<p>Occasionally, where clinical intervention is indicated based on medical guidelines, 
  the Mentors may refer Participants to physicians to help the Participants meet 
  their risk reduction goals. A Participant may be referred to a physician to 
  consider testing (e.g., a blood test for cholesterol and triglyceride levels) 
  and drug therapy (e.g., prescribing cholesterol lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive 
  agents, oral hypoglycemic agents, hormone replacement therapy, etc.). Generally, 
  these referrals will be to the Participant's own personal physician. However, 
  if a Participant does not have a personal physician, the Participant may choose 
  a physician from a list of physicians in INTERxVENT's physician network ("Network 
  Physicians"), as described below. For Participants who would like INTERxVENT 
  to recommend a specific physician, one will be chosen from the list based on 
  geographic proximity, on a rotating basis. 
<p>An integral part of the Program is INTERxVENT's ongoing research study, in 
  which Participants are required to participate. An objective of the study is 
  to follow patients with, or at risk for, chronic disease treated in community-based 
  physician practices, tracking the effect of changes in nutrition, exercise, 
  and other lifestyle habits on their conditions. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Physician Network</b> 
<p>Participants may access the Program's services in one of three ways: (i) through 
  an institution (e.g., an employer or a managed care plan); (ii) through self-referral 
  to the Program; or (iii) through Network Physicians.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Relevant to this opinion are only the Program's aspects that involve the Network 
  Physicians. 
<p>Network Physicians are usually cardiologists, primary care physicians, and 
  internal medicine physicians to whom INTERxVENT has marketed the Program as 
  a low cost, high benefit behavior modification program that physicians can offer 
  to their patients with, or at risk for, chronic disease as an adjunct to their 
  medical care. In most cases, the Network Physicians will be referring their 
  own patients to participate in the Program, rather than receiving new referrals 
  from the Program. New referrals of patients from the Program will be rare because 
  under the Program, if a Participant needs a referral to a physician, Participants 
  are referred first to their personal physician. Thus, most of the referrals 
  from the Program to the Network Physicians will be their own patients returning 
  for check-ups or for possible testing or changes to their medication in accordance 
  with national medical guidelines. 
<p>The Network Physicians periodically will evaluate the Participants that they 
  refer to the Program. In most cases, the INTERxVENT Mentor will guide the Participants 
  through the questionnaires and will take the various measurements needed to 
  evaluate the Participants' progress and generate reports. However, the Network 
  Physicians will review and sign the action plans, risk reduction goals, and 
  progress reports that are generated, and will modify them as needed. The Program 
  will pay the physicians $[ ] for the initial evaluation report and $[ ] for 
  each subsequent re-evaluation report. 
<p>Each Network Physician will pay INTERxVENT a participation fee of $[ ] initially 
  and thereafter will pay a $[ ] annual fee. Occasionally, these fees may be discounted 
  or waived based on sponsorship of the physician or physician group by a JCAHO 
  accredited health system, the number of their patients who participate in the 
  program, and the number of patients who meet their goals. The fee will cover 
  the costs of Program materials, computer software, and free or discounted participation 
  in the Program for the Network Physician's employees (as described below). 
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment for the Program's 
  Services</b> 
<p>In general, a Participant pays out of pocket for the Program's services; however, 
  if the Participant is enrolled through an institution, such as an employer or 
  a managed care plan, then the institution may pay on the Participant's behalf. 
  In either situation, a key to the Program is keeping the costs of participation 
  low. 
<p>In general, Participants pay $[ ] per year to enroll in the Program, subject 
  to the following discounts. First, all employees of Network Physicians may attend 
  the Program's orientation session and initial evaluation session free of charge. 
  In addition, up to five of a Network Physician's employees may enroll in the 
  Program free of charge; any additional employees may participate in the Program 
  at a discounted rate of $[ ] per Participant per year. 
<p>Second, if the Participant enrolls in the Program through an institution, the 
  Program currently charges the institution at a rate of $X per Participant per 
  year, or $Y per identified high risk covered person per year. The $Y fee is 
  collected regardless of whether the Program is actually used. Such institutions 
  may include Medicare Plus Choice organizations, with which INTERxVENT may contract 
  to provide the Program's services to the plans' at risk chronic disease patient 
  population.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> At present, INTERxVENT does not 
  have any contracts with Medicare Plus Choice organizations.&nbsp; 
<p><b>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law</b> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: 
<p style="margin-left: 50"> Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or 
  solicits or receives] any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) 
  directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person 
  to induce such person -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing 
  or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may 
  be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, 
  lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any 
  good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in 
  part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of a felony. 
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis</b> 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement raises the following two issues under the anti-kickback 
  statute: (i) whether the Network Physicians will pay participation fees to INTERxVENT 
  in exchange for INTERxVENT's referrals of patients to the Network Physicians 
  for Federal health care program-covered services; and (ii) whether INTERxVENT 
  will pay the Network Physicians fees in exchange for the Network Physicians' 
  referrals of patients whose Program services may be paid for by the Federal 
  health care programs. 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement poses a minimal risk of fraud or abuse for the following 
  reasons: 
<ul>
  <li> The Network Physicians pay INTERxVENT's initial and annual participation 
    fee payments to offer their patients access to the Program and to offer their 
    employees the benefit of free or discounted Program services. The Network 
    Physicians only occasionally will receive referrals from INTERxVENT. Moreover, 
    when a Network Physician receives a referral, in most cases the referral will 
    be of a Participant who was originally the Network Physician's own patient. 
    The Network Physician would perform services on these patients that generally 
    would be performed at a regular check-up. A very small number of referrals 
    from INTERxVENT to the Network Physicians will be new patients.<br>
  </li>
  <li> The Program will not increase Federal health care program costs. The vast 
    majority of Participants will pay for the Program's services out of their 
    own pockets or will have employers who will pay for them. Although currently 
    INTERxVENT does not have any agreements negotiated with Medicare Plus Choice 
    organizations for coverage of the Participants' enrollment fees, in the future, 
    some Participants may have the Program's enrollment fees covered by their 
    Medicare Plus Choice plans. However, because the Federal health care programs 
    pay Medicare Plus Choice plans a capitated rate, a plan's decision to cover 
    enrollment fees will not increase Federal health care program costs.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the Program poses a minimal risk of fraud or abuse. Furthermore, 
  the Program potentially offers significant benefits to individuals with chronic 
  disease. The Program is designed to improve patient compliance with risk reduction 
  programs, thereby potentially improving their health and reducing Federal health 
  care program costs. In addition, the Program will enable INTERxVENT to conduct 
  independent research on the effect of preventive measures on patients whose 
  chronic diseases are being managed clinically in individual community-based 
  physician practices. 
<p>For these reasons, we would not impose sanctions on the Requestor arising under 
  the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act. 
<p><b>III. CONCLUSION</b> 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement 
  would potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts present in the Proposed Arrangement as described and 
  certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions, the OIG will not 
  subject the Requestor to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Arrangement.
