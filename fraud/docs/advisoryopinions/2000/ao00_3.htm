  Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 00-3</strong> </p>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  an arrangement to provide various services free of charge to patients with terminal 
  illnesses who have a prognosis of one year or less to live (the &quot;Program&quot;). 
  Specifically, you have inquired whether the Program constitutes grounds for 
  sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security 
  Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), or under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, which prohibits 
  the offering of inducements to beneficiaries in order to influence their selection 
  of a provider for Medicare or Medicaid covered services. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that: (i) the Program would 
  potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts as described and certified in your request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) 
  will not subject the Hospice of Martin &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., and the Hospice 
  Foundation of Martin &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., (collectively referred to as the 
  &quot;Hospice&quot;) to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Program; 
  and (ii) the OIG will not subject the Hospice to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act in connection with the Program as described and certified in your 
  request letter and supplemental submissions. </p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Hospice, and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
</p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parties</b></p>
<p>The Hospice Foundation of Martin &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., is a Florida nonprofit 
  organization that acts as the supporting foundation for the Hospice of Martin 
  &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides various &quot;end 
  of life&quot; services. The Hospice Foundation of Martin &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., 
  establishes and maintains programs to assist the Hospice of Martin &amp; St. 
  Lucie, Inc., in achieving its mission. For purposes of our analysis in this 
  advisory opinion, we will consider the Hospice Foundation of Martin &amp; St. 
  Lucie, Inc., and the Hospice of Martin &amp; St. Lucie, Inc., as a single entity 
  in light of their close relationship, collectively referred to as the &quot;Hospice&quot;. 
</p>
<p>The Hospice offers hospice services to patients and offers bereavement programs, 
  community-wide support programs, and educational programs to the patients' families, 
  friends, co-workers, caregivers, and the community-at-large. The Hospice's eligibility 
  requirements for hospice services are consistent with those for the Medicare 
  hospice benefit: patients must be diagnosed with a terminal illness and a prognosis 
  of no more than six months to live if the illness runs its normal course. The 
  Hospice provides hospice care to eligible patients, regardless of their ability 
  to pay; however, the hospice care services are funded largely through Medicare, 
  Medicaid, and private insurance. Donations are the primary source of funding 
  for the bereavement, community-wide support, and educational programs. The Hospice 
  has certified that its contracts with nursing homes to provide hospice services 
  to their patients contain provisions for payment that are consistent with fair 
  market value in arms-length transactions. </p>
<strong> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Program </p>
</strong> 
<p>The Program is a community service program sponsored by a non-profit hospice 
  that uses unpaid volunteers to provide assistance, companionship, and other 
  complimentary services (i.e., without charge) to the terminally ill who have 
  a prognosis of one year or less to live, if the illness runs its normal course.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Most of the patients receiving the services are not eligible for the Hospice's 
  hospice services (because they have a life expectancy of over six months) or, 
  although eligible, have elected to continue curative treatment. </p>
<p>The Program's services vary depending on whether the patient lives in his or 
  her private residence or in a nursing home. If a patient lives in his or her 
  private residence, the Hospice sends a &quot;home service volunteer,&quot; who 
  offers the following services: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship and visitation;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; transportation;<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)<br>
  </sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; assistance with writing and reading 
  correspondence;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; running errands;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp; food preparation; and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi)&nbsp; respite &quot;breaks&quot; for the family or caregiver. 
</p>
<p>If the patient lives in a nursing home, the Hospice sends a &quot;nursing home 
  volunteer&quot; who offers a more limited range of services. The nursing home 
  volunteer offers only the services listed in (i) through (iii) above. </p>
<p>Under the Program, the Hospice does not offer any services to nursing home 
  patients that duplicate services the nursing homes are obligated to provide, 
  such as food preparation and respite care or that are covered by the Florida 
  Medicaid nursing facility per diem.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Regardless 
  of the setting, complimentary services do not include any nursing services, 
  home health aide services, medical social work services, measuring and/or administering 
  of medications, or rendering of professional care or advice. </p>
<p>Once a patient begins receiving services under the Program, the Hospice informs 
  the patient of the various organizations in the community that provide continuing 
  care services, which may include home health care or hospice care (including 
  the Hospice). In addition, the Hospice will provide a similar list to the nursing 
  homes in which it offers the Program's services. </p>
<p>The Hospice has been operating the Program since August 1999. The costs of 
  employing a manager of the Program, training the volunteers, and other expenses 
  related to the Program are funded by the Hospice from charitable donations. 
  At present, the Hospice has seven patients enrolled under the Program, all of 
  whom are home-based. Although the Hospice currently does not have any nursing 
  home-based patients who receive services under the Program, the Hospice anticipates 
  that in the future some of the Program's patients will live in nursing homes. 
  The Hospice disseminates information about the Program by communicating not 
  only with nursing homes, but also with physicians, discharge planners, churches, 
  synagogues, and aging and disability advocacy groups. The Hospice provides the 
  Program services only to patients in the state of Florida. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F</b><strong>ederal 
  Health Care Program Reimbursement</strong></p>
<p>Medicare's hospice benefit provides palliative care to individuals who are 
  terminally ill. Palliative care focuses on pain control, symptom management, 
  and counseling for both the patient and family. In order to elect the hospice 
  benefit, a Medicare beneficiary must be entitled to Medicare Part A services 
  and certified as terminally ill, which is defined (for Medicare purposes) as 
  a medical prognosis of six months or less to live, if the illness runs its normal 
  course. A beneficiary who elects to enroll in a hospice program waives all his 
  or her rights to Medicare payments for curative care related to his or her terminal 
  illness during the period of election of hospice care. However, Medicare will 
  continue to pay for services furnished by the patient's non-hospice attending 
  physician and for the treatment of conditions unrelated to the terminal illness. 
</p>
<p>Because hospice services are typically provided to patients in their homes, 
  the routine home care hospice rate does not include any payment for room or 
  board. For services provided to patients in nursing homes, Medicare pays hospices 
  the Medicare routine home care rate, which is a fixed amount per day for the 
  services provided by the hospice, regardless of the volume or intensity of the 
  services provided. Accordingly, if the hospice patient resides in a nursing 
  home, the patient remains responsible for payment of the nursing home's room 
  and board charges. </p>
<p>If, however, a patient receiving Medicare hospice benefits in a nursing home 
  is also eligible for Medicaid, Medicaid will pay the hospice at least 95 percent 
  of the state's daily nursing home rate, and the hospice is then responsible 
  for paying the nursing home for the beneficiary's room and board. The specific 
  services included in the daily rate payment are determined by a state's Medicaid 
  program and may vary from state to state. In addition to the room and board 
  payment, a hospice may contract with the nursing home for the nursing home to 
  provide non-core hospice services (i.e., those services the hospice is not required 
  by law to provide itself) to its hospice patients. </p>
<strong> 
<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> </p>
</strong> 
<p>The provision of free services to potential hospice patients may implicate 
  two statutes: (i) the civil monetary penalty prohibiting the offer or transfer 
  of remuneration to beneficiaries as inducements to use a particular provider, 
  practitioner or supplier, section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act; and (ii) the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act. Moreover, the provision of these free 
  services to patients of nursing homes raises the possibility of illegal kickbacks 
  in the Program between the Hospice and the nursing homes. </p>
<strong> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law</p>
</strong> 
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act prohibits a person from offering or transferring 
  remuneration to a beneficiary that such person knows or should know is likely 
  to influence the beneficiary to order items or services from a particular provider, 
  practitioner, or supplier for which payment may be made by Medicare or a State 
  health care program. For purposes of section 1128A(a)(5), &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market 
  value. <u>See</u> section 1128A(i)(6) of the Act. </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50; margin-right: 50">Whoever knowingly and willfully offers 
  or pays [or solicits or receives] any remuneration (including any kickback, 
  bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in 
  kind to any person to induce such person -- to refer an individual to a person 
  for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for 
  which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, 
  or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, 
  or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made 
  in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of 
  a felony. </p>
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; 
  transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or 
  indirectly, covertly or overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>We have issued a special fraud alert detailing problematic arrangements between 
  nursing homes and hospices.&nbsp; <u>See</u> Special Fraud Alert, &quot;Fraud 
  and Abuse in Nursing Home Programs with Hospices,&quot; 63 Fed. Reg. 20415 (Apr. 
  24, 1998). Among the arrangements identified as suspect in the special fraud 
  alert were: a hospice's offer of free care to nursing home patients for whom 
  the nursing home is receiving Medicare payment under the skilled nursing facility 
  benefit, with the expectation that after the patient exhausts the skilled nursing 
  facility benefit, the patient will receive hospice services from that hospice; 
  and a hospice's payments to the nursing home for &quot;additional&quot; services 
  that the State's Medicaid program considers to be included in its room and board 
  payment to the hospice. <u>Id.</u> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis</b> 
</p>
<p>The Program raises three principal issues under the two statutes discussed 
  above: (i) whether the Hospice knows or should know that its provision of free 
  services to potential hospice patients will be likely to influence the patients' 
  choice of hospice provider; (ii) whether one purpose of the Hospice's provision 
  of complimentary services to the patients under the Program is to induce them 
  to use the Hospice's hospice services; and (iii) whether the provision of services 
  to the patients who live in nursing homes may be remuneration to the nursing 
  homes for permitting the Hospice access to their patients.</p>
<p>With respect to the first two issues, we think that at least some of the services 
  being provided may have value and constitute remuneration within the meaning 
  of both statutes. Moreover, we think it likely that the benefits are provided 
  at least in part to induce the patients to obtain hospice care from the Hospice 
  at the appropriate time. Notwithstanding, we would not subject the Program to 
  sanction under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act and the anti-kickback statute 
  for the following reasons in combination: 
<ul>
  <li>First, the services are provided by unpaid volunteers;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Second, the benefits of the Program are primarily intangible and psychic 
    in the sense that the services are designed to help the patients adjust to 
    their illnesses by helping them and their friends and families to cope with 
    the day to day burdens of life;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Third, the Program provides a substantial benefit to a vulnerable patient 
    group; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth, there are substantial barriers to a beneficiary's election of hospice 
    care, including the requirement that he or she renounce coverage for curative 
    medical treatment for the terminal condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, we would not subject the Hospice to sanction under 
  sections 1128A(a)(5), 1128(b)(7), or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with 
  the Program in the absence of other inculpatory activity. In particular, our 
  recognition that there are substantial barriers to a beneficiary's election 
  of hospice care does not mean that hospice providers can offer inducements to 
  patients to elect hospice. We mean only that in the particular circumstances 
  here, i.e., services of relatively small monetary value provided by unpaid volunteers, 
  the requirement that hospice patients forgo curative care for their underlying 
  terminal illnesses provides a safeguard against the overutilization often associated 
  with such inducements. </p>
<p>We have additional concerns, however, with the provision of these services 
  to patients in nursing homes. In particular, we are concerned that the services 
  provided by the Hospice could substitute for services the nursing home would 
  otherwise have to provide, thereby resulting in the Hospice providing free services 
  to the nursing home. As we stated in the special fraud alert, there is a substantial 
  overlap in hospice and nursing home services and the substitution of hospice 
  services for nursing home services may be disguised remuneration from the hospice 
  for access to the nursing home's patients. In this case, the complimentary services 
  provided pursuant to the Program have been carefully delineated and, pursuant 
  to the Hospice's certification, do not duplicate any nursing home services. 
  Moreover, the fact that the services are provided by unpaid volunteers, most 
  of whom are not health care professionals or workers, makes it unlikely that 
  the services being provided will substitute for services required to be provided 
  by the nursing homes. </p>
<p>We continue to have serious concerns regarding the provision of free or below 
  market value goods to actual or potential referral sources. Such practices may 
  constitute violations of the anti-kickback statute, depending on the circumstances. 
  However, with respect to this Program, where the free services (i) are provided 
  by unpaid volunteers, (ii) result in benefits that are primarily intangible 
  and psychic, and (iii) support a vulnerable patient population, we would not 
  impose sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute. Nothing in this opinion 
  should be taken to permit or protect any other relationships between the Hospice 
  and any nursing facilities. </p>
<p>For these reasons, we would not impose sanctions on the Hospice arising under 
  either the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b), or under section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act in connection with the Program. </p>
<strong> 
<p><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
</strong> 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude (i) that the Program would potentially 
  generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on the totality of 
  the facts present in the Program as described and certified in the request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, the OIG will not subject the Hospice to sanctions 
  for violations of the anti-kickback statute under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act in connection with the Program; and (ii) that the OIG will not subject 
  the Hospice to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection 
  with the Program as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental 
  submissions. <br>
  <br>
