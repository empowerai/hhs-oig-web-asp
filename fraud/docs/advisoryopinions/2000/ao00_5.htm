<p> <strong> Re: National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) Advisory Opinion No. 
  00-5</strong> 
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether waiving Medicare Part A and Part B copayment and deductible 
  obligations for participants in a clinical study sponsored by the Health Care 
  Financing Administration and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (the 
  "Proposed Arrangement") will subject you to sanction under section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), or under the anti-kickback statute, 
  section 1128B(b) of the Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary letters, is true and correct, and constitutes a 
  complete description of the material facts regarding the Proposed Arrangement. 
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that: (i) the Proposed Arrangement 
  would potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts as described and certified in your request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not 
  subject the individuals and entities listed on the attached Distribution List 
  (the "Requestors") to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Arrangement; and (ii) the OIG will not subject the Requestors to sanctions under 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement as 
  described and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  This advisory opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the individuals 
  and entities listed on the attached Distribution List and is further qualified 
  as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedural History</strong></p>
<p>This opinion reflects a second request for an advisory opinion in connection 
  with the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (the "NETT"), a clinical trial sponsored 
  by the Health Care Financing Administration ("HCFA") and the National Heart, 
  Lung, and Blood Institute ("NHLBI") of the National Institutes of Health. The 
  first request was filed in 1997 by a number of clinics and physicians participating 
  in the NETT ("NETT Request I"). NETT Request I sought an opinion about whether 
  the practice of waiving copayments and deductibles for items and services covered 
  by Medicare Part B and within the scope of the clinical protocol that governs 
  the NETT (the "NETT Protocol") would be subject to sanction under sections 1128A(a)(5) 
  and 1128B(b) of the Act. In response, the OIG issued OIG Advisory Opinion 98-6 
  on April 20, 1998. The opinion held that in the specific circumstances presented, 
  the OIG would not subject the requestors of NETT Request I to sanctions arising 
  under sections 1128A(a)(5) and 1128B(b) of the Act for their waivers of Part 
  B copayments and deductibles for services within the scope of the NETT Protocol. 
  As is the case with all OIG advisory opinions, Advisory Opinion 98-6 is binding 
  only on the NETT clinics and physicians that signed on as requestors. 
<p>The second NETT advisory opinion request ("NETT Request II") gives rise to 
  the present advisory opinion. NETT Request II was submitted by the NETT clinics 
  and physicians, some of whom were requestors of NETT Request I (the "Original 
  Requesting Parties"),<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and some of whom were 
  not (the "New Requesting Parties"). NETT Request II seeks (i) an opinion as 
  to the same conduct raised in NETT Request I for the New Requesting Parties 
  (i.e., waivers of Medicare Part B copayments and deductibles), and (ii) an opinion 
  for both the New Requesting Parties and the Original Requesting Parties regarding 
  waivers of Medicare Part A copayments and deductibles attributable to services 
  provided under the NETT Protocol. Thus, the core difference between NETT Request 
  II and NETT Request I is that NETT Request II deals with waivers of copayments 
  and deductibles for the NETT Protocol services covered by both Medicare Parts 
  A and B. The NETT seeks the expanded waiver authority in light of its continuing 
  difficulties in securing adequate participation in the NETT clinical study (as 
  further described below). 
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p><strong></strong>The Proposed Arrangement at issue in NETT Request II is substantially 
  the same as the program described in NETT Request I. Accordingly, the facts 
  as described in Advisory Opinion 98-6 are incorporated into this opinion by 
  reference. 
<p>As described in Advisory Opinion 98-6, the NETT is a multicenter, randomized 
  clinical trial to study the effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery ("LVRS") 
  to treat moderate to severe emphysema. The trial is a collaboration between 
  HCFA and the NHLBI. <strong> </strong>The NETT Protocol was independently peer 
  reviewed by a panel comprised of individuals with appropriate expertise in a 
  number of areas, including relevant areas of medicine and public health. HCFA 
  has agreed to pay for Medicare allowable patient care services, including LVRS, 
  covered by the NETT Protocol and hopes to use the trial's results to determine 
  if LVRS should be covered by Medicare as a reasonable and necessary treatment. 
<p>NHLBI has contracted with numerous clinical centers around the country to be 
  the NETT participating clinics that will provide services covered by the NETT 
  Protocol. The trial will be conducted over a fifty-four month period and will 
  involve 2,500 patients.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> The NETT patients, 
  who must meet the study's selection criteria, will be referred to the NETT contracting 
  centers by their private physicians. The NETT patients must be Medicare beneficiaries 
  or have other insurance to cover the cost of the NETT services. Eligible patients 
  will be asked to consent to: (i) enrollment in a pulmonary rehabilitation program; 
  and (ii) random assignment into one of two study groups, only one of which will 
  receive LVRS. 
<p>Although overall responsibility for medical management of the NETT patients 
  will remain with each patient's regular primary care physician, the NETT patients 
  will be evaluated by the NETT physicians to ensure that the NETT treatment standards 
  are met. Patients in the LVRS group will be managed pursuant to post-operative 
  care and complication management procedures described in the NETT Protocol. 
<p>All of the NETT patients will be seen at the NETT participating clinics for 
  follow-up visits, which are expected to last one to two days per visit, and 
  for data collection at six-month intervals for two years after randomization 
  and annually thereafter. In addition, the patients will be required to complete 
  questionnaires at home and will be contacted by telephone according to a schedule 
  set forth in the NETT Protocol. 
<p>Under sections 1813 and 1833 of the Act and implementing regulations, Medicare 
  beneficiaries are obligated to pay certain copayment and deductible amounts 
  for Medicare Part A and Part B covered services. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 42 U.S.C. 
  &#167;&#167; 1395e &amp; 1395<em>l</em>; 42 C.F.R. Parts 409 &amp; 410. The 
  Requestors seek to waive these copayments and deductibles for items and services 
  that are (i) within the scope of the NETT Protocol and (ii) covered under Medicare 
  Parts A and B, without regard to the patient's ability to pay. The following 
  Medicare Part A covered services would be subject to the waiver when provided 
  to the NETT patients within the scope of the NETT Protocol: (i) inpatient hospital 
  services; (ii) skilled nursing facility services; and (iii) long-term care and 
  rehabilitation hospital services. The Requestors have certified that they will 
  not claim the waived Part A and Part B copayment and deductible amounts as bad 
  debt on any Federal or state cost reports. Copayment and deductible waivers 
  for Part A and Part B services provided outside the scope of the NETT Protocol 
  are not included in the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>The Requestors assert that waiving copayment and deductible amounts for the 
  NETT patients will enhance the reliability of the study and the validity of 
  its results by promoting patient compliance with the NETT Protocol, including 
  patient cooperation in follow-up data collection efforts. As noted in footnote 
  1, the NETT has experienced unexpected difficulties in recruiting sufficient 
  eligible patients for the clinical trial. They anticipate that theaddition of 
  Part A copayment and deductible waivers within the limited scope of the NETT 
  Protocol may persuade more patients to enroll in the study. The Requestors are 
  also concerned that requiring payment of Part A and Part B copayments and deductibles 
  may cause an undue hardship on economically disadvantaged patients that would 
  undermine their participation in the NETT study and compromise its integrity. 
<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Law</u></strong> 
<p> The anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, makes it a criminal 
  offense knowingly and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration 
  to induce the referral of business covered by a Federal health care program. 
  Specifically, the statute provides that:&nbsp; 
<p> &quot;Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] 
  any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony.&quot; 
<p>Section 1128B(b) of the Act. In other words, the statute prohibits payments 
  made purposefully to induce referrals of business for which payment may be made 
  by a Federal health care program. The statute ascribes liability to both sides 
  of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. The statute has been interpreted 
  to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose of the remuneration is to 
  obtain money for the referral of services or to induce further referrals. <u>United 
  States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 
  760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). "Remuneration" 
  for purposes of the anti-kickback statute includes the transfer of any thing 
  of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>Violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a felony punishable by a 
  maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. Conviction 
  will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, including 
  Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from the Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>Section 
  231(h) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, provides for the imposition of civil monetary 
  penalties against any person who:&nbsp; 
<p>&quot;offers or transfers remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits 
  under [Federal health care programs (including Medicare or Medicaid)] that such 
  person knows or should know is likely to influence such individual to order 
  or receive from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier any item or 
  service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, [by a Federal health 
  care program].&quot; 
<p>Section 231(h) defines "remuneration" as including, <u>inter alia</u>, the 
  waiver of copayment and deductible amounts (or any part thereof). The statute 
  contains certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for certain waivers 
  of copayments that are not advertised, that are not routine, and that are granted 
  to financially needy patients or for which reasonable collection efforts have 
  been made. 
<p> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Analysis</u> </strong> 
<p>As was the case in OIG Advisory Opinion 98-6, under the Proposed Arrangement, 
  the NETT participating clinics and providers would waive deductible and copayment 
  amounts routinely and without regard to financial hardship.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  Thus, the Proposed Arrangement implicates the anti-kickback statute's proscription 
  against offering or paying something of value as an inducement to generate business 
  payable by a Federal health care program. Nevertheless, for the reasons articulated 
  in OIG Advisory Opinion 98-6 and summarized below, we conclude that in the particular 
  circumstances presented here, we would not impose sanctions arising under the 
  anti-kickback statute on the Requestors in connection with the Proposed Arrangement 
  (including the waiver of both Medicare Part A and Part B copayment and deductible 
  amounts). We further conclude that we would not impose sanctions under section 
  1128A(a)(5) of the Act, which prohibits giving something of value to a beneficiary 
  that the donor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's 
  choice of a particular provider, in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>Based on the facts presented, we find that the following factors adequately 
  protect the Proposed Arrangement against the risk of fraud or abuse: 
<ul>
  <li><u>The Proposed Arrangement is unlikely to influence beneficiaries to obtain 
    Medicare covered services from the NETT providers</u>. Medicare patients will 
    enroll in the NETT because enrollment in the NETT is the only means of obtaining 
    Medicare coverage of LVRS, not because copayments and deductibles are waived. 
    As a practical matter, Medicare beneficiaries have no choice of LVRS providers 
    outside of the NETT. Nor is the Proposed Arrangement likely to influence the 
    choice of providers within the NETT because all providers will waive deductibles 
    and copayments. In short, the purpose of the waivers of the NETT cost-sharing 
    amounts is to induce participation in a HCFA-sponsored scientific study, not 
    to induce utilization of Medicare covered services. 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>The Proposed Arrangement will not increase the risk of overutilization 
    of Medicare covered services</u>. The NETT Protocol controls utilization of 
    services, and the Proposed Arrangement would not apply to health care services 
    that are not included in the NETT Protocol. Nor would it apply for any period 
    of time during which a Medicare beneficiary ceases to be a NETT patient.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
    Thus, the Proposed Arrangement is unlikely to result in an increased risk 
    of overutilization of Medicare covered services.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
    In addition, the risk of increased overutilization is minimized because the 
    number of Medicare patients participating in the full NETT study will be limited 
    to 2,500 over a fifty-four month period.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
    This number may be even smaller, because some of the NETT patients may be 
    privately insured. 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>The Proposed Arrangement is a reasonable means of enhancing the likelihood 
    of success of the HCFA-sponsored NETT study</u>. Patient compliance with all 
    aspects of the study, including visits to the NETT participating clinics when 
    required and cooperation with follow-up data collection efforts, is essential 
    to producing valid study results. Patients may be disinclined to participate 
    fully for the duration of the study if they are required to pay to participate. 
    This may be particularly true for patients who are not randomized into the 
    surgical group or who are not satisfied with the outcome of their surgery. 
    The NETT reports that it is experiencing difficulties enrolling sufficient 
    numbers of eligible patients. In these circumstances, waiving copayments and 
    deductibles is a reasonable means of enhancing patient compliance with study 
    requirements and retaining patients for the entire study period. Waiving copayments 
    and deductibles will also ensure that economically disadvantaged patients 
    are not precluded from participating in the study. <strong></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, the Proposed Arrangement reasonably accommodates the needs of an important, 
  HCFA-sponsored scientific study, without posing a significant risk of fraud 
  and abuse of the Medicare program. 
<p>Nothing in this opinion should be taken to permit or protect waivers of Part 
  A or Part B copayments and deductibles provided in the context of clinical studies 
  generally. The Proposed Arrangement presents unique circumstances not found 
  in the context of many other research programs, chief among them HCFA sponsorship 
  of the NETT. 
<p><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>For the above-stated reasons, and based on the information provided, we conclude 
  that: (i) the Proposed Arrangement would potentially generate prohibited remuneration 
  under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce referrals 
  were present, but that, based on the totality of the facts as described and 
  certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions, the OIG will 
  not subject the Requestors to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with 
  the Proposed Arrangement; and (ii) the OIG will not subject the Requestors to 
  sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Arrangement as described and certified in your request letter and supplemental 
  submissions.

      Chief Counsel to the Inspector General 
    <p>[Attached Distribution List Redacted] 
    <p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>The legal effect of this conclusion is the same as 
      that reached in OIG Advisory Opinion 98-6 (April 20, 1998), in that the 
      OIG would not impose sanctions under sections 1128B(b) and 1128A(a)(5) of 
      the Act on the advisory opinion's requestors, in connection with each respective 
      advisory opinion request. <strong></strong> 
    <p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>For purposes of this advisory opinion, "Original 
      Requesting Parties" includes only those requesting parties from NETT Request 
      I who have signed on as requestors of NETT Request II. 
    <p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>Since the issuance of Advisory Opinion 98-6, the 
      expected patient sample size for the study has dropped from 4,700 to 2,500 
      due to revisions in the study's assumptions and the difficulties that the 
      NETT participating clinics have encountered in recruiting patients for the 
      study. 
    <p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions 
      related to the anti-kickback implications of the Proposed Arrangement are 
      based on violations of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis for purposes 
      of this advisory opinion is the same under both. 
    <p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>With respect to the NETT's economically disadvantaged 
      patients, individualized determinations of indigency might suffice to exempt 
      the NETT providers from their obligation to collect copayments and deductibles 
      for those specific patients. 
    <p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>It is anticipated that some people may begin the 
      initial screening process, be found ineligible for the study, but later 
      reapply and be admitted to the study. HCFA would not consider these patients 
      NETT patients for the period between the ineligibility determination and 
      the reapplication. 
    <p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>Nothing in this advisory opinion should be construed 
      as indicating that a showing of actual, or increased risk of, overutilization 
      is a required element of an anti-kickback statute violation. A risk of overutilization 
      is merely one potential indicator of potential fraud or abuse. 
    <p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>We recognize that an indeterminate number of patients 
      who do not ultimately qualify for the NETT may obtain some copayment and 
      deductible waivers during the screening process. The number of these patients 
      will be limited by the initial screening criteria. HCFA has agreed to reimburse 
      the NETT providers for services performed during the screening process in 
      order to ensure that the NETT study can serve the purposes for which it 
      is intended. We do not think that these limited waivers will lead to an 
      increased risk of abuse of the Medicare program.
