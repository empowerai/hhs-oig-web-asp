    <p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 00-6</strong> 
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear [Names Redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  Hospital&nbsp;X's proposed donation of its ownership interest in a portion of 
  a medical office building to an agency of the State of [name redacted] (the 
  "State") for use by the Medical School (the "Proposed Donation"). Specifically, 
  the question raised by your request is whether the Proposed Donation would constitute 
  grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the 
  Social Security Act (the "Act"), in the circumstances presented. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information provided in your request, including 
  all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete description 
  of the relevant facts and agreements among the parties. You have also certified 
  that, upon our approval, you will undertake to effectuate the Proposed Donation. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Proposed Donation could 
  potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the Office 
  of Inspector General ("OIG") will not subject the Medical School or Hospital 
  X (the "Requestors") to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Donation, as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental 
  submissions. 
<p>In accordance with our regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 1008, your advisory opinion 
  request disclosed a number of additional arrangements which directly or indirectly 
  involve the Requestors, and about which no opinion is being sought. This opinion 
  is limited to the Proposed Donation, and we express no opinion about any other 
  agreements or arrangements disclosed or referenced in your request letter or 
  supplemental submissions. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Requestors, 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part V below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Parties</strong> 
</blockquote>
<p>The<em> State Agency</em> is an agency of the State that oversees facilities, 
  programs, and policies related to students, staff, and faculty at institutions 
  within the State Agency. <em>University Y</em> is the division of the State 
  Agency that operates the <em>Medical School</em> in [city redacted] (the "City"), 
  State. University Y's faculty practice plan is operated by the <em>Faculty Practice 
  Plan</em>, a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation. 
<p>For purposes relevant to our analysis, we consider the State Agency, University 
  Y, the Medical School, and the Faculty Practice Plan to be sufficiently related 
  to be treated as a single entity. Therefore, for purposes of this advisory opinion, 
  each of the foregoing, as well as all entities that are owned or controlled, 
  in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by any of the foregoing and related, 
  directly or indirectly, to the operation of University&nbsp;Y (including, without 
  limitation, [names redacted]) will be referred to collectively as "<em>Entity 
  Y</em>."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Physicians employed by, or affiliated 
  with, University Y, the Medical School, the Faculty Practice Plan, or [names 
  redacted] (including, without limitation, the Teaching Physicians, as hereinafter 
  defined) will be referred to for purposes of this advisory opinion collectively 
  as "<em>Entity Y Physicians</em>." 
<p>Entity Y's medical education programs include a clinical component and an academic 
  component, both of which are administered by certain Entity Y Physicians. These 
  physicians (the "<em>Teaching Physicians</em>") are employed by the Faculty 
  Practice Plan for their clinical services, and, with a few minor exceptions, 
  by the Medical School for their academic services. Entity Y pays its Teaching 
  Physicians (i) a fixed annual salary for academic services provided on behalf 
  of the Medical School, and (ii) a fixed annual salary, together with a productivity 
  bonus, for clinical services provided through the Faculty Practice Plan. Teaching 
  Physicians, as well as other Entity Y Physicians, refer patients to Hospital 
  X and other area hospitals for the provision of various hospital and ancillary 
  services, some of which are reimbursable by Federal health care programs. However, 
  neither the fixed annual salaries nor the bonuses paid to Teaching Physicians 
  are related to the volume or value of referrals to Hospital X or any other institution. 
<p>Much of the State is medically underserved, and many of the medically underserved 
  areas are rural. The Medical School was created to alleviate the inadequate 
  number of physicians available to provide services in underserved areas and 
  to underserved populations. Thus, the Medical School provides medical education 
  and residency training programs with an emphasis on primary care and rural health 
  issues. 
<p><em>Hospital X</em> is a tax-exempt, nonprofit, academic medical center located 
  in City, State. Hospital X was originally organized as a public, city-county 
  community hospital known as [Hospital X's predecessor]. In 1987, the City and 
  [county redacted] county (the "County"), State, entered into a restructuring 
  agreement pursuant to which they permitted the transfer of the hospital's assets 
  and operations to the private, non-profit corporation currently known as Hospital&nbsp;X. 
<p>In structuring the transfer, Hospital X's continued support for the Medical 
  School and medical training was a matter of significant concern to both the 
  City and the County. The transfer was subject, in part, to the general condition 
  that Hospital X "continue the training and educational programs for health care 
  personnel similar to those heretofore conducted by [Hospital X's predecessor]." 
  Moreover, Hospital X and its predecessor concluded that "the facilities presently 
  housing the office practices of its medical staff physicians . . . [were] inadequate 
  to meet the needs of such physicians and fail[ed] to respond to the requirements 
  of the Medical School relating to the provision of ambulatory care." Therefore, 
  the transfer was subject to Hospital X making a [amount redacted] grant to Entity 
  Y (the "Grant") designated for the purpose of "acquiring, by purchase, lease 
  or otherwise, constructing, furnishing, and equipping a medical diagnostic clinic 
  and office practice center for physician employees and staff members of [the 
  Medical School]." Pursuant to the Grant, the location of the building was to 
  be "within [the City] at such location as may be selected by the President of 
  [University Y] with the concurrence of the [University Y] Advisory Board." 
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>B. The Medical Center</strong> 
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Medical Center</em> is a six story building consisting of clearly defined 
  areas devoted solely to clinical endeavors (the "Clinical Areas") and clearly 
  defined areas devoted solely to academic endeavors (the "Academic Areas"). The 
  Academic Areas are owned in undivided interests by Hospital X ([n%]) and Entity 
  Y ([(100-n)%]). As a result of Entity&nbsp;Y's recent and partial exercise of 
  its purchase option (as more fully described below), Entity Y is currently the 
  sole owner of the Clinical Areas. 
<p>The Academic Areas are located in the outer rim of all six floors of the Medical 
  Center, and the Clinical Areas are located within the inner portions of each 
  floor. The Academic Areas are not designed for the performance of any clinical 
  activity, and are used for faculty office space, medical school classrooms, 
  and other medical education purposes related to the graduate and postgraduate 
  medical education programs that Entity Y operates in cooperation with Hospital 
  X. The Clinical Areas are used for the provision of clinical services. 
<p>In 1992, Entity Y selected Hospital X's campus as the location for the Medical 
  Center and, together with Hospital X, undertook construction of the Medical 
  Center. The Requestors have certified that, at the time of site selection and 
  at the commencement of construction, there was a common understanding that each 
  party would bear its respective share of the financial burden. Upon completion 
  of construction in 1998, both the Academic Areas <u>and</u> the Clinical Areas 
  of the Medical Center were owned in undivided interests as follows: [n%] by 
  Hospital X and [(100-n)%] by Entity Y. 
<p>Entity Y's participation in the construction was based, in part, on initial 
  pre-construction analyses conducted in 1995. As initially conceived (the "Original 
  Model"), the building was to house two distinct components: (i) a provider-based 
  outpatient clinic that would have been wholly-owned by Hospital X and staffed 
  by Teaching Physicians, and (ii) academic office space for the Medical School's 
  faculty members (i.e., the Teaching Physicians) that would have been wholly-owned 
  by Entity Y. Because Hospital X and Entity Y would have owned their respective 
  portions of the building, neither would have incurred rental charges under the 
  Original Model. 
<p>Subsequent regulatory and statutory developments substantially altered the 
  assumptions upon which the initial financing projections were based, and the 
  design of the Original Model was changed significantly. In particular, under 
  the revised model (the "Revised Model"), the clinical space was changed from 
  a provider-based outpatient clinic to free-standing physician offices. Moreover, 
  it was determined that Entity Y and Hospital X would be given their respective 
  percentage ownership interests as undivided interests in the whole building. 
  Notwithstanding the design change, the end result (i.e., creation of a modern 
  facility in which Teaching Physicians would provide both academic and clinical 
  services) remained the same. 
<p>Once the Medical Center was ready for occupancy, Hospital X and Entity Y, as 
  owners and lessors of <u>both</u> the Academic Areas and Clinical Areas of the 
  Medical Center, entered into two written leases with Entity Y, as lessee: one 
  for the Academic Areas and one for the Clinical Areas. The lease for the Academic 
  Areas permits Entity Y, in its capacity as lessee, to defer rental payments 
  until September 30, 2000, and Entity Y has elected deferment.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  In addition, the lease for the Academic Areas granted Entity Y an option (the 
  "Option") to purchase Hospital X's ownership interest in the Medical Center. 
  Recently, Entity Y exercised its Option with respect to the <u>Clinical</u> 
  Areas only.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> As a result, Entity Y is currently 
  the sole owner of the <u>Clinical</u> Areas.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  Entity Y did <u>not</u> exercise its Option with respect to the <u>Academic</u> 
  Areas. Therefore, Hospital X still owns [n%] of the Academic Areas and Entity 
  Y still owns the remaining [(100-n)%] of the Academic Areas. 
<p>Under the Revised Model, Entity Y incurs rental charges, and will make rental 
  payments, for the same academic space that it would have had access to, under 
  the Original Model, without incurring any rental charges. The Requestors have 
  certified that payment of these rental charges would severely strain Entity 
  Y's financial resources and jeopardize other services. 
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>C. The Proposed Donation</strong> 
</blockquote>
<p>Hospital X proposes to donate its existing [n%] interest in the <u>Academic 
  Areas</u> of the Medical Center to Entity Y. The Proposed Donation would be 
  retroactive to Entity Y's initial occupancy of the Academic Areas, and the only 
  condition would be that the Academic Areas must be used for medical academic 
  purposes. After the Proposed Donation, the Academic Areas would continue to 
  be used by Entity Y just as they are currently. 
<p>The Proposed Donation would not be subject to any explicit or implicit requirements 
  as to the use of the Clinical Areas or referrals to Hospital X. In addition, 
  Entity Y has certified as follows: 
<ul>
  <li>Entity Y will not require or encourage Entity Y Physicians to refer patients 
    to Hospital X or any other institution.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Entity Y will not track referrals made by Entity Y Physicians to Hospital 
    X or any other institution.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Compensation paid to Entity Y Physicians (including, without limitation, 
    base salaries paid for Teaching Physicians' clinical or academic services 
    and variable bonuses paid for their clinical services) will not be related 
    to the volume or value of referrals by such physicians to Hospital X or any 
    other institution. Such compensation will be consistent with fair market value 
    in arm's-length transactions. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>On an annual basis, Entity Y will provide written notice of the limitations 
    described in each of the three foregoing paragraphs to all Entity Y Physicians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hospital X has certified that it has not, and will not, provide to Entity Y 
  any free or below market value goods or services that are directly or indirectly 
  related to the Academic Areas, including, without limitation, all utilities 
  (e.g., sewer charges, water, gas, electricity, telephone and every other service 
  supplied to Entity Y or used upon, or in connection with, the Academic Areas), 
  expenses, real estate taxes and all other taxes associated with or assessed 
  against the Academic Areas. 
<p><strong>II. THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: 
<p>Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] any 
  remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony. 
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>III. ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The OIG's position on the provision of free or below market value goods or 
  services to referral sources is longstanding and clear: such arrangements are 
  suspect. That is, the provision of free goods or services to any referral source 
  may violate the anti-kickback statute if one purpose of the gift is to induce 
  or reward referrals of Federal program business. In general, such arrangements 
  give rise to an inference that one purpose of the gift is to induce referrals. 
<p>The Proposed Donation is as straightforward as it is problematic: a substantial 
  one-time donation by a hospital to a major referral source. (Since Entity Y 
  employs, and is affiliated with, physicians who make referrals to Hospital X, 
  Entity Y is a referral source for Hospital X.) Accordingly, the Proposed Donation 
  implicates the Federal anti-kickback statute. 
<p>However, for the following reasons, we would not impose sanctions in connection 
  with the Proposed Donation. <u>First</u>, the transaction is between components 
  of an academic medical center that historically have shared both a common mission 
  in training physicians for, and providing quality medical care to, the people 
  of the State and a common heritage as public institutions. We recognize that 
  the relationships among components of academic medical centers are often organizationally 
  and financially complex. The Requestors have certified that, at the time of 
  site selection and at the commencement of construction, there was a common understanding 
  that each party would bear its respective share of the financial burden. Given 
  the Requestors' shared history, mission, and public provenance, the Proposed 
  Donation appears to be a reasonable accommodation to changed financial circumstances 
  and consistent with the Requestors' shared charitable mission. 
<p><u>Second</u>, Entity Y has certified that it will take a number of steps to 
  insulate physician judgment and income from pressure to refer to Hospital X, 
  including the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Entity Y will not require or encourage Entity Y Physicians to refer patients 
    to Hospital X or any other institution.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Entity Y will not track referrals made by Entity Y Physicians to Hospital 
    X or any other institution.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Compensation paid to Entity Y Physicians (including, without limitation, 
    base salaries paid for Teaching Physicians' clinical or academic services 
    and variable bonuses paid for their clinical services) will not be related 
    to the volume or value of referrals by such physicians to Hospital X or any 
    other institution. Such compensation will be consistent with fair market value 
    in arm's-length transactions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>On an annual basis, Entity Y will provide written notice of the limitations 
    described in each of the three foregoing paragraphs to all Entity Y Physicians. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Entity Y's ability to direct the referrals of Entity Y Physicians will 
  be significantly constrained. 
<p><u>Third</u>, the Proposed Donation will confer a community benefit on the 
  residents of the City and the State. The State continues to have many medically 
  underserved areas, many of which are rural. As part of the State's effort to 
  alleviate the inadequate number of physicians providing services in underserved 
  areas and to underserved populations, the Medical School specializes in rural 
  health issues and training of primary care physicians. 
<p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>For all of the above reasons, and based on the information provided, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Donation could potentially generate prohibited remuneration 
  under the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals 
  were present, but that the OIG will not subject the Medical School or Hospital 
  X to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under sections 1128(b)(7) 
  or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Donation, as described 
  and certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions. This opinion 
  is limited to the Proposed Donation and, therefore, we express no opinion about 
  any other agreements or arrangements disclosed or referenced in your request 
  letter or supplemental submissions. 
<p><strong>V. LIMITATIONS</strong> 
<p>The limitations applicable to this opinion include the following: 
<ul>

    involving an entity or individual that is not a requestor to this opinion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above. No opinion is herein expressed or implied with respect to the 
    application of any other Federal, state, or local statute, rule, regulation, 
    ordinance, or other law that may be applicable to the Proposed Donation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    which appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No opinion is expressed herein regarding the liability of any party under 
    the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, 
    claims submission, cost reporting, or related conduct. </li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p>The OIG will not proceed against the Requestors with respect to any action 
  that is part of the Proposed Donation taken in good faith reliance upon this 
  advisory opinion as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, 
  and accurately presented, and the Proposed Donation in practice comports with 
  the information provided. The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions 
  and issues raised in this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, 
  rescind, modify or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion 
  is modified or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the Requestors with 
  respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, 
  where all of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented 
  and where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG.

<p>1. Notwithstanding, as more fully set forth in Part V below and in 42 C.F.R. 
  Part 1008, this opinion is issued only to, and can only be relied upon by, the 
  Requestors. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. Deferred rental payments accrue interest and must be secured. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. Entity Y financed its purchase of the Clinical Areas through the issuance 
  of tax-exempt revenue bonds. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. The lease for the Clinical Areas formerly existing between Hospital X and 
  Entity Y, as owners and lessors of the Clinical Areas, and Entity Y, as lessee, 
  was terminated, and a new lease for the Clinical Areas was executed with the 
  State Agency, as lessor, and the Faculty Practice Plan, as lessee. The State 
  Agency will use the rental payments it receives under this new lease to retire 
  the bonds described <em>supra</em> note 3. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. Consistent with its responsibilities as a teaching institution, the Medical 
  School requires Teaching Physicians to admit patients only to facilities that 
  have an academic affiliation with the Medical School. All hospitals within the 
  City or the County have such an affiliation with the Medical School. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. Consistent with accreditation and similar requirements, for purposes of 
  medical student and resident teaching and supervision, the Medical School keeps 
  records of where Teaching Physicians perform procedures, but the Medical School 
  has certified that it does not use those records for any purpose relating to 
  setting physician compensation or influencing choice of hospital. <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Donation are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. <a name="N_8_"></a>
