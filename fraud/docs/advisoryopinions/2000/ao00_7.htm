  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: <br>
  <br>
  We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  free transportation services that Hospital X ("Hospital X" or the "Requestor") 
  offers to certain patients who have been referred to Hospital X for extended 
  courses of treatment involving chemotherapy, dialysis, radiation therapy, cardio/pulmonary 
  rehabilitation treatment, or certain similar services (the "Arrangement"). Specifically, 
  the question raised by your request is whether the Arrangement constitutes grounds 
  for sanctions under the civil monetary penalty provision prohibiting inducements 
  to beneficiaries, section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), 
  or the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, in the circumstances 
  presented. <br>
  <br>
  You have certified that all of the information provided in your request, including 
  all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete description 
  of the relevant facts and agreements among the parties. <br>
  <br>
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the information provided, we conclude that: (i) the Office of Inspector 
  General ("OIG") will not impose a civil monetary penalty under section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act on Hospital X in connection with the Arrangement, as described and 
  certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions; and (ii) the 
  Arrangement could potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent were present, but that the OIG will not subject 
  Hospital X to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under sections 
  1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement, as 
  described and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Hospital X, and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p>&nbsp; <strong> I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>Hospital X is a not-for-profit health care system located in City A, State 
  B. Hospital X has three City A locations at which medical services are provided: 
<ul>
  <li>the West Campus, where acute care services, emergency services, cancer care, 
    cardiac care, cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services, diagnostic services, 
    and other services are provided. Hospital X's [number redacted]-bed acute 
    care hospital, the only acute care hospital in City A, and its [name redacted] 
    Cancer Center are located on this campus; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>the East Campus, where outpatient clinic services and medical rehabilitation 
    services are provided for patients who suffer from spinal cord injury, stroke, 
    amputation, brain trauma, and musculoskeletal diseases; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>the [name redacted] Dialysis Center. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hospital X's primary service area encompasses not only City A, but a ten-county 
  rural area in [area redacted] State B covering [over 8,000] square miles. Many 
  of the counties within Hospital X's primary service area are rural or contain 
  medically underserved areas and populations. Hospital X is the only provider 
  of radiation oncology within its primary service area. Moreover, within Hospital 
  X's primary service area, there is only one other provider of dialysis services, 
  and there are only two other providers of cardiac rehabilitation services. <br>
  <br>
  Public transportation within Hospital X's primary service area is very limited. 
  Within the City A city limits, there is one taxi service, which has five or 
  fewer vehicles, and a single "Handibus," which runs on a set schedule and provides 
  transportation to handicapped individuals. No public transportation is available 
  outside the City A city limits. <br>
  <br>
  The Arrangement is set forth in a written policy which describes in detail Hospital 
  X's free transportation policy and procedures. Under the Arrangement, Hospital 
  X uses two of its own vehicles to provide free one-way or round-trip general 
  transportation services between Hospital X and each eligible patient's residence. 
  Transportation is only provided to patients who reside within Hospital X's primary 
  service area or for whom Hospital X is the nearest provider of the prescribed 
  treatments. The transportation services are <u>not</u> ambulance-level services, 
  and no state license is required. Notwithstanding, most drivers have a current 
  state emergency medical technician ("EMT") license, which allows them to respond 
  appropriately if a medical emergency arises en route. To be eligible for the 
  free transportation services, a patient must: (i)&nbsp;have been referred to 
  Hospital X for an extended course of treatment involving chemotherapy, dialysis, 
  radiation therapy, cardio/pulmonary rehabilitation treatment, or certain similar 
  services; (ii) be unable to provide his or her own transportation and have no 
  other regular and reliable means of transportation (public or private); and 
  (iii) be at significant medical risk if treatment is not provided. <br>
  <br>
  Hospital X does not charge the patient or any third party payor for the transportation 
  services. General transportation, such as the type offered by Hospital X under 
  the Arrangement, is not reimbursable under any Federal health care program. 
  Hospital X has certified that the costs of the free transportation services 
  will not be claimed directly or indirectly on any Federal health care program 
  cost report or claim or otherwise shifted to any Federal health care program. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital X has not, and will not, market or advertise the availability of its 
  free transportation services. Under the Arrangement, Hospital X's hospital staff 
  are instructed that, in the course of arranging for extended courses of treatment, 
  they should be alert for those patients who indicate an inability to obtain 
  regular and reliable transportation to and from Hospital X, obtain information 
  from the patients about their particular circumstances, and recommend such patients 
  to the appropriate department director for review. If the department director 
  determines that the patient meets the eligibility requirements described above, 
  the department director offers free transportation services to the patient, 
  and upon acceptance of the offer, refers the patient to the Patient Transportation 
  Department. The Patient Transportation Department prioritizes the referred patients' 
  requests based upon medical need, travel distance, the number of other patients 
  needing transportation, and the time of treatment. Hospital X has certified 
  that neither referrals made by Hospital X's hospital staff, decisions made by 
  department directors, nor decisions made by the Patient Transportation Department 
  will be based, directly or indirectly, upon the patient's ability to pay for 
  the underlying medical services or the existence, nature, or extent of the patient's 
  insurance coverage. <br>
  <br>
  Historically, Hospital X has offered free transportation services to a limited 
  number of patients, averaging approximately 6% of all radiation oncology, dialysis, 
  and cardio/pulmonary patients. The average age of individuals receiving transportation 
  under the Arrangement is sixty-six, and the average distance of the transportation 
  is twenty-eight miles. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> &nbsp; 
<p><strong>A. Fraud and Abuse Implications of Free Transportation Services</strong> 
<p>Health care providers that offer free goods or services, such as free transportation 
  services, to Federal health care beneficiaries may be subject to civil monetary 
  penalties. In section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, Congress specifically addressed 
  the issue of providers offering remuneration to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 
  in order to influence their selection of a particular provider by authorizing 
  the imposition of civil monetary penalties against such providers. Moreover, 
  free transportation services may implicate the criminal anti-kickback statute 
  which prohibits offering anything of value to any "person" (including a Federal 
  health care beneficiary) to reward or induce referrals (including self-referrals) 
  for items or services reimbursable under any Federal health care program.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Given the overlap between the two statutes, we will begin with some general 
  observations about free transportation services.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <u>First</u>, we recognize that many arrangements involving free transportation 
  have important and beneficial effects on patient care, especially where such 
  arrangements are narrowly tailored to address issues of financial need, limited 
  transportation resources, treatment compliance, or safety. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Second</u>, we also recognize that free transportation services are sometimes 
  an integral part of fraudulent or abusive schemes which lead to inappropriate 
  steering of patients, overutilization, and the provision of medically unnecessary 
  services. Examples of abusive arrangements involving free transportation services 
  include: 
<ul>
  <li> Psychiatric facilities offering out-of-state patients free round-trip airline 
    tickets to Florida in order to receive services at their facilities; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Van drivers soliciting, and offering free transportation services to, Medicaid 
    patients for health care providers who compensate the drivers on a per patient 
    or per service basis; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Unscrupulous health care providers offering residents of nursing facilities 
    and other congregate care facilities free transportation services to and from 
    their offices for services that are frequently of questionable necessity;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Hospitals offering patients free limousine services; and </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Hospitals offering patients free ambulance services without making individual 
    determinations of financial need.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Third</u>, given their potential for abuse, we evaluate arrangements involving 
  free transportation services on a case-by-case basis. We have identified several 
  risk factors including, but not limited to, the following: 
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The population to whom free transportation services are offered.</strong> 
    While free transportation services offered to "all comers" can implicate section 
    1128A(a)(5) of the Act and the anti-kickback statute, so can free transportation 
    services offered to select patients or populations. To the extent the services 
    are offered selectively, we evaluate the basis on which the selection is made. 
    For example, an offeror of free transportation services might select individuals 
    based upon one or more of the following criteria: relationship with the offeror 
    (including physician-patient relationships); relationship with other providers 
    (including nursing facility-resident relationships); diagnosis; insurance 
    coverage; geographic location; financial need; or concerns regarding safety 
    or treatment compliance. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The nature or type of free transportation services offered.</strong> 
    Expensive transportation services such as limousines, airline tickets, or 
    ambulance transports raise greater concerns. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The geographic area in which free transportation services are offered.</strong> 
    Services offered within a provider's historic service area are less suspect 
    than services offered outside its historic service area. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The availability and affordability of alternate means of transportation.</strong> 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Whether free transportation services are marketed or advertised 
    and, if so, how.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The type of provider offering the free transportation services.</strong> 
    Free transportation services offered by individual or small groups of providers, 
    including physicians, or by freestanding clinics are subject to greater scrutiny. 
    Historically, unscrupulous providers and clinics have offered free transportation 
    services in conjunction with Medicare and Medicaid mills. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Whether the costs of the free transportation services will be claimed 
    directly or indirectly on any Federal health care program cost report or claim 
    or otherwise shifted to any Federal health care program.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>These factors are not exclusive, and the presence or absence of any one factor 
  is not determinative of whether the OIG would subject parties to sanctions for 
  providing free transportation services to patients. 
<p><u>Fourth</u>, we weigh these factors, as well as other relevant concerns, 
  in assessing the level of risk presented by an arrangement. They are not necessarily 
  determinative or probative of whether an arrangement violates the applicable 
  statutes. The elements required for a violation of the statutes are discussed 
  below. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>B. Application of Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act provides for the imposition of civil monetary 
  penalties against any person who: 
<ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> offers or transfers remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits 
      under [Medicare or a State health care program] that such person knows or 
      should know is likely to influence such individual to order or receive from 
      a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier any item or service for 
      which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under [Medicare or a State 
      health care program]. 
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<p><u>See also</u> 65 Fed. Reg. 24400, 24416 (April 26, 2000) (to be codified 
  at 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.102(b)(13)). Section 1128A(i)(6) of the Act defines 
  "remuneration" for purposes of section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act as including, 
  among other things, "transfers of items or services for free or for other than 
  fair market value." Unlike the anti-kickback statute, section 1128A(a)(5) of 
  the Act is solely concerned with remuneration offered or transferred to Medicare 
  or State health care program beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Although free transportation services clearly fall within the ambit of the prohibition, 
  legislative history indicates that, in enacting section 1128A(a)(5), Congress 
  did not intend to impose civil monetary penalties against persons offering complimentary 
  local transportation of nominal value. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-736, at 255 (1996). 
  In the preamble to 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.102(b)(13), the final rule addressing 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, we interpreted nominal value for purposes of 
  section 1128A(a)(5) to be no more than $10 per item, or $50 in the aggregate 
  on an annual basis. 65 Fed. Reg. 24400, 24411 (April 26, 2000). Moreover, we 
  theorized that "frequent rendering of items or services to any individual may 
  preclude such items and services from being classified as nominal in value." 
  <u>Id</u>. at 24407. However, many free transports, including many of those 
  provided under the Arrangement, exceed the nominal value and local service limits. 
<p>Notwithstanding, for all of the following reasons, we will not subject Hospital 
  X to civil monetary penalties under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection 
  with the Arrangement: 
<ul>
  <li> There is either limited or no economical means of public transportation 
    in the geographic area where Hospital X provides the free transportation services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The free transportation services are not advertised and are available only 
    to individuals who have already been referred to, or are being treated at, 
    Hospital X.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The free transportation services are available only if there has been an 
    individualized determination of need (i.e., the patient has no other regular 
    and reliable means of transportation).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The free transportation services are available to all qualified patients 
    who require a course of multiple treatments, subject to available resources. 
    The Arrangement is not limited to, or targeted at, particular profitable treatments 
    or patient populations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The costs of the free transportation services will not be claimed directly 
    or indirectly on any Federal health care program cost report or claim or otherwise 
    shifted to any Federal health care program. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The geographic area within which the free transportation services are offered 
    is limited to Hospital X's historic primary service area, the size of which 
    is determined in part by its rural location, and other areas that include 
    patients for whom Hospital X is the nearest provider of the prescribed treatments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> Consistent with Hospital X's not-for-profit mission, the Arrangement provides 
    a benefit to the community by giving elderly and low-income Hospital X patients 
    access to medically necessary, life-prolonging treatments that they may otherwise 
    forego, in whole or in part, because of inadequate transportation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> C. Application of the Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] 
      any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or 
      indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce 
      such person -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or 
      arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may 
      be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, 
      lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering 
      any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole 
      or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of a felony. 
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Id</u>. Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. <br>
  <br>
  The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose 
  of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services or to induce 
  further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); 
  <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 
  474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony punishable 
  by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. Conviction 
  will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, including 
  Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  Remuneration from a hospital to a patient that is intended to induce the patient 
  to obtain hospital services implicates the anti-kickback statute. For example, 
  the routine waiver of Medicare Part B coinsurance -- a payment obligation required 
  by Federal law -- implicates the anti-kickback statute, as would offers of cash 
  or other valuable gifts that are intended to induce patients to order services 
  paid for in whole or in part by a Federal health care program. Free transportation 
  services offered by a hospital to Federal health care program beneficiaries 
  may have monetary value and implicate the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce self-referrals is present. Notwithstanding, in the instant 
  case, for all of the reasons set forth above in the analysis of section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act, we will not subject Hospital X to sanctions for violations arising 
  under the Federal anti-kickback statute in connection with the Arrangement. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> <br>
  <br>
  For all of the above reasons, and based on the information provided, we conclude 
  that: (i) the OIG will not impose a civil monetary penalty under section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act on Hospital X in connection with the Arrangement, as described and 
  certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions; and (ii) the 
  Arrangement could potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent were present, but that the OIG will not subject 
  Hospital X to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under sections 
  1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement, as 
  described and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions.
