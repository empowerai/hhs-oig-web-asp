  Re: Advisory Opinion 98-12 
<p>Gentlemen: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  whether a proposed joint venture among several orthopedic surgeons and anesthesiologists 
  specializing in pain management to establish an ambulatory surgical center, 
  as described in your request letter and supplemental submissions (the "Proposed 
  Arrangement"), would generate prohibited remuneration within the meaning of 
  the anti-kickback statute pursuant to section 1128B(b) of the Social Security 
  Act. 
<p>Dr. A, Dr. B, Dr. C, Dr. D, and Dr. E (collectively, the "Requestors") have 
  certified that all of the information provided in the request, including all 
  supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete description 
  of the relevant facts and agreements among the parties. The Requestors have 
  also certified that, upon our approval, they will undertake to effectuate the 
  Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Arrangement could potentially generate prohibited remuneration 
  under the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals 
  were present, but that the OIG will not subject the Proposed Arrangement, as 
  described in the request letter and supplemental submissions, to sanctions arising 
  under the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Requestors 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
  <br>
<p> <strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> <br>
<p>The requesting physicians, Drs. A, B, C, D, and E (the "Physician-Investors"), 
  propose establishing an ambulatory surgical center (the "ASC") designed primarily 
  for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions resulting from work and sports-related 
  injuries. Two of the Physician-Investors are anesthesiologists specializing 
  in pain management;<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> three are orthopedic surgeons 
  specializing in work and/or sports-related injuries. 
<p>The ASC will be formed either as a State M corporation or a State M limited 
  liability company. The Physician-Investors have represented that the ASC will 
  be a certified ambulatory surgical center under 42 C.F.R. Part 416. The ASC 
  will consist of two operating rooms and will offer a full range of state-of-the-art 
  surgical equipment, including arthroscopy units, carbon-fiber tables, a fluoroscope, 
  orthopedic surgical instrumentation, and other mechanical and implantable devices 
  used in arthroscopic and pain management procedures. The ASC will employ a facility 
  administrator to manage and administer services for the ASC, as well as nurses, 
  surgical technicians, janitorial staff, and other administrative personnel. 
<p>The Physician-Investors will be the shareholders of the corporation, or the 
  owner-members of the limited liability company, and will make substantial capital 
  contributions to the ASC. The total capital contribution to establish the ASC 
  will be approximately $X. The capital contributions will vary, but each Physician-Investor 
  will contribute at least $Y. The Physician-Investors have certified that the 
  amount of their capital contributions will not be based on any expected volume 
  of referrals to the other Physician-Investors. The Physician-Investors will 
  receive voting and distribution rights proportional to their investments. In 
  addition to their capital contributions, the Physician-Investors will personally 
  guarantee payment under the lease for the ASC's premises. 
<p>The Physician-Investors expect to utilize the ASC as their preferred ambulatory 
  surgical center for procedures for which it is appropriately equipped. The Physician-Investors 
  have represented that each Physician-Investor will perform the majority of his 
  ambulatory surgical center procedures at the ASC. For purposes of this opinion, 
  ambulatory surgical center procedures are Medicare-covered surgical and other 
  medical procedures included on the applicable list of ambulatory surgical center 
  covered procedures published by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
  in the <u>Federal Register</u> ("ASC Procedures"). <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 
  416.65(c).<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> ASC Procedures currently include 
  certain pain management procedures performed by the Physician-Investors who 
  are anesthesiologists.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Although the ASC will 
  be available for use by non-investor physicians, the Physician-Investors will 
  be given priority scheduling and have represented that they will perform over 
  80% of the total procedures performed at the ASC. All ancillary services performed 
  at or by the ASC will be integrally related to the primary procedure a Physician-Investor 
  is performing at the ASC. The Physician-Investors have certified that Medicare 
  reimbursement will account for approximately five percent of the ASC annual 
  revenue.
<p>The practice of procedures in ambulatory surgical centers is an integral and 
  major part of each Physician-Investor's medical practice. For the period from 
  January 1, 1998, through May 31, 1998, at least 40% of each Physician-Investor's 
  total medical practice income was generated from performing ASC Procedures. 
  The Physician-Investors anticipate continuing to derive this percentage of medical 
  practice income from such procedures.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p>Each of the Physician-Investors will directly bill his patients and related 
  third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, for the professional component 
  of the ASC Procedures he performs. The ASC will separately bill the facility 
  fee and any technical component to such patients and third-party payers. The 
  Physician-Investors will provide their patients with a written disclosure of 
  their ownership in the ASC, explaining that they are referring patients to the 
  ASC. <br>
<p> <strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> <br>
<p> <strong>A. The Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 
  1320a-7b(b). Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals of 
  items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes criminal liability to 
  parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything 
  of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violations of the statute constitute a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from the Federal and State health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(5) of the Act.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
<p> <strong>B. Joint Ventures</strong> 
<p>This Office has long been concerned with the risk of abuse posed by health 
  care joint ventures in which investors are also sources of referrals or suppliers 
  of items or services to the joint venture. In 1989, the Office of Inspector 
  General issued a "Special Fraud Alert" specifically addressing joint venture 
  arrangements.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> The Special Fraud Alert distinguishes 
  between those joint ventures that are clearly legitimate and those that are 
  suspect under the anti-kickback statute. A joint venture may be suspect when 
  physicians are both investors in the joint venture and are in a position to 
  refer to the joint venture. Under these circumstances, remuneration paid to 
  the physicians in exchange for referrals may be disguised as profit distributions. 
  Such suspect joint ventures: 
<p> . . . may be intended not so much to raise investment capital legitimately 
  to start a business, but to lock up a stream of referrals from the physician 
  investors and to compensate them indirectly for these referrals. Because physician 
  investors can benefit financially from their referrals, unnecessary procedures 
  and tests may be ordered or performed, resulting in unnecessary program expenditures. 
<p>59 Fed. Reg. 65373-74 (Dec. 19, 1994). Substantial ownership by investors who 
  are in a position to refer patients to the joint venture ("Interested Investors") 
  is an indicator of a suspect joint venture because such ownership increases 
  the likelihood that the joint venture's primary purpose is to control a stream 
  of referrals. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. 35969 (July 29, 1991). Other factors that 
  could indicate potentially unlawful activity include the Interested Investors' 
  receiving a disproportionate return on their investments, and the joint venture 
  being structured as a "shell" for use by on-going entities already engaged in 
  a particular line of business. 
<p>Nevertheless, we recognize that some joint venture arrangements do not pose 
  a risk of fraud and abuse under the anti-kickback statute. We have promulgated 
  two safe harbors that describe joint ventures involving Interested Investors 
  that do not violate the statute: the investment interests in large publicly 
  traded entities safe harbor and the investment interests in small entities safe 
  harbor. 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(a)(1) &amp; (2) . An important common element 
  in both safe harbors is evidence of a significant business operation independent 
  of any "tainted referrals". The requirements of the safe harbor for investments 
  in large publicly traded entities ensure that referring investors will own such 
  a small share of the total stock issuance that the return on investment is, 
  at most, tangentially related to any referrals. <u>See</u> 54 Fed. Reg. 3090 
  (Jan. 23, 1989). Similarly, the small entities safe harbor places substantial 
  limitations both on the amount of investment in the business by referring investors 
  and on the amount of business revenue generated by any "tainted" referrals. 
<p>In sum, the current safe harbors protect against possible illegal remuneration 
  by ensuring that Interested Investors are not in a position to dominate the 
  joint venture's business, thereby increasing the likelihood that the joint venture 
  has an independent and legitimate business purpose, and that any return on investment 
  derives predominantly from such business. <br>
<p> <strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement is the antithesis of the small entity investment safe 
  harbor business structure. All of the investors will be referral sources to 
  the ASC, and virtually all such business of the ASC will be from investor referrals. 
  Nevertheless, for the reasons and in the circumstances set out below, we conclude 
  that although the Proposed Arrangement may potentially violate the anti-kickback 
  statute, we would not impose sanctions. 
<p>At the outset, we note that the Health Care Financing Administration promotes 
  ambulatory surgical centers as a cost-effective alternative to higher cost settings, 
  such as hospital inpatient surgery facilities. Many patients prefer treatment 
  in less intensive settings, such as ambulatory surgical centers. Thus, ambulatory 
  surgical centers benefit both the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. 
<p>This Office has proposed a safe harbor to protect surgeons who, as an extension 
  of their personal office practice, routinely perform procedures in ambulatory 
  surgical centers in which they have investment interests. <u>See</u> 58 Fed. 
  Reg. 49013 (Sept. 21, 1993). There are obvious and legitimate business and professional 
  reasons for surgeons to want to own an ambulatory surgical center in which they 
  will personally perform services on a routine basis. These reasons include personal 
  and patient convenience, professional autonomy, accountability, and quality 
  control. Moreover, any risk of overutilization or unnecessary surgery is already 
  present by reason of the opportunity for a surgeon to generate his professional 
  fee; the additional financial return from the ambulatory surgical center investment 
  is not likely to increase the risk of overutilization substantially. 
<p>Notwithstanding, this Office is concerned about the potential for investments 
  in ambulatory surgical centers to serve as vehicles to reward referring physicians 
  indirectly. For example, a primary care physician, who performs little or no 
  services in an ambulatory surgical center in which he has an ownership interest, 
  may refer to surgeons utilizing the ambulatory surgical center, thereby receiving 
  indirect remuneration for the referral through the ambulatory surgical center's 
  profit distribution. Similarly, an investment by orthopedic surgeons in an ambulatory 
  surgical center that is not equipped for orthopedic surgical procedures, or 
  that is exclusively used by anesthesiologists performing pain management procedures 
  on patients referred by the orthopedic surgeons, would be suspect. 
<p>The situation presented here is very different. First, all Physician-Investors 
  will be making substantial financial investments in the ASC and incurring financial 
  exposure for the ASC's lease. Second, although not all Physician-Investors are 
  surgeons, each Physician-Investor has certified that he currently derives, and 
  anticipates continuing to derive, at least 40% of his aggregate medical practice 
  income from ASC Procedures. In addition, each Physician-Investor has certified 
  that he will perform the majority of his ASC Procedures in the ASC. Third, given 
  that the revenue from procedures on Medicare beneficiaries is estimated to be 
  only 5% of the ASC's total revenues, any income from procedures performed on 
  referred Medicare patients will be insubstantial compared to the income from 
  procedures performed on the Physician-Investors' own patients. Fourth, any return 
  on investment to the Physician-Investors will be proportional to their capital 
  investments, and not based on referrals. In these circumstances, the Proposed 
  Arrangement is substantively equivalent to an "all surgeon" ambulatory surgical 
  center and presents a minimal risk that the return on investment would be a 
  disguised payment for referrals. 
<p>Finally, the Physician-Investors will provide their patients with a written 
  disclosure of their ownership in the ASC, explaining that they are referring 
  patients to the ASC. This written disclosure is required by State M law. [State 
  M Statutory Compilation.] While we do not believe that disclosure to patients 
  offers sufficient protection from program abuse, effective and meaningful disclosure 
  offers some protection against possible abuses of patient trust. <br>
<p><strong>III. Conclusion</strong> 
<p>Based on the facts certified in the Physician-Investors' request for an advisory 
  opinion and supplemental submissions, we conclude that while the Proposed Arrangement 
  might technically violate the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent 
  to induce referrals were present, the OIG will not impose sanctions on the Physician-Investors 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act. <br>

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>The anesthesiologists will exclusively practice pain 
  medicine at the ASC, except in emergency circumstances. Pain medicine involves 
  treating those patients who suffer from disorders that result in pain emanating 
  from a discrete cause, e.g., postoperative pain or pain associated with malignancy, 
  or from a syndrome in which pain constitutes the primary problem, e.g., neuropathic 
  pains or headaches. Treatments include central and peripheral neural blockade 
  and monitored drug infusions. <u>See</u> Definition of "Pain Medicine" adopted 
  by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (October 
  1997). 
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>Section 416.65 establishes standards that surgical and 
  other medical procedures must meet to be included on the HCFA list of procedures 
  eligible for facility fee reimbursement when performed in an ambulatory surgical 
  center. Eligible procedures include procedures that are commonly performed on 
  an inpatient basis in hospitals, but that may be safely performed in ambulatory 
  surgical centers; they do not include procedures that are not of a type commonly 
  performed, or that may be safely performed, in physicians' offices. Additional 
  standards address post-operative recovery, operating and recovery room space, 
  the duration of procedures, and the use of anesthesia. 
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>HCFA has proposed altering its list of ASC Procedures, 
  eliminating Medicare ambulatory surgical center facility fee reimbursement for 
  many, if not most, of the pain management procedures currently performed by 
  the Physician-Investors. <u>See</u> Update of Ratesetting Methodology, Payment 
  Rates, Payment Policies, and the List of Covered Surgical Procedures for Ambulatory 
  Surgical Centers Effective October 1, 1998, 63 Fed. Reg. 32290 (1998) (to be 
  codified at 42 C.F.R. Pts. 416, 488) (proposed June 12, 1998).

  medical practice income generated from performing ASC Procedures drops below 
  33.3% for any reason, including publication of a new HCFA list of ASC Procedures, 
  then this advisory opinion will be without force and effect. 
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions
