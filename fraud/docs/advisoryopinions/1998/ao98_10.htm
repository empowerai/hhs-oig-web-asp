<p><strong>Re: Advisory Request No. 98-10</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Dear [name redacted]: <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you asked whether the payment of a sales commission to an independent manufacturers' 
  representative (the &quot;Arrangement&quot;) constitutes grounds for sanctions 
  under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act 
  (the &quot;Act&quot;), the exclusion authority for kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) 
  of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete 
  description of the material facts regarding the Arrangement. In issuing this 
  opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information you presented to 
  us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such information. 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Arrangement could constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the 
  OIG will not subject the Arrangement, as described in the request and supplemental 
  submissions, to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to 
  sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the requestor and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. § 1008. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>I. Factual Background</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>A. The Parties</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Requestor is the sole shareholder and employee of Sales Agent A (&quot;Sales 
  Agent A&quot;), an independent manufacturers' representative. Sales Agent A 
  markets itself as a service providing &quot;negotiation of national hospital 
  agreements.&quot; Manufacturer B (&quot;Manufacturer B&quot;) is a manufacturer 
  of, among other things, disposable medical supplies. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>B. The Arrangement </strong><br>
  <br>
  In April 1997, Sales Agent A entered into a sales agency contract (the &quot;Contract&quot;) 
  with Manufacturer B.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Under the Contract, Sales 
  Agent A agreed to submit bids and negotiate contracts on behalf of Manufacturer 
  B for the sale and distribution of disposable medical supplies, including adult 
  diapers and disposable underpads, to six potential purchasers (the &quot;Purchasers&quot;).<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  Each Purchaser was either a multi-hospital health care system or a group purchasing 
  organization representing primarily hospitals and hospital systems. As compensation 
  for Sales Agent A's efforts, Manufacturer B agreed to pay Sales Agent A a monthly 
  commission of between 1% and 1.25% of invoiced amounts, the specific percentage 
  being set in advance for each Purchaser.<a
href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Sales Agent A has certified that this compensation 
  represents fair market value. Sales Agent A performed services under the Contract 
  for which it has not yet been paid. The Contract was subsequently canceled as 
  to future Sales Agent A services. <br>
  <br>
  The Contract was the only financial arrangement between Sales Agent A and Manufacturer 
  B, and Sales Agent A had no arrangements with any of the Purchasers for or involving 
  Manufacturer B products. To Sales Agent A's knowledge, Manufacturer B had no 
  financial arrangements with any of the Purchasers involving Manufacturer B products 
  covered by the Contract, other than those arrangements set forth in the contracts 
  negotiated by Sales Agent A. Sales Agent A has certified that the group purchasing 
  organization fees paid by Manufacturer B to the Purchasers that are group purchasing 
  organizations were 2% or less of sales volume, and that, to Sales Agent A's 
  knowledge, rebates offered to multi-hospital systems were allocated down to 
  each purchasing hospital and properly disclosed to the Federal health care programs. 
  Neither Sales Agent A nor Manufacturer B billed or received any payment from 
  a Federal health care program for the goods sold under the contracts Sales Agent 
  A negotiated. <br>
  <br>
  Sales Agent A's representation of Manufacturer B was limited to submitting bids 
  to and negotiating contracts with the Purchasers and making routine follow-up 
  calls to the Purchasers to resolve questions and to report and reconcile group 
  purchasing organization fees and discounts<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>earned by the Purchasers. Specific orders for goods under the Purchasers' contracts 
  were placed by the Purchasers' purchasing agents directly with Manufacturer 
  B or one of its authorized distributors. Sales Agent A interacted exclusively 
  with centralized purchasing departments of multi-hospital systems and group 
  purchasing organizations; it had no contact with individual hospitals, physicians, 
  or beneficiaries and did not contact or market to anyone in a professional position 
  to make referrals or order goods or services on behalf of individual patients. 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>II. Legal Analysis</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. <br>
  <br>
  The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose 
  of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to induce 
  further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales agents are in the business of recommending or arranging for the purchase 
  of the items or services they offer for sale on behalf of their principals, 
  typically manufacturers, or other sellers (collectively, &quot;Sellers&quot;). 
  Accordingly, any compensation arrangement between a Seller and an independent 
  sales agent for the purpose of selling health care items or services that are 
  directly or indirectly reimbursable by a Federal health care program potentially 
  implicates the anti-kickback statute, irrespective of the methodology used to 
  compensate the agent. Moreover, because such agents are independent contractors, 
  they are less accountable to the Seller than an employee. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. 
  Reg. 35952, 35981 (July 29, 1991); 54 Fed. Reg. 3088, 3093 (Jan. 23, 1989). 
  For these reasons, this Office has a longstanding concern with independent sales 
  agency arrangements. <br>
  <br>
  In some circumstances, our concerns can be addressed by structuring a sales 
  agency arrangement to fit in a safe harbor. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 56 Fed. 
  Reg. at 35974. The Department of Health and Human Services has published safe 
  harbor regulations that protect certain arrangements that might otherwise technically 
  violate the anti-kickback statute from prosecution. <u>See</u> section 1128B(b)(3) 
  of the Act; 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions 
  that, if met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned 
  for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection 
  is only afforded to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions 
  set forth in the safe harbor. The regulatory safe harbor potentially applicable 
  to the Arrangement is the personal services and management contracts safe harbor. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. §1001.952(d). The Arrangement could not qualify under this 
  safe harbor, however, since the nature of the services provided under the Contract 
  precluded an exact specification of the schedule for the performance of Sales 
  Agent A's services and a determination of Sales Agent A's total aggregate compensation 
  in advance, as required by the regulation. <br>
  <br>
  In reviewing sales arrangements that do not fit in the personal services and 
  management contracts safe harbor, this Office has identified several characteristics 
  of arrangements among Sellers, sales agents, and purchasers that appear to be 
  associated with an increased potential for program abuse, particularly overutilization 
  and excessive program costs. These suspect characteristics include, but are 
  not limited to: 
<ul>
  <li>compensation based on percentage of sales; <br>
  </li>
  <li>direct billing of a Federal health care program by the Seller for the item 
    or service sold by the sales agent; <br>
  </li>
  <li>direct contact between the sales agent and physicians in a position to order 
    items or services that are then paid for by a Federal health care program;<br>
  </li>
  <li>direct contact between the sales agent and Federal health care program beneficiaries;<br>
  </li>
  <li>use of sales agents who are health care professionals or persons in a similar 
    position to exert undue influence on purchasers or patients; or<br>
  </li>
  <li>marketing of items or services that are separately reimbursable by a Federal 
    health care program (e.g., items or services not bundled with other items 
    or services covered by a DRG payment), whether on the basis of charges or 
    costs.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive, and the absence of any of these 
  factors certainly does not mean that a sales arrangement is permissible under 
  the anti-kickback statute. However, the more factors that are present, the greater 
  the scrutiny we ordinarily will give an arrangement. Of course, in all cases 
  the statute is not violated unless the parties have the requisite intent to 
  induce referrals. <br>
  <br>
  While Sales Agent A's compensation was established as a percentage of the sales 
  made to specified accounts, none of the other factors triggering increased scrutiny 
  was present. Neither Manufacturer B nor Subsidiary B billed any payer for the 
  items being sold. There was no contact between Sales Agent A and patients or 
  physicians. Sales Agent A was not in a position to exert undue influence on 
  medical decision-making. Sales Agent A's direct contacts were with sophisticated 
  purchasers, either group purchasing organizations or the purchasing units of 
  multi-hospital systems, none of whom were in a position to order specific products 
  for individual patients. Disposable medical supplies, including adult diapers 
  and disposable underpads, are not, as a general matter, separately reimbursed 
  to hospitals by Federal health care programs. </p>
<p>Sales Agent A has certified that most of the ultimate purchasers of the products 
  were acute care hospitals. Because the particular products being sold, i.e., 
  adult diapers and disposable underpads, are generally not separately reimbursable 
  by Federal health care programs, the cost of the items furnished to inpatients 
  represents an expense to the hospitals that must be covered by the fixed DRG 
  payment. Such costs necessarily reduce the amount of profit for the hospital; 
  thus, there is little, if any, incentive to overutilize the products or to pay 
  more than necessary for the items, unless there are side agreements that confer 
  additional benefits on the hospitals.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> This 
  conclusion is consistent with Sales Agent A's certification that in 1997 its 
  sales commission from Subsidiary B was renegotiated and reduced in part because 
  Sales Agent A's customers were demanding price reductions. In such circumstances, 
  the risk of overutilization and excessive costs is largely offset by the inability 
  of the purchaser to pass on the costs of the items purchased to the Federal 
  health care programs.<a
href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
  Finally, this opinion is premised on Sales Agent A's certifications that: (i) 
  Sales Agent A had no commission-splitting or other arrangements with any Purchaser; 
  (ii) Sales Agent A had no arrangement with Manufacturer B other than the Contract; 
  (iii) to Sales Agent A's knowledge, Manufacturer B had no arrangements with 
  the Purchasers with respect to the products sold in connection with the Contract, 
  other than the rebates and group purchasing fees disclosed in the request for 
  an advisory opinion; (iv) the group purchasing fees paid by Manufacturer B were 
  2% or less of sales volume; and (v) to Sales Agent A's knowledge, discounts 
  from Manufacturer B to the Purchasers for products sold in connection with the 
  Contract were allocated down to the purchasing hospital and properly disclosed 
  to the Federal health care programs. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>III. Conclusion</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>For the above reasons, we conclude that, although the Arrangement would technically 
  fall within the prohibition of the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent 
  were present, we would not seek to impose sanctions under sections 1128(b)(7) 
  (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act for payments made under 
  the Contract, provided the compensation is fair market value as Sales Agent 
  A has certified.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> <br>

    upon, by any other individual or entity.<br>
  </li>
  <li>This advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence in any matter 
    involving an entity or individual that is not a requestor to this opinion.<br>
  </li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above. No opinion is herein expressed or implied with respect to the 
    application of any other Federal, state, or local statute, rule, regulation,

    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br>
  </li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. <br>
  <br>
  The OIG will not proceed against the requester with respect to any action that 
  is part of the Arrangement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion 
  as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and accurately 
  presented, the compensation under the Contract represented fair market value, 
  and the Arrangement in practice comports with the information provided. The 
  OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions and issues raised in this 
  advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, rescind, modify, or 
  terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion is modified 
  or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the requestor with respect to 
  any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, where all 
  of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented, where 
  the compensation under the Contract represented fair market value, and where 
  such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely, and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG. <br>

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>Specifically, the Contract is between Sales Agent A and 
  Subsidiary B, a division of Manufacturer B. </p>
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>Sales Agent A successfully negotiated contracts with 
  three of the six potential purchasers identified in the Contract. </p>
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>In 1997, Sales Agent A's sales commission from Subsidiary

<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>Manufacturer B gave hospital systems discounts in the 
  form of rebates based on sales volume. Nothing in this advisory opinion should 
  be construed as expressing an opinion as to the legality of such rebates. </p>
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions 
  related to the anti-kickback implications of the Arrangement are based on violations 
  of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory 
  opinion is the same under both. </p>
<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>The fact that some small number of ultimate purchasers

<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>We express no opinion regarding the liability of the 
  Purchasers or any other party under the False Claims Act or other legal authorities

  with products purchased pursuant to the Arrangement. </p>
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>While we are not authorized to opine on &quot;fair market 
  value,&quot; <u>see</u> section 1128D(b)(3) of the Act, we note that Sales Agent 
  A's percentage commission under the Contract was less than one-half of the 3% 
  amount established in the safe harbor for group purchasing organizations, <u>see</u> 
  42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(j), and that the amount of the sales price paid as a commission 
  to Sales Agent A and the group purchasing organizations together either equaled 
  or only slightly exceeded the 3% amount. </p>
