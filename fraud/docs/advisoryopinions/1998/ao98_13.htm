<p><strong>Advisory Opinion No. 98-13</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether an ambulance restocking program, coordinated through a local 
  emergency medical services council (the &quot;Program&quot;), constitutes prohibited 
  remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social 
  Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), and, if so, whether the Program constitutes 
  grounds for the imposition of sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 
  1128B(b) of the Act, the exclusion authority related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) 
  of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary information, is true and correct, and constitutes 
  a complete description of the material facts regarding the Program. In issuing 
  this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information you presented 
  to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such information. 
  This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts have not been 
  disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Program could constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the 
  OIG will not subject the Program, as described in the request and supplemental 
  submissions, to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to 
  sections 1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the addressees 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The requesters of this advisory opinion are eight fire departments (listed 
  on the attached distribution list) and The County X Ambulance District located 
  in County X, State Y. All of the fire departments and the ambulance district 
  are owned and operated by municipal governments and provide emergency medical 
  services (&quot;EMS&quot;). <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The requesters are members of the County X Emergency Medical Services Council 
  (the &quot;Council&quot;), a non-profit association founded in 1980. The Council 
  is an advisory and coordinating organization whose mission is to promote and 
  advance EMS throughout County X. Membership on the Council includes those who 
  are providing EMS and those who are interested in furthering the goals of the 
  Council. The Council's current membership includes public and private ambulance 
  providers, hospitals, medical directors, and local educational facilities. The 
  Council's goals include: standardization of EMS practices and equipment; provision 
  of education and training for EMS providers; and improvement of EMS capabilities 
  in the Council's service area. Through its Executive Committee, the Council 
  may appoint working committees to accomplish its goals. One such committee is 
  a practice committee. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The practice committee has oversight of the restocking Program and is responsible 
  for standardizing the Program within the local EMS community, educating Council 
  members regarding the Program, and disseminating information about the Program. 
  The Program has been in operation in County X for eighteen years. The Program 
  provides for the free exchange of drugs and medical supplies used by EMS providers 
  when they bring an individual to a hospital for emergency treatment. Currently, 
  all hospitals and EMS providers in the County X service area participate in 
  the Program. Under the Program protocol, the hospital that receives the patient 
  restocks the ambulance with the medications and supplies used in connection 
  with the patient's emergency medical treatment. Both an EMS provider and a representative 
  of the receiving hospital fill out and sign an emergency medical response for 
  each patient (the &quot;Report&quot;). One copy of the Report is placed in the 
  patient's record and one copy of the Report is used for inventory documentation 
  of the expended drugs and medical supplies. The ambulance providers are not 
  charged, and do not pay, for restocked items. The cost of the drugs and medical 
  supplies is charged to the patient by the receiving hospital in the manner of 
  other billing for the services to the patient. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; 
  transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or 
  indirectly, covertly or overtly. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>This Office's concern with the provision of goods and services for free or 
  at below-market rates to potential referral sources is longstanding and clear: 
  such arrangements are suspect under the anti-kickback statute. The provision 
  of free or below-market rate goods or services to a referral source may violate 
  the anti-kickback statute if one purpose of the gift is to induce referrals 
  of Federal health care program business. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The provision by a hospital of free supplies and medications to an ambulance 
  provider fits squarely within the meaning of remuneration for purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute. An inference may be drawn that one purpose of such remuneration 
  is to induce the ambulance provider to bring patients to the hospital. However, 
  the strength of that inference may vary with the circumstances of the specific 
  arrangement. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>In assessing the potential risk of fraud or abuse under the anti-kickback statute, 
  our concerns are principally fourfold: increased risk of overutilization, increased 
  program costs, patient freedom of choice, and unfair competition. Because it 
  is limited to emergency medical services, the Program does not increase the 
  risk of overutilization and is unlikely to lead to increased costs to Federal 
  health care programs. Neither the number of Federal program beneficiaries requiring 
  emergency transport in County X, nor the treatment these patients will require 
  or receive at a hospital, is related to the existence or operation of the Program.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>With respect to freedom of choice and unfair competition, emergency ambulance 
  crews have relatively limited opportunities to steer patients to particular 
  hospitals. In life threatening cases, the selection of a receiving hospital 
  will be dictated by the patient's condition. In other circumstances, the choice 
  of receiving hospital will frequently be dictated by the patient, the patient's 
  physician, or the patient's insurer. Notwithstanding, there will inevitably 
  be situations in which ambulance provider personnel would be able to steer patients 
  who do not have a preference to a particular facility. In the circumstances 
  presented here, however, there would appear to be no financial reason arising 
  from the Program for ambulance personnel to steer patients to a particular hospital, 
  since all area hospitals participate in the Program. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>However, the mere fact that all hospitals may be restocking ambulances without 
  charge does not immunize conduct that might otherwise violate the anti-kickback 
  statute. Some institutions may well participate in the restocking because of 
  fear of adverse competitive consequences if they do not. In short, remuneration 
  that is given to retain or maintain existing referrals may violate the anti-kickback 
  statute. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>We previously addressed an ambulance restocking arrangement that raised concerns 
  under the anti-kickback statute in OIG Advisory Opinion 97-6 (October 8, 1997). 
  Based on the specific facts presented by the hospital requester, we found that, 
  notwithstanding a state administrative regulation that required ambulances to 
  transport patients to the facility of the patient's choice except in exigent 
  circumstances, the hospital's proposed arrangement for free restocking of supplies 
  and medications posed a risk of improper steering and unfair competition. Accordingly, 
  we concluded that the arrangement could potentially violate the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The facts presented here differ in material respects from those presented in 
  OIG Advisory Opinion 97-6 for the following reasons:<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the Program is not a unilateral arrangement; rather, it is part 
  of an ongoing effort by the Council and its members to maintain and improve 
  EMS throughout the County X service area. The Council, a non-profit association 
  founded in 1980, is open to all hospitals and emergency ambulance providers 
  in the area, as well as local educational institutions, physicians, and other 
  community members. Regional EMS councils, like the one at issue here, were formed 
  in the early 1970s in response to a growing recognition of the inadequacy of 
  then existing emergency medical care and the high cost in human lives and physical 
  disabilities due to accidents and sudden illness and injury.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  EMS councils were established to coordinate emergency care among all levels 
  of a region's EMS system, including public safety organizations, private and 
  hospital-based ambulance providers, hospitals and other critical care facilities, 
  and local physicians and community groups. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><u>Second</u>, the restocking aspects of the Program are not free-standing; 
  the Program is part and parcel of a coordinated regional effort to integrate 
  and improve the emergency medical care system. In addition to the drug and supply 
  exchange programs, the Council promotes the standardization of practices and 
  equipment within the emergency medical system and provides education and training 
  for EMS providers. It also evaluates and supports requests for improvements 
  to the local EMS delivery system, sponsors educational programs related to EMS, 
  and otherwise seeks to promote high quality EMS care for the region. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><u>Third</u>, regional and local programs to improve and coordinate the delivery 
  of quality EMS have been actively encouraged and promoted by the Federal government 
  over the past twenty-five years. In 1973 the Federal government enacted the 
  Emergency Medical Services Systems Act of 1973 (&quot;EMSSA&quot;), Pub L. 93-154, 
  87 Stat. 594 (1973), which provided federal funding for the development of regional 
  EMS systems at the state, regional, and local levels.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  These regional systems were to develop comprehensive programs to improve such 
  areas as communications (including &quot;911&quot; systems); transportation; 
  provision and training of emergency personnel; facilities; critical care units; 
  use of public safety agencies; accessibility to care; consumer participation, 
  education, and information; transfer of patients; standard medical record keeping; 
  independent review and evaluation of EMS; disaster linkage; and mutual aid agreements 
  among communities. EMSSA was one of several Federal legislative efforts to promote 
  EMS delivery systems, including the Highway Safety Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-594, 
  80 Stat. 731 (1966), which established an EMS program in the Department of Transportation; 
  the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program, under the Public Health 
  Act, Pub. L. 98-555, 99 Stat. 2854 (1984), which provided funds for enhancing 
  pediatric EMS; and the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act of 1990, 
  Pub. L. 101-590, 104 Stat. 2915 (1990). <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><u>Finally</u> -- and importantly -- the Program is likely to have a positive 
  impact on the quality of patient care. By providing a mechanism to ensure that 
  ambulances are fully stocked with current medications and appropriate supplies, 
  the Program is likely to foster fast, efficient, and effective pre-hospital 
  emergency care for the County X service area. These significant community benefits, 
  coupled with the conditions, requirements, and limitations outlined above, persuade 
  us that the Program poses minimal risk of fraud and abuse under the anti-kickback 
  statute, and therefore the OIG would not subject it to sanction. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The advisory opinion process is a &quot;means of relating the anti-kickback 
  statute to the particular facts of a specific arrangement.&quot; 62 Fed. Reg. 
  7350, 7351 (February 19, 1997). The advisory opinion process permits this Office 
  to protect specific arrangements that &quot;contain[] limitations, requirements, 
  or controls that give adequate assurance that Federal health care programs cannot 
  be abused.&quot; <u>Id</u>. In evaluating an arrangement's potential to lead 
  to fraud or abuse of Federal health care programs, no one fact or element is 
  necessarily dispositive. Here, we are persuaded that the Program is likely to 
  result in substantial community benefit consistent with longstanding national 
  policy objectives. We are further persuaded that, taken as a whole, the aspects 
  of the Program described above -- including, but not limited to, the Program's 
  relationship to a coordinated regional EMS system, the role of the regional 
  Council, the Program's limitation to emergency medical services, and the uniformity 
  of the Program across providers -- create sufficient limitations, requirements, 
  or controls so as to give adequate assurance that the Program will not lead 
  to program abuse under the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we conclude that while the Program might technically violate the 
  anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, 
  the OIG will not impose sanctions on the requesters under sections 1128(b)(7) 
  (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, based on the facts certified 
  in the requesters' request for an advisory opinion. <br>
