<p>[Issued November 3, 1998] 
<p>[Name and address redacted] 
<p><strong>Re: Advisory Opinion No. 98-16</strong> 
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether a proposed arrangement under which [Name redacted] would assign 
  an employee pharmacist to work in designated hospital transplant centers for 
  the purpose of providing pharmacy-related products and services (the "Proposed 
  Arrangement") would constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), and, if so, 
  whether the Proposed Arrangement would constitute grounds for the imposition 
  of sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the 
  exclusion authority related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or 
  the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary information, is true and correct and constitutes 
  a complete description of the material facts regarding the Proposed Arrangement. 
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  you presented to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of 
  such information. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Arrangement may constitute prohibited remuneration under section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Requestor</strong> 
<p>[Name redacted] (the "Pharmacy"), is a mail-order pharmacy, wholly owned by 
  [Name redacted]. The Pharmacy specializes in supplying medications and pharmaceuticals 
  to organ transplant recipients. The Pharmacy offers a number of services, including 
  express medication delivery, medication counseling, and direct insurance billing. 
<p><strong>B. Organ Transplantation</strong> 
<p>Organ transplantation involves the surgical replacement of a failed organ. 
  In order to prevent rejection of the organ, transplant patients require life-long 
  immunosuppressive drug therapy. The drug therapy begins immediately after transplantation 
  and involves a plan of treatment developed by a team of clinicians, including 
  a pharmacist. Federal health care programs provide drug coverage for this immunosuppressive 
  therapy. Medicare provides a maximum of thirty-six months of coverage for immunosuppressive 
  therapy after a transplant (<u>see</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(s)(2)(J)), and 
  state Medicaid programs cover immunosuppressive drug therapy under their outpatient 
  drug benefits (<u>see</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396d). 
<p>Approximately 275 hospitals perform organ transplantation in this country. 
  In order to be eligible for Medicare reimbursement, these hospitals are required 
  to meet conditions of Medicare participation. Relevant to this opinion are the 
  conditions applicable to pharmacy management (42 C.F.R.&#167; 482.25) and discharge 
  planning (42 C.F.R. &#167; 482.43). These regulatory standards require hospitals 
  to provide or furnish qualified personnel and quality pharmaceutical services, 
  either directly or through contractual arrangements, and to have in effect a 
  discharge planning process that applies to all patients. 
<p><strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Through employee services agreements, the Pharmacy proposes placing a licensed 
  pharmacist in hospital transplant centers (the "Centers") interested in the 
  Pharmacy's services. The Pharmacy would employ the pharmacist and would be responsible 
  for all employee costs, such as wages, benefits, and taxes. To fill the pharmacist 
  position, the Pharmacy may offer the position to current or former employees 
  or independent contractors of a Center. 
<p>The pharmacist's duties would include: working with transplant teams to facilitate 
  the patient's post-transplant care; preparing pharmaceutical care plans; overseeing 
  patient compliance with pharmaceutical care plans after discharge; securing 
  the patient's insurance coverage for pharmaceuticals and services provided by 
  the Pharmacy; and processing prescriptions through the Pharmacy's pharmaceutical 
  distribution center. The pharmacist would also perform all billing and collections 
  for Pharmacy services. These items and services may be paid in whole or in part 
  by a Federal health care program. 
<p>The Centers would incur no cost under the Proposed Arrangement, but would be 
  responsible for providing the pharmacists with a work area and access to their 
  patients. The Centers could submit recommendations for the on-site pharmacist 
  position and could rehire any former employee hired and subsequently terminated 
  by the Pharmacy. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p><strong>A. Law</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has published safe harbor regulations 
  that define practices that are not subject to the anti-kickback statute because 
  such practices would unlikely result in fraud or abuse. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
  &#167; 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, if met, 
  assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the arrangement 
  qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection is only afforded 
  to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions set forth in 
  the safe harbor. The regulatory safe harbor potentially applicable to the Proposed 
  Arrangement is the personal services and management contracts safe harbor. <u>See</u> 
  42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d). The Proposed Arrangement does not qualify under 
  this safe harbor, however, since there is no compensation paid by the Centers 
  to the Pharmacy, despite the fact that at least some of the services will have 
  value to the Centers, which are obligated to provide them in accordance with 
  the Health Care Financing Administration's ("HCFA") conditions of participation. 
  The personal services safe harbor requires that the compensation paid for services 
  be set at fair market value in arms-length transactions. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
  &#167; 1001.952(d)(5). 
<p><strong>B. Prior Guidance</strong> 
<p>The OIG has stated on numerous occasions its view that the provision of free 
  goods or services to an actual or potential referral source may violate the 
  anti-kickback statute, depending on the circumstances. For example, in the preamble 
  to the 1991 safe harbor regulations, we stated that giving free goods that have 
  an independent value to a physician may violate the anti-kickback statute. <u>See</u> 
  56 Fed. Reg. 35978 (July 29, 1991). The OIG has also issued a Special Fraud 
  Alert relating to the provision of free services by a clinical laboratory phlebotomist 
  placed in a physician's office: 
<p>"While the mere placement of a laboratory employee in the physician's office 
  would not necessarily serve as an inducement prohibited by the anti-kickback 
  statute, the statute is implicated when the phlebotomist performs additional 
  tasks that are not normally the responsibility of the physician's office staff. 
  These tasks can include taking vital signs or other nursing functions, testing 
  for the physician's office laboratory, or performing clerical services. 
<p>Where the phlebotomist performs clerical or medical functions not directly 
  related to the collection or processing of laboratory specimens, a strong inference 
  arises that he or she is providing a benefit in return for the physician's referrals 
  to the laboratory. In such a case, the physician, the phlebotomist, and the 
  laboratory may have exposure under the anti-kickback statute. This analysis 
  applies equally to the placement of phlebotomists in other health care settings, 
  including nursing homes, clinics, and hospitals." 
<p>59 Fed. Reg. 65372, 65377 (Dec. 19, 1994). This analysis generally applies 
  to the provision of any free or below market rate goods or services to actual 
  or potential referral sources. If the intent of providing free goods or services 
  is to induce or reward referrals of Federal health care program business, the 
  anti-kickback statute would be violated. 
<p><strong>C. Analysis of the Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Our concern under the anti-kickback statute is whether the Pharmacy would be 
  giving a Center something of value in order to induce referrals of business 
  reimbursed by a Federal health care program. This Office has a longstanding 
  antipathy to arrangements where a party gives an existing or potential referral 
  source valuable services or goods for free or below fair market value. In such 
  cases, an inference arises that one purpose of the arrangement is to induce 
  or reward referrals. The Proposed Arrangement has all the hallmarks of such 
  disfavored arrangements. 
<p>First, the provision of a transplant pharmacist to a Center at no cost is a 
  tangible benefit to the Center. Prior to entering into the Proposed Arrangement, 
  a Center will have been providing at least some of the same pharmacy and discharge 
  planning services to its transplant patients, including outpatients; such services 
  are required as conditions of participation for hospitals in the Medicare program. 
  It is likely that some services provided by the Pharmacy's pharmacist will substitute 
  for services currently provided by a Center at its expense and for which it 
  will be receiving indirect reimbursement through its DRG payments. In such circumstances, 
  there would be a financial benefit to the Center. 
<p>This conclusion is supported by materials submitted by the Pharmacy. First, 
  an advertisement for a similar arrangement promoted by a pharmacy competitor 
  promises Centers savings in costly staff positions and relief of burdens imposed 
  on existing staff. Second, the contract for the Proposed Arrangement specifically 
  permits: (i) the Centers to submit recommendations for the on-site pharmacist 
  position to the Pharmacy; (ii) the Pharmacy to offer employment to current or 
  former employees or independent contractors of the Center; and (iii) the Centers 
  to rehire any former employee terminated by the Pharmacy. In effect, the Proposed 
  Arrangement offers Centers the opportunity to shift payroll or contractual costs 
  to the Pharmacy. 
<p>Second, we infer that one purpose of the free services is to induce referrals. 
  Such inference is appropriate with respect to the Proposed Arrangement for the 
  following reasons: 
<ul>
  <li>The services will be offered to a party that is in a position to influence 
    substantially the initial recommendation of a pharmacy to patients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Transplant patients need lifetime pharmacy services.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>The services required by the patients are extremely expensive and will generate 
    significant revenue for the Pharmacy. The cost of anti-rejection drugs and 
    other medications can easily exceed $10,000 per year.</li>
  <li>Immunosuppresive therapy is critical to the success of a transplant. Depending 
    on risk factors and therapy, a significant number of transplant recipients 
    undergo one or more episodes of rejection during the year immediately following 
    transplantation. Common sense suggests that a Center's recommendation of a 
    preferred outpatient pharmacy to a patient will be given great weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the Centers will exercise substantial influence over a significant 
  source of revenue for the Pharmacy. 
<p>One purpose of the anti-kickback statute is to protect patients from inappropriate 
  medical referrals by providers who may be unduly influenced by financial incentives. 
  The statute seeks to ensure that referrals will be based on sound medical judgment 
  and that providers will compete for business based on quality and convenience, 
  instead of paying for it. Given the significance of the outpatient pharmacy 
  to the transplant patient, any arrangement that might influence medical judgment 
  in recommending a particular pharmacy provider is problematic and must be closely 
  scrutinized. The Proposed Arrangement contains no safeguards, conditions, or 
  controls that mitigate the risk of improper patient steering by Centers improperly 
  influenced by the provision of free services.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p>We recognize that close coordination between a transplant center and outpatient 
  pharmacies is desirable and may significantly benefit patients, their families, 
  and their caretakers by improving quality of care and by facilitating patient 
  access to appropriate pharmaceutical supervision in a highly specialized area. 
  HCFA has recognized the value of such services and has made providing them conditions 
  of participation for purposes of Medicare reimbursement. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 
  42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 482.25, .43. A transplant center may provide these services 
  for patients in collaboration with pharmacies or others; however, they may not 
  do so in a manner that provides financial incentives for referrals. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>Based on the facts presented, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement might 
  constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, and thus the Pharmacy may potentially 
  be subject to sanction under sections 1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), and 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

  <br>
<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. Some transplant pharmacies may have special arrangements with particular 
  drug manufacturers or even be affiliated with a drug manufacturer that has products 
  in the immunosuppression market. We would have significant additional concerns 
  with such arrangements. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. We express no opinion regarding the liability of the requester or any other 
  party under the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper 
  billing, claims submission, or other conduct in connection with the services 
  and products provided under the Proposed Arrangement. </body>
