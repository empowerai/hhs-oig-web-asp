<p><strong>Re: [names redacted]</strong> 
<p><strong>OIG Advisory Opinion No. 98-19</strong> 
<p>Gentlemen: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you asked whether an arrangement whereby an independent physician association 
  would acquire an equity interest in a managed care organization would constitute 
  grounds for the imposition of sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 
  1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), the exclusion authority for 
  kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision 
  for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>In accordance with our regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 1008, your request for 
  an advisory opinion disclosed a number of additional arrangements involving 
  Company A ("Company A"), about which no opinion has been sought. For purposes 
  of this advisory opinion, the term "Proposed Arrangement" collectively includes 
  only the following arrangements described in your request for an advisory opinion 
  and supplemental submissions (as described in greater detail below): the acquisition 
  by Company B (the "IPA") of a [less than 15 percent] equity interest in Company 
  A and the consequent return on the equity investment; the assignment of physician 
  services agreements as consideration for Company A's equity investment; the 
  Network Service Agreement; the Administrative Service Agreement; and the Incentive 
  Stock Plan. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information provided in your request, including 
  all supplementary materials, is true and correct and constitutes a complete 
  description of the material facts regarding the Proposed Arrangement. In issuing 
  this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information you presented 
  to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such information. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion and supplemental 
  submissions, we conclude that the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not 
  subject the Proposed Arrangement to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, provided 
  that all compensation in connection with the Proposed Arrangement is fair market 
  value as you have certified. We express no opinion about the Medical Management 
  Program Agreement (or any agreement entered into in accordance with its terms) 
  or about any arrangement disclosed or referenced in your request letter or supplemental 
  submissions other than the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Requesters<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  of this advisory opinion and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below 
  and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> 
<p><strong>1. The Managed Care Organization</strong> 
<p>Company A is a managed care organization organized pursuant to the laws of 
  the state of Y. Company A traces its corporate roots to the early 1980s, when 
  a group of local hospitals formed a preferred provider organization ("PPO"). 
  Several years ago, the preferred provider organization merged with a licensed 
  health maintenance organization ("HMO") in an effort to develop HMO capabilities. 
  Company A was formed as the holding company for the PPO and HMO as part of the 
  merger transaction. <br>
  <br>
<p>Company A currently has eight shareholders, each of which is either a hospital, 
  the owner of a hospital facility, or a related entity of a hospital located 
  in the City X metropolitan area (collectively, the "Shareholder Hospitals"). 
  Company A is the parent company of four wholly-owned subsidiaries. The two subsidiaries 
  relevant to the Proposed Arrangement are Company C, a preferred provider organization 
  ("Company C" or the "P.O.") incorporated in State Y, and Company D, a health 
  maintenance organization domiciled in the State of Y and authorized to do business 
  in State Y and State Z ("Company D" or the "HMO").<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p>As a preferred provider organization, the P.O. contracts with various physicians 
  and hospitals in the City X metropolitan area in order to form a network of 
  providers that may be utilized by various third-party payers in offering covered 
  health care services to their subscribers. For its services in establishing 
  and maintaining the network, the P.O. receives a fee from each of its network 
  hospitals, including the Shareholder Hospitals;<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  the fee varies in direct proportion to the amount of revenue each hospital earns 
  as a result of its participation in the P.O.'s P.O. network.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p>The P.O. contracts with third-party payers (typically employers or other entities 
  in the commercial group health insurance market), who pay a negotiated fee to 
  the P.O. for access to the PPO network. As part of its services, the P.O. assists 
  the third-party payers in establishing the discounted rates they will pay network 
  providers for covered health care services. The third-party payers set and collect 
  their own subscriber premiums. There are no Medicaid enrollees in the P.O.'s 
  P.O. product lines, but there may be some Medicare enrollees. The PPO lines 
  of business currently constitute approximately [ ]% of Company A's business. 
<p>The HMO -- Company A's HMO subsidiary -- offers its own plans directly to subscribers 
  in the City X metropolitan area. These plans include non-governmental sponsored 
  plans and a Medicare risk contract. The HMO also participates in the State Y 
  and State Z Medicaid managed care programs. Unlike the P.O., the HMO receives 
  no access fees from its network providers or from third-party payers. The HMO 
  charges and receives premiums directly from contracting subscribers or receives 
  capitation payments from Medicare or Medicaid. 
<p>The HMO pays its network hospitals and physicians in accordance with negotiated 
  provider contracts. Some hospitals are paid on a per diem basis, while others 
  are paid under a full or modified risk arrangement. Primary care physicians 
  are generally paid a capitated amount per subscriber who selects the physician, 
  while specialists are paid on a discounted fee-for-service basis. The amount 
  to be paid to a physician for services, whether a capitation or fee-for-service 
  amount, will be fixed by the HMO in advance. 
<p>The substantial majority of the P.O. and the HMO business is derived from the 
  commercial group health insurance market, including virtually all of the PPO 
  business.. 
<p><strong>2. The Independent Physician Association</strong> 
<p>The IPA ("Company B" or the "IPA") is a State Y corporation established in 
  1984 and organized as an independent physician association. Its approximately 
  2200 shareholders are primary care and specialty care physicians, all of whom 
  practice in the City X metropolitan area. Profit distributions are made to the 
  IPA's shareholders based on their IPA share ownership, which has no relationship 
  to any past, present, or future referrals to Company A. Currently, each physician-shareholder 
  has a single share in the IPA; pursuant to the proposed Incentive Stock Plan 
  described below, future shareholdings will be based, in part, on physician performance 
  on a number of pre-set quality indicators and performance standards. 
<p>The IPA enters into physician service agreements ("PSAs")<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  with its shareholder physicians and with non-shareholder physicians and contracts 
  with health plans on behalf of its physician panel. The IPA physicians, along 
  with other physicians in outlying areas, serve as network providers for Company 
  A health plans, as well as for competing health plans. The IPA physicians admit 
  patients to hospitals in the Company A health plan networks, including the Shareholder 
  Hospitals. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement </strong> 
<p>Company A seeks to expand its HMO business in the City X metropolitan area. 
  To facilitate this expansion, Company A desires to ensure a stable and sufficient 
  network of physicians for the additional HMO business. Accordingly, Company 
  A proposes selling a [less than 15 percent] interest in Company A to the IPA 
  and entering into certain ancillary agreements with the IPA, as described below. 
<p><strong>1. The Stock Purchase</strong> <strong>and the Assignment Agreement</strong> 
<p>Pursuant to a subscription agreement and a shareholder agreement, the IPA will 
  purchase shares of Company A stock equal to a [less than 15 percent] equity 
  interest. The shares would constitute a separate class of non-voting stock (Class 
  B shares) with the right to elect no less than one Company A board member. Both 
  the Shareholder Hospitals and the IPA will have made substantial investments 
  in Company A, and the distribution of profits will be in direct proportion to 
  the fair market value of such investments. 
<p>As consideration for the stock, the IPA will assign to Company A the IPA's 
  contract rights under certain long-term PSAs with its shareholder (and potentially 
  some non-shareholder) physicians. Specifically, the IPA will assign PSAs for 
  no less than [ ]% of its existing primary care physicians and [ ]% of its specialty 
  physicians. The exact percentages of assigned PSAs will be fixed prior to the 
  stock transfer. The Requesters have certified that the Proposed Arrangement 
  will not be consummated unless the aggregate value of the assigned PSA contract 
  rights is fair market value for the Company A stock based on an arms-length 
  transaction and not based on the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise 
  generated between the parties. 
<p>In connection with the stock transfer, the IPA will become the exclusive physician 
  provider panel for all managed care arrangements in which Company A participates 
  (including the P.O. and the HMO plans) and will agree not to serve as a provider 
  panel for any other health care entity. Individual IPA physicians, however, 
  will be permitted to serve on panels for other health plans, subject to certain 
  limitations applicable to physicians with significant ownership or control interests 
  in a competing health care plan. 
<p>The Requesters have certified that there will be no financial arrangements 
  or intentional efforts by Company A or any of its health care plans to have 
  IPA physicians enroll persons in any of the Company A health care plans or to 
  have IPA physicians encourage persons to enroll in any of the Company A plans. 
<p><strong>2. The Ancillary Agreements</strong> 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement includes three ancillary personal services agreements 
  between the IPA and Company A: a Network Service Agreement, a Medical Management 
  Program Agreement, and an Administrative Services Agreement. 
<p>The <strong>Network Service Agreement</strong> is intended to ensure that Company 
  A health plans have sufficiently large panels of available physicians to meet 
  subscriber demand. Pursuant to the Network Service Agreement, the IPA will be 
  responsible for developing and maintaining the provider network for the Company 
  A plans for a term of ten years. It will fulfill these obligations by entering 
  into PSAs with primary and specialty care physicians. Company A will pay the 
  IPA an annual fee for access to the IPA's network of physicians and for maintenance 
  of the network. The fee will be set at $[ ] per covered employee in the PPO 
  health plans per year, with a minimum payment of $[ ] per year and a maximum 
  of $[ ] per year for the first five years. The Requesters have certified that 
  compensation to be paid under the Network Service Agreement will be consistent 
  with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be determined 
  in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or 
  business otherwise generated between the parties. 
<p>The IPA and Company A will also enter into a ten-year <strong>Medical Management 
  Program Agreement</strong>, pursuant to which the IPA shareholder physicians 
  will develop and implement various programs for Company A health plans, including, 
  but not limited to, programs in the areas of credentialing, utilization management, 
  quality improvement, and case management. The IPA and Company A will negotiate 
  separately the scope of services and specific compensation for each medical 
  program developed under the Medical Management Program Agreement. 
<p>The Medical Management Program Agreement is, in essence, an agreement to enter 
  into an undetermined number of future consulting contracts. Pursuant to the 
  Medical Management Program Agreement, each of these future contracts will provide 
  for "fair and reasonable" compensation in accordance with pre-set guidelines 
  that establish the following principles: 
<ul>
  <li>the nature, scope, and duration of services shall be agreed upon before 
    the amount of compensation is established;</li>
  <li>the compensation shall be established at fair market value rates based upon 
    the level of experience, education, or professional qualifications deemed 
    necessary to carry out the services;</li>
  <li>the services will not exceed the level of services necessary and reasonable 
    to fulfill the business purpose of the arrangement;</li>
  <li>the compensation, duties, and obligations of the parties shall be set forth 
    in writing;</li>
  <li>the compensation shall be established for no less than one year and shall 
    not be based upon, or related to, the value or volume of any referrals to 
    any physicians being compensated by the IPA to participate in any medical 
    management program established pursuant to the Medical Management Program 
    Agreement, or based on any other business relationship between the IPA and 
    Company A; and</li>
  <li>the compensation and services shall not involve the counseling or promotion 
    of a business arrangement or other activity that violates any state or Federal 
    law.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Requesters have certified that all compensation to be paid under the future 
  contracts will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions 
  and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or 
  value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties. 
<p>Finally, the IPA and Company A will enter into a ten-year <strong>Administrative 
  Services Agreement</strong>, pursuant to which Company A will provide the IPA 
  with certain administrative services, such as credentialing, accounting and 
  auditing, utilization and quality management, and office administration. The 
  IPA will pay Company A a predetermined rate, which will initially be an annual 
  fee of $[ ] per physician with an executed PSA. The Requesters have certified 
  that compensation to be paid under the Administrative Services Agreement will 
  be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not 
  be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any 
  referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties. 
<p><strong>3. The IPA Incentive Stock Plan</strong> 
<p>In accordance with its proposed shareholder agreement with Company A and to 
  provide its shareholder physicians with a personal investment in the success 
  of Company A, the IPA will offer additional shares of stock to those of its 
  shareholder physicians who agree to assume certain levels of financial risk 
  (the "Incentive Stock Plan"). Benefits under the Incentive Stock Plan are tied 
  to physician acceptance of risk, HMO participation, and quality of service, 
  and will vary depending on the degree of a physician's participation in systems 
  of care that have assumed financial risk and responsibility for provision of 
  medical services to the HMO subscribers. The Requesters estimate that approximately 
  90% of the IPA physicians will be eligible to participate in the Incentive Stock 
  Plan. 
<p>Shareholder physicians who choose to participate in the Incentive Stock Plan 
  will be required to have entered into a PSA with for a term of at least five 
  years.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> These PSAs will establish certain rights 
  and restrictions, including the following: (i) the physician will be permitted 
  to contract with any other payer and/or health system; (ii) the physician will 
  be required to have active medical staff privileges at a Company A affiliated 
  hospital; (iii) the physician will not be permitted to be employed by, or have 
  "prohibited affiliations"<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> with, a medical 
  group that is owned by a health system or managed care plan that competes with 
  Company A or the Company A health plans; (iv) subject to Company A approval 
  based on product or plan needs, the physician will be required to participate 
  in all Company A health plans; and (v) the physician's ability to transfer shares 
  in the IPA will be restricted.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> The PSAs will 
  require physicians to comply with the health plans' quality improvement and 
  utilization management programs. 
<p><strong>4. Payments for Provider Services</strong> 
<p>The IPA physician shareholders and the Shareholder Hospitals will receive reimbursement 
  from the HMO and from the PPO third-party payers for health care services they 
  provide. The Requesters have certified that the remuneration paid to physicians 
  and hospitals for services provided to the PPO or the HMO subscribers will represent 
  fair market value in an arms-length transaction for the services the physicians 
  or hospitals provide and will not take into account the volume or value of referrals 
  or other business generated between the parties. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Law</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
<p>The Department has published safe harbor regulations that protect certain arrangements 
  that might otherwise technically violate the anti-kickback statute from prosecution. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions 
  that, if met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned 
  for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection 
  is only afforded to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions 
  set forth in the safe harbor. Notwithstanding, arrangements that do not fit 
  squarely within a safe harbor do not necessarily violate the anti-kickback statute. 
  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 56 Fed. Reg. 35952, 35954 (July 29, 1991). 
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p><strong>1. The Stock Purchase and Assignment Agreements</strong> 
<p>Although the Proposed Arrangement involves a complex web of contracts, the 
  basic business transaction is straightforward: the IPA is purchasing an equity 
  interest in Company A in exchange for its physicians' long term commitment to 
  serve as the exclusive provider panel and provide medical management services 
  for the Company A health plans. In other words, the Shareholder Hospitals and 
  the IPA are joint venturing in a managed care organization. Accordingly, we 
  start by applying a joint venture analysis to the Proposed Arrangement. <br>
  <br>
<p>Health care joint ventures in which investors are also sources of referrals 
  or suppliers of items or services to the joint venture raise many questions 
  under the anti-kickback statute. In 1989, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert 
  specifically discussing joint venture arrangements that may violate the anti-kickback 
  statute. In general, joint ventures between physicians and hospitals in which 
  they practice may be suspect, because distributions from the joint ventures 
  may be disguised remuneration paid in return for referrals. Like any kickback 
  scheme, these arrangements can lead to overutilization of services, increased 
  costs for Federal health care programs, corruption of professional judgment, 
  and unfair competition. 
<p><strong>a. The Proposed Arrangement Does Not Fit the Safe Harbor for Investment 
  Interests in Small Entities</strong> 
<p>The safe harbor for investments in small entities, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(a)(2), 
  has eight elements, each of which must be satisfied in order for an arrangement 
  to qualify for the exception. The eight elements address three areas of concern 
  in abusive joint ventures: (i) how investors are selected and retained; (ii) 
  the nature of the business structure; and (iii) the financing and profit distributions. 
  Although the Requesters have certified that the IPA's assignment of the PSAs 
  will represent fair market value for the equity interest, the stock purchase 
  arrangement fails to meet several of the elements of the safe harbor; in particular, 
  all of the proposed investors will be furnishing items or services to Company 
  A health plans, and the investment opportunity is only being offered to the 
  IPA shareholders. 
<p><strong>b. The Proposed Arrangement Potentially Violates the Anti-Kickback 
  Statute</strong> 
<p>The initial question to be addressed is whether equity ownership in a managed 
  care organization by an independent physician association may provide physicians 
  with remuneration for referrals of their patients to the managed care organization. 
  This Office has recognized that Congress did not intend the anti-kickback statute 
  to bar all forms of investment or ownership in health care providers by referral 
  sources. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 54 Fed. Reg. 3090 (Jan. 1, 1989). Recent legislation 
  permitting provider-sponsored organizations to enter into Medicare + Choice 
  contracts reflects an implicit determination by Congress that physician-hospital 
  ownership of managed care organizations is acceptable, provided such organizations 
  comply with all relevant statutory and regulatory authorities, including the 
  anti-kickback statute. The literal language of the anti-kickback statute encompasses 
  any knowing or willful payment to a physician to induce the physician to recommend 
  a health plan pursuant to which services are reimbursed by a Federal health 
  care program. For example, payments to physicians by a health plan for marketing 
  the plan clearly implicate the statute. 
<p>With respect to joint ventures, the major concern is that the profit distributions 
  to investors in the joint venture that are also referral sources to the joint 
  venture may potentially represent remuneration for those referrals. A related 
  concern is that, where the investing parties have a referral relationship wholly 
  apart from the joint venture, distributions from the joint venture could potentially 
  represent remuneration to one party for referrals to the other party based on 
  those independent relationships. In either case, the remuneration could result 
  in increased utilization of services or increased costs to Federal health care 
  programs. Accordingly, all aspects of all relationships between the parties 
  must be examined. 
<p><strong> c. Distributions from Company A to the IPA Are Unlikely to Constitute 
  Remuneration for Referrals</strong> <strong>to Company A</strong> 
<p>Our initial inquiry is whether the distributions from the joint venture may 
  be "disguised" remuneration to the IPA physician-shareholders for referrals 
  of their patients to the joint venture. In other words, do the IPA's physician-shareholders 
  refer patients to Company A's health plans and, if so, do the physicians receive 
  remuneration for those referrals either directly or indirectly? For purposes 
  of this opinion, we are addressing only the potential return on the IPA's equity 
  investment in Company A, in the absence, as certified by the Requesters, of 
  any financial arrangement or intentional effort by Company A or any of the Company 
  A health care plans to have physicians enroll persons in the Company A plans 
  or to have physicians encourage persons to enroll in the Company A plans. 
<p>On the threshhold issue of whether a physician's recommendation of a particular 
  health plan to a patient would potential implicate the anti-kickback statute, 
  we recognize that in many instances a physician's ability to influence a patient's 
  enrollment in Company A's HMO or PPO products may be limited. Unlike the referrals 
  in many illegal joint venture arrangements, in which a physician's order almost 
  always results in the delivery of the item or service ordered, a physician's 
  recommendation of a health plan is only one of many factors that may influence 
  a person's choice of an insurance plan. For example, other considerations may 
  include (i) whether a plan is available under a patient's employer plan; (ii) 
  the benefit package in light of the patient and other family member needs; (iii) 
  premium and other costs; (iv) recommendations from other family members' physicians; 
  and (v) other health plans in which the physician participates.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
<p>With respect to Company A, most of its business is in the group health insurance 
  market, including virtually all of its PPO business. In the group market, employers 
  or other sponsors select the plans, and price is usually the most important 
  consideration. With respect to such group business, a physician's ability to 
  influence significantly plan revenues through enrollment recommendations is 
  marginal. Accordingly, in the absence of any specific marketing efforts by the 
  IPA's physician-shareholders to promote enrollment in Company A's group HMO 
  and PPO plans, we do not think it likely that their recommendations, if any, 
  would result in appreciable revenues to Company A. 
<p>With respect to individual enrollment in Company A's Medicare and Medicaid 
  risk contracts, we believe a physician's recommendation may carry more weight. 
  Accordingly, the second focus of our inquiry is to determine whether, assuming 
  that a physician successfully recommends a Company D HMO to a patient, the possible 
  return on the IPA's investment in Company A would constitute direct or indirect 
  remuneration to the referring physician. Historically in most suspect joint 
  ventures, there are relatively direct connections between the referral, the 
  generation of a fee, the consequent profit to the joint venture, and the return 
  to the referral source as dividends or otherwise. By contrast, HMOs assume significant 
  financial risk by agreeing to provide comprehensive coverage to enrollees for 
  a fixed price over a fixed period of time. Profitability depends on successful 
  management of the risk and not simply on the delivery of medical services. In 
  managed care, physician or provider support, or even high enrollment, is not 
  sufficient to guarantee success, as demonstrated by the recent failures of a 
  number of provider-owned managed care entities. 
<p>Certain characteristics of the IPA provide further assurance that any distributions 
  to the IPA's shareholder-physicians are unlikely to constitute prohibited remuneration 
  for referrals. The IPA is a pre-existing and functioning entity that has not 
  been formed for the purpose of entering into the Proposed Arrangement. Moreover, 
  ownership in the IPA presently is based on a <em>per capita</em>share distribution; 
  under the Incentive Stock Plan, future shareholdings will be based, in part, 
  on physician assumption of risk and performance on a number of pre-set quality 
  and performance standards, but not on referrals to Company A plans. Given these 
  factors, the interposition of the IPA as the equity owner in Company A will 
  further dilute any potential financial nexus between a physician's recommendation 
  to a patient of a Company A plan and his or her return on the Company A investment. 
  Simply put, any distribution from Company A will go to the IPA, not the physician, 
  and will be proportional to the IPA's share of the total investment in Company 
  A. To the extent the IPA's board distributes any monies received from Company 
  A to the IPA's shareholders, that distribution will be based on the shareholders' 
  share ownership in the IPA, which has no relationship to any past, present, 
  or future referrals to Company A. 
<p>Finally, assuming that physicians can influence the selection of an HMO, the 
  Proposed Arrangement is unlikely to result in increased costs to Federal health 
  care programs or overutilization of services, since the Company D HMO plans 
  provide services on a capitated basis, discouraging unnecessary services. <br>
  <br>
<p>In sum, in the circumstances presented here, these factors -- the limited ability 
  of physician-shareholders in the IPA to influence referrals to Company A health 
  plans or to generate revenues through recommending Company A health plans, the 
  interposition of an investor that is a pre-existing and functioning entity with 
  a stock distribution structure unrelated to referrals to the investment entity, 
  and the minimal risk of increased program costs -- significantly reduce the 
  likelihood that the Proposed Arrangement will result in unlawful remuneration 
  for referrals. 
<p><strong> d. Prohibited Remuneration for Referrals Outside of Joint Venture 
  Is Unlikely</strong> 
<p>The Shareholder Hospitals may derive a substantial amount of revenue from patients 
  referred to them by the IPA physicians wholly apart from any Company A-related 
  business. This raises the possibility that the joint venture may be a vehicle 
  by which the hospitals may indirectly reward the physicians for revenues the 
  hospitals receive as a result of the physicians' referrals of fee-for-service 
  patients to the hospitals. 
<p>In determining whether the joint venture may be a vehicle for illegally remunerating 
  one investor for referrals to another investor, we examine initially whether 
  the party making the referrals receives a disproportionate return on its investment 
  compared to the return on the investment of the party receiving the referrals. 
  Any excess or disproportionate return on the investment may be remuneration 
  for referrals. Based on the facts and circumstances as represented by the Requesters, 
  all equity owners in Company A will have made substantial investments in the 
  venture and distribution of profits will be in direct proportion to the fair 
  market value of such investments. Thus, all investors' returns on investment 
  will be commensurate with their undertakings; the IPA's return will not include 
  any "unearned" remuneration to the IPA or its physician-shareholders attributable 
  to their referrals to the Shareholder Hospitals. Accordingly, any profit distributions 
  from Company A would not represent compensation to physicians for their referrals 
  to the hospitals. 
<p>However, even in situations where each party's return is proportionate with 
  its investment, the mere opportunity to invest (and consequently receive profit 
  distributions) may in certain circumstances constitute illegal remuneration 
  if offered in exchange for past or future referrals. Such situations may include 
  arrangements where one or several investors in a joint venture control a sufficiently 
  large stream of referrals to make the venture's financial success highly likely, 
  or where one investor has an established track record with similar ventures 
  or the financial investment required is so small that the investors have little 
  or no real risk. By contrast, here there are no such indicia that the Proposed 
  Arrangement will generate any profits for its investors, since the managed care 
  industry is highly competitive. Nor are there any indicia that the physicians 
  control a stream of referrals to the managed care joint venture. In light of 
  the substantial financial investment being made by the IPA, the mere opportunity 
  to participate as an investor in Company A is unlikely to constitute remuneration 
  for referrals from the IPA or the IPA's physicians to the Shareholder Hospitals. 
<p><strong>2. The Ancillary Contractual Arrangements</strong> 
<p>In addition to the stock purchase and assignment agreements that effectuate 
  the joint venture, there will be a number of ancillary agreements that obligate 
  the parties in connection with the joint venture and therefore must be considered. 
<p><strong>a. The Network Service Agreement</strong> 
<p>The first ancillary agreement is the ten-year Network Service Agreement, pursuant 
  to which the IPA will become the exclusive provider of professional health care 
  services for all managed care arrangements in which Company A participates and 
  will develop and maintain Company A's provider networks during the term of the 
  agreement. As consideration for the IPA's services, Company A will pay the IPA 
  an annual fee of $[ ] per covered employee in Company A's preferred provider 
  programs. For the first five years, the fee will be no less than$[ ] and no 
  more than$[ ]. The Network Service Agreement will be a full-time agreement. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>The safe harbor potentially relevant to the Network Service Agreement is the 
  personal services and management contracts safe harbor, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d), 
  which protects certain arrangements that comply with the following conditions: 
<ul>
  <li>the agreement is in writing and signed by the parties;</li>
  <li>the agreement specifies the services to be provided;</li>
  <li>if the agreement is intended to be for services on a periodic, sporadic, 
    or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, 
    the agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise 
    length, and the exact charge for such intervals;</li>
  <li>the term of the agreement is for not less than one year;</li>
  <li>the aggregate compensation paid over the term of the agreement is set in 
    advance, is consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions 
    and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value 
    of any referrals or business generated between the parties for which payment 
    may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program; 
    and</li>
  <li>the services performed under the agreement do not involve the counseling 
    or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity that violates any 
    State or Federal law.</li>
</ul>
<p>42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d). 
<p>The Network Service Agreement does not fit into the personal services safe 
  harbor because the aggregate compensation to be paid over the term of the agreement 
  is not set out in advance, as required by the regulation. However, the Requesters 
  have certified that the IPA's compensation will represent fair market value 
  in an arms-length transaction for the services to be rendered by the IPA and 
  will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value 
  of business generated between the parties. Moreover, the methodology to be used 
  to determine the amount of the compensation -- $[ ] per covered PPO employee 
  -- will be established in advance for the term of the contract and will not 
  take into account the volume or value of business generated between the parties.<strong> 
  </strong>Finally, for the reasons discussed above at section II.B.1.c, payments 
  under the Network Service Agreement are not likely to be disguised payments 
  for referrals from Company A to the IPA. 
<p><strong>b. The Medical Management Program Agreement</strong> 
<p>The second ancillary contract is the Medical Management Program Agreement, 
  pursuant to which the IPA would agree to arrange for its shareholder physicians 
  to participate in the development of credentialing, utilization review, quality 
  improvement, and case management programs and treatment protocols for Company 
  A's managed care products. The IPA and Company A would negotiate separately 
  the specific compensation for each medical program to be developed. As described 
  above, the agreement would establish a detailed set of guidelines for determining 
  the compensation for each program. These guidelines generally reflect the requirements 
  of our personal services and management contracts safe harbor, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 
  1001.952(d), and expressly provide that services to be rendered will not exceed 
  the level of services necessary and reasonable to fulfill the business purposes 
  of the arrangement. 
<p>The Medical Management Program Agreement lacks sufficient specificity to enable 
  us to make a determination regarding its propriety under the anti-kickback statute. 
  For practical purposes, it represents an agreement to agree to enter into unspecified 
  future personal services contracts. Because physician consulting arrangements 
  generally represent an area of significant abuse, personal services contracts 
  for consulting services must be subject to careful, individualized scrutiny. 
  In examining such contracts, we need to know, at a minimum, specific information 
  about the compensation, the nature of the services to be performed, the identity 
  of the particular physicians providing the services, and the existence of any 
  other relationships between the parties. This information is not presently available 
  for contracts that may be entered into pursuant to the Medical Management Program 
  Agreement. Accordingly, we express no opinion with respect to the Medical Management 
  Program Agreement; agreements entered into in accordance with its terms may 
  be subject to sanction if they violate the anti-kickback statute. However, such 
  agreements may be protected to the extent they comply with the personal services 
  and management contracts safe harbor. 
<p><strong>c. The Administrative Services Agreement</strong> 
<p>The third ancillary contract is the Administrative Services Agreement. Under 
  this agreement, the IPA will pay Company A $[ ] annually per network physician 
  with an executed PSA for performing certain designated services specified in 
  the Agreement, such as credentialing and office administration, for the IPA 
  and its physicians. The term of the contract will be ten years. 
<p>The analysis of the Administrative Services Agreement is the same as the Network 
  Service Agreement described above. The contract does not meet the personal services 
  safe harbor because the aggregate compensation to be paid for the term of the 
  agreement is not set out in advance; rather, the compensation will vary over 
  time based on the number of the IPA physicians in the network. Nevertheless, 
  the Requesters have certified that the compensation to be paid under the Agreement 
  will represent fair market value and will not take into account the value or 
  volume of business generated between the parties, and the methodology to be 
  used to determine the amount of the compensation -- $[ ] per network physician 
  -- will be established in advance and will not take into account the value or 
  volume of business generated between the parties.Also for reasons discussed 
  above, the payments are not likely to be disguised remuneration for referrals. 
<p><strong>d. The IPA Incentive Stock Plan</strong> 
<p>Integral to the joint venture arrangement is the Incentive Stock Plan to be 
  offered by the IPA to its shareholder physicians. Under the Plan, the IPA will 
  grant additional shares of the IPA stock to shareholder physicians who have 
  executed a PSA with the IPA and who meet specified performance goals related 
  to quality of HMO services, acceptance of HMO risk arrangements, and total number 
  of HMO patients. The goal of the Plan is to create incentives for physician 
  shareholders to act in a manner that will contribute to the success of Company 
  A, thereby benefitting the IPA. 
<p>The Incentive Stock Plan will not implicate the anti-kickback statute, since 
  the physicians receiving the stock are not in a position to refer business to 
  the IPA, an IPA that does not provide items or services reimbursable by a Federal 
  health care program. Nor could the receipt of such stock be construed as indirect 
  remuneration from Company A in exchange for referrals; eligibility for additional 
  the IPA stock is tied not to referrals to the managed care organization, but 
  to the assumption of risk by physicians and to measures of enrollee satisfaction. 
<p><strong>e. Provider Reimbursement for Services to Company A Plans' Enrollees</strong> 
<p>The Requesters have certified that all payments to physicians and hospitals 
  providing health care services to enrollees of the various Company A plans will 
  be at fair market value based on arms-length transactions and will not take 
  into account the volume or value of referrals to, or other business with, Company 
  A or with any of its participating hospitals or physicians. Accordingly, we 
  need not address the possibility that physicians might provide services for 
  some Company A products at below market prices in exchange for the opportunity 
  to obtain more remunerative business reimbursable by a Federal health care program. 
  Similarly, we need not address whether the Shareholder Hospitals may cause Company 
  A to pay physicians above fair market rates for services to plan enrollees in 
  order to induce the physicians to refer their fee-for-service Medicare or other 
  Federal health care program business to the Shareholder Hospitals. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>In sum, for the reasons stated above, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement, 
  considered in its totality, poses no more than a minimal risk of fraud and abuse. 
  Accordingly, based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion 
  and supplemental submissions, we conclude that the OIG will not subject the 
  Proposed Arrangement to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant 
  to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, provided that all compensation 
  in connection with the Proposed Arrangement is fair market value as certified 
  by the Requesters.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> We express no opinion 
  about the Medical Management Services Agreement (or any agreement entered into 
  in accordance with its terms) or about any arrangement disclosed in the Requesters' 
  request letter other than the Proposed Arrangement.

<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. For purposes of this advisory opinion, Company A and the IPA are the "Requesters". 
  <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. In addition, Company A is the parent of an offshore reinsurance company 
  and a management services organization, which are not involved in the Proposed 
  Arrangement. The management services organization has no employees or current 
  business, and Company A has no plans to develop business for the management 
  company and is considering selling its name to a third party. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. The PPO network presently is comprised of approximately 42 area hospitals. 
  <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. We express no opinion regarding any access fees paid by these hospitals 
  to the P.O. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. We express no opinion with respect to the legality of any existing or proposed 
  PSA. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. As described above, these PSAs will be assigned to Company A as part of 
  the stock purchase transaction. <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. For purposes of the Network Service Agreement, a prohibited affiliation 
  generally means employment of a provider by a competing managed care entity 
  or a provider's ownership interest in a competing health care entity, unless 
  such ownership interest is no more than [ ]% of a publicly traded competing 
  managed care entity's total outstanding equity. <a name="N_8_"></a> 
<p>8. Physicians who are not eligible to participate in the Incentive Stock Plan 
  will enter into one-year PSAs with the IPA (renewable at Company A's discretion) 
  and, among other things, will be required (i) to have active medical staff privileges 
  at a Company A-affiliated hospital; (ii) to meet a specific market area or practice 
  area business need, as determined by Company A, the PPO, or the HMO; and (iii) 
  to participate in all Company A health plans, subject to Company A, PPO, or 
  HMO approval based on specific plan needs. <a name="N_9_"></a> 
<p>9. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a name="N_10_"></a> 
<p>10. The IPA physicians participate in a number of health care delivery systems 
  that compete with Company A plans. Thus, a patient will sometimes have a choice 
  of plans that include his or her preferred physician. In addition, factors other 
  than ownership in a particular plan, such as payment levels, could inform a 
  physician's recommendation of one or another plan in which he or she participates. 
  <a name="N_11_"></a> 
<p>11. We are not authorized to opine on "fair market value." <u>See</u> section 
  1128D(b)(3) of the Act. Therefore, for purposes of this opinion, we have assumed 
  fair market value compensation based on the Requesters' certifications. If the 
  compensation under the Proposed Arrangement is not at fair market value, this 
  opinion will be without force and effect. </body>
