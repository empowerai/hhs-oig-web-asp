<p><strong>Re: [names redacted]</strong> 
<p><strong>Advisory Request No. 98-15</strong> 
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you asked whether an arrangement for contracted pharmacy services between University 
  A and Pharmacy Company B to facilitate an outpatient pharmacy program for the 
  University's hemophilia center pursuant to section 340B of the Public Health 
  Service Act (the "Proposed Arrangement") would constitute grounds for sanctions 
  under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act 
  (the "Act"), the exclusion authority for kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the 
  Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete 
  description of the material facts regarding the Proposed Arrangement. In issuing 
  this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information you presented 
  to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such information. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not subject the Proposed Arrangement, 
  as described in the request and supplemental submissions, to sanctions arising 
  under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act, provided that the compensation is fair market value as certified 
  by the requesters. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the requesters 
  of this advisory opinion and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below 
  and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> 
<p>Pharmacy Company B ("Company B") is a State X corporation in the business of 
  providing home infusion therapies for a number of conditions, including hemophilia. 
  In addition, Company B provides a range of related pharmaceutical services. 
<p>University A (the "University"), a State X not-for-profit corporation, operates 
  a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center, for which it receives funding through 
  the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant ("MCHB") program. The University 
  provides care to residents of States X, Y, and Z. The University does not have 
  a pharmacy license and does not operate an in-house pharmacy. 
<p><strong>B. The Section 340B</strong> <strong>Drug Discounting Program</strong> 
<p>Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act was enacted as part of the Veterans 
  Health Care Act of 1992. Section 340B enables certain entities that typically 
  serve a disproportionate number of uninsured and underinsured people to purchase 
  certain drugs for outpatient treatment from drug manufacturers at greatly reduced 
  prices. The entities that are eligible for the reduced prices -- defined in 
  the statute as "covered entities" -- include comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic 
  treatment centers receiving a grant under the MCHB program. Covered entities 
  may only sell the drugs purchased under section 340B pricing to certain of their 
  patients as defined in program guidance published in the <u>Federal Register</u>, 
  61 Fed. Reg. 55156 (Oct. 24, 1996). In response to a comment in a <u>Federal 
  Register</u> notice regarding contracted pharmacy services guidelines, the Department 
  of Health and Human Services (the "Department") noted that a modest drug markup 
  does not appear inconsistent with the 340B program, if the savings resulting 
  from the 340B discounts are used for purposes of the Federal program. <u>See</u> 
  61 Fed. Reg. 43548 (Aug. 23, 1996). 
<p>The discounted price under section 340B is calculated based on a formula that 
  takes into account the Medicaid drug rebate manufacturers are required to pay 
  to the states as a condition for payment under the Medicaid program. <u>See</u> 
  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Section 340B requires 
  manufacturers of covered drugs to enter into pricing agreements with the Secretary 
  of the Department. Covered entities enter into agreements with drug manufacturers 
  to purchase covered drugs at or below the ceiling price established in the manufacturer's 
  agreement with the Secretary and in section 340B(2). 
<p>Many covered entities do not operate an in-house pharmacy from which to dispense 
  the drugs. To facilitate greater covered entity participation in the 340B program, 
  the Health Resources and Services Administration ("HRSA") published guidelines 
  and model contract terms for contracts between covered entities and pharmacy 
  companies for pharmacy services agreements. <u>See</u> 61 Fed. Reg. 43549 (Aug. 
  23, 1996) (the "Guidelines"). The Guidelines provide a suggested format for 
  such agreements, including the following terms: 
<p>(i) the covered entity will purchase the drug and assume responsibility for 
  establishing its price; 
<p>(ii) a "ship to/bill to" procedure may be used in which the covered entity 
  purchases the drug, and the manufacturer bills the entity for the drug, but 
  ships the drug to the contract pharmacy; 
<p>(iii) the contract pharmacy will provide all pharmacy services (e.g., dispensing, 
  record keeping, utilization review, patient profiling, counseling) and may provide 
  other services (e.g., home care, reimbursement services); 
<p>(iv) the covered entity must inform its patients of their freedom to choose 
  a pharmacy provider; 
<p>(v) section 340B prices are restricted to patients of the covered entity; 
<p>(vi) the contract pharmacy and the covered entity will adhere to all Federal, 
  state, and local laws and requirements; 
<p>(vii) the contractor, with the assistance of the covered entity, will establish 
  and maintain a tracking system suitable to prevent diversion of section 340B 
  discounted drugs to individuals who are not patients; 
<p>(viii) the parties will not use drugs purchased under section 340B to dispense 
  Medicaid prescriptions, unless the contract pharmacy and the state Medicaid 
  agency have established an arrangement to prevent duplicate discounting (see 
  further discussion below); and 
<p>(ix) the parties understand that they are subject to audits by the Department 
  and the participating manufacturers. 
<p>Because covered entities typically have patients who are Medicaid beneficiaries, 
  the section 340B drug discounting program potentially subjects drug manufacturers 
  to a risk of double discounting if the manufacturer pays a Medicaid drug rebate 
  on a drug sold under 340B pricing. For example, if a drug purchased pursuant 
  to section 340B were to be sold to a Medicaid patient and billed to a Medicaid 
  program, the manufacturer could end up providing two discounts: (1) a discount 
  at the time of sale due to the 340B price limits and (2) a discount in the form 
  of the quarterly Medicaid rebate required of manufacturers under the Medicaid 
  program. To prevent this result, section 340B provides that the dispensing of 
  drugs purchased with a 340B discount must not result in the generation of a 
  Medicaid rebate. Assuming this requirement is satisfied, covered entities may 
  bill Medicaid for drugs purchased under section 340B pricing, although the amount 
  charged to Medicaid may not exceed the 340B price plus a reasonable dispensing 
  fee. <u>See</u> 58 Fed. Reg. 27293 (May 7, 1993), 58 Fed. Reg. 34058 (June 23, 
  1993). However, the Guidelines suggest that Medicaid prescriptions should not 
  be filled with drugs purchased at 340B pricing, unless the contract pharmacy 
  and the state Medicaid agency have established an arrangement to prevent duplicate 
  discounting.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p>In addition, covered entities that use a contract pharmacy may not be able 
  to bill Medicaid for drugs purchased under the 340B drug discounting program 
  because of the Medicaid prohibition on reassignment. Pursuant to the prohibition 
  on reassignment, the entity that dispenses the drugs and provides related administrative 
  services (i.e., the contract pharmacy) must be the entity that bills Medicaid. 
<p><strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>The complexities of section 340B drug discounting notwithstanding, the Proposed 
  Arrangement itself is straightforward. The University, which the parties have 
  represented is a covered entity for purposes of section 340B, desires to enter 
  into a pharmacy services contract (the "Agreement") with Company B (i) to dispense 
  anti-hemophilia factor (a covered outpatient drug) and other outpatient drugs 
  prescribed by the University's hemophilia center for certain of its patients 
  and (ii) to provide outpatient pharmacy services in connection with the 340B 
  program for those patients, including, but not limited to, inventory management, 
  billings, collections, and educational support. Company B's services will be 
  available on an as-needed basis. The University selected Company B through a 
  competitive procurement process. The Agreement is, and will be for its term, 
  the only financial arrangement between the parties. In all respects material 
  here, the Agreement complies with the Guidance issued by HRSA described above.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>The 
  compensation to be paid to Company B will be calculated in accordance with a 
  fee schedule attached to the Agreement. The fee schedule provides for Company 
  B to be paid a fixed amount per unit of anti-hemophilia factor dispensed. The 
  amount per unit drops if the volume dispensed exceeds a certain monthly threshold. 
  The compensation may be renegotiated annually. The parties have represented 
  that at all times the compensation will represent fair market value in an arms-length 
  transaction for the services rendered. 
<p>To prevent duplicate discounting and to comply with the Medicaid prohibition 
  on reassignment, the Agreement has been structured to exclude Medicaid fee-for-service 
  patients from receiving drugs through the University's outpatient drug program.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  Medicaid fee-for-service patients will be notified of this limitation in advance 
  and will be informed that they must seek pharmaceutical services elsewhere. 
  These patients may choose to seek such services directly from Company B or from 
  another provider. All University patients (Medicaid and non-Medicaid) will be 
  required to complete a patient choice form that lists alternate pharmacy services 
  providers. The form states that the University and Company B have a financial 
  relationship and requires the patient to acknowledge that he or she has selected 
  a provider freely. Company B will segregate section 340B drugs purchased by 
  the University from other pharmaceuticals and will maintain a tracking system 
  capable of locating them. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
<p>The Department has published safe harbor regulations that protect certain arrangements 
  that might otherwise technically violate the anti-kickback statute from prosecution. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions 
  that, if met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned 
  for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection 
  is only afforded to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions 
  set forth in the safe harbor. The regulatory safe harbor potentially applicable 
  to the Proposed Arrangement is the personal services and management contracts 
  safe harbor. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d). The Proposed Arrangement 
  cannot qualify under this safe harbor, however, since, among other things, the 
  nature of the services provided under the Agreement preclude an exact specification 
  of the schedule for their performance and the aggregate amount of compensation 
  is not set in advance, as required by the regulation. 
<p>Nevertheless, arrangements that do not fit squarely within a safe harbor do 
  not necessarily violate the anti-kickback statute. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 
  56 Fed. Reg. 35952, 35954 (July 29, 1991). Such arrangements must be evaluated 
  on a case-by-case basis. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Proposed 
  Arrangement poses a minimal risk of fraud or abuse and would not be subject 
  to OIG sanctions: 
<ul>
  <li><u>The Proposed Arrangement implements the congressional intent embodied 
    in section 340B and the HRSA Guidelines</u>. The Proposed Arrangement enables 
    the University's hemophilia center, which does not have access to an in-house 
    pharmacy, to receive the benefits of the discounted drugs available under 
    section 340B to hemophilia centers funded through the MCHB program. The Agreement 
    comports in all aspects material to an inquiry under the anti-kickback statute 
    with the Guidelines published by HRSA for entities seeking to comply with 
    section 340B. The Guidelines make clear that the parties are responsible for 
    complying with all Federal, state, and local laws and requirements, including 
    the anti-kickback statute. The Guidelines also provide that the parties will 
    be subject to governmental reporting and auditing requirements.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li><u>Company B will be paid fair market value for services rendered</u>. The 
    only compensation Company B will receive under the Proposed Arrangement is 
    for pharmacy services rendered, which services do not include marketing. Company 
    B will not receive payment for the drugs themselves, which will be purchased 
    by the University from drug manufacturers. The compensation will be based 
    on a fixed amount per unit of anti-hemophilia factor dispensed; Company B 
    has no control over the number of units dispensed. The parties have represented 
    that Company B's compensation will represent fair market value in an arms-length 
    transaction for the services rendered. Company B will be paid by the University, 
    and not by patients or insurers, for services provided under the Agreement 
    to patients participating in the University's outpatient pharmacy program.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li><u>Company B is not paying for referrals of Medicaid fee-for-service patients</u>. 
    Typically, contractual provisions that attempt to exclude Federal health care 
    program business from an arrangement that might otherwise violate the anti-kickback 
    statute are suspect, because often in practice the Federal health care program 
    business is improperly affected by the tainted referral arrangement despite 
    the purported "carve-out". Moreover, parallel arrangements that bifurcate 
    services between Federal and private pay business may create a risk that parties 
    will "swap" discounted private pay business for referrals of higher paying 
    Federal business. The Proposed Arrangement contains several safeguards to 
    minimize the risk of "swapping". First, under the Agreement Company B will 
    not control the price charged for drugs for non-Medicaid patients and will 
    not file claims for such drugs in its own right. Second, assuming Company 
    B's compensation under the Agreement will be fair market value for the term 
    of the Agreement, and based on the parties' representation that the Agreement 
    is and will be the only financial arrangement between the parties, there will 
    be no remuneration from Company B to the University through the provision 
    of free or below-market services. Hence, no inference arises that Company 
    B is paying for referrals. Third, the exclusion of Medicaid fee-for-service 
    patients contemplated by the Agreement is consistent with the section 340B 
    bar on duplicate discounting and the Medicaid prohibition against reassignment.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>The Proposed Arrangement preserves patient freedom of choice</u>. The 
    Proposed Arrangement preserves freedom of choice for Medicaid fee-for-service 
    patients by affording them the opportunity to use Company B as their pharmacy 
    provider. In addition, all patients will be provided with (and will be required 
    to acknowledge in writing) patient freedom of choice forms listing alternate 
    pharmacy providers and disclosing the financial relationship between the University 
    and Company B. Although such disclosures are not sufficient in and of themselves 
    to mitigate the risk of fraud, they serve an important function by promoting 
    informed patient decision-making. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>For the above reasons and based on the facts as certified by the requesters, 
  we conclude that, although the Proposed Arrangement might technically fall within 
  the prohibition of the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent were present, 
  the OIG would not seek to impose sanctions under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act 
  (as it relates to kickbacks) or section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act for payments 
  made under the Agreement, provided the compensation is fair market value as 
  certified by the requesters.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>IV. LIMITATIONS</strong> 
<p>The limitations applicable to this opinion include the following: 
<ul>

    requesters of this opinion. This advisory opinion has no application, and 
    cannot be relied upon, by any other individual or entity.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence in any matter 
    involving an entity or individual that is not a requestor to this opinion.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above. No opinion is herein expressed or implied with respect to the 
    application of any other Federal, state, or local statute, rule, regulation, 
    ordinance, or other law that may be applicable to the Arrangement, nor is 
    any opinion expressed regarding the parties' compliance with the 340B drug 
    program.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p>The Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not proceed against the requesters 
  with respect to any action that is part of the Proposed Arrangement taken in 
  good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion as long as all of the material 
  facts have been fully, completely, and accurately presented, the compensation 
  under the Agreement represents fair market value, and the Proposed Arrangement 
  in practice comports with the information provided. The OIG reserves the right 
  to reconsider the questions and issues raised in this advisory opinion and, 
  where the public interest requires, rescind, modify, or terminate this opinion. 
  In the event that this advisory opinion is modified or terminated, the OIG will 
  not proceed against the requesters with respect to any action taken in good 
  faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, where all of the relevant facts were 
  fully, completely, and accurately presented, where the compensation under the 
  Agreement represents fair market value, and where such action was promptly discontinued 
  upon notification of the modification or termination of this advisory opinion. 
  An advisory opinion may be rescinded only if the relevant and material facts 
  have not been fully, completely, and accurately disclosed to the OIG. <br>
  <br>
<p>Sincerely, <br>

<p>FOOTNOTES: 
<p>1. The price may not exceed the average manufacturers price for the drug reduced 
  by a rebate percentage equal to the average total Medicaid drug rebate required 
  under section 1927(c) of the Social Security Act divided by the average manufacturers 
  price. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. The requesters have represented that they are aware of no such state arrangement 
  to date. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. Although the parties have represented that the Agreement incorporates all 
  of the suggestions contained in the Guidelines, we note that there appear to 
  be some differences between the two. The differences are not material for purposes 
  of analyzing the Agreement under the anti-kickback statute; we express no opinion 
  regarding the Agreement's terms for any other purposes. For purposes of this 
  opinion, we have assumed, based on the requesters' certifications, that the 
  Proposed Arrangement will comply with the requirements of the 340B program. 
  <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. Medicaid managed care patients are not excluded, because drugs purchased 
  under capitated Medicaid managed care arrangements are not subject to the requirements 
  of the Medicaid drug rebate program, and therefore there is no risk of duplicate 
  discounting. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. We express no opinion regarding the liability of any party under the False 
  Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, claims submission, 
  or other related conduct. We note, however, that Company B's compensation under 
  the Agreement is not tied to the University's revenue, and therefore Company 
  B does not appear to have any added incentive to upcode or otherwise bill in 
  a manner that maximizes the University's reimbursement. <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. We are not authorized to opine on "fair market value." <u>See</u> section 
  1128D(b)(3) of the Act. Therefore, for purposes of this opinion, we have assumed 
  fair market value compensation based on the requesters' certifications. If the 
  compensation under the Agreement is not at fair market value, this opinion will 
  be without force and effect. </body>
