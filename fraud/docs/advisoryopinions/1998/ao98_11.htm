<p><strong>Advisory Opinion No. 98-11</strong> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Dear Sirs: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether a proposed purchasing arrangement involving a trade association, 
  its nursing home members, and an electrical utility consultant (the &quot;Proposed 
  Arrangement&quot;) constitutes prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), 
  and if so, whether the Proposed Arrangement constitutes grounds for the imposition 
  of sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act; the 
  civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act; 
  or the exclusion authority related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act. 
</p>
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request 
  is true and correct and constitutes a complete description of the material facts 
  regarding the Proposed Arrangement. In issuing this opinion, we have relied 
  solely on the facts and information you presented to us. We have not undertaken 
  any independent investigation of such information. This opinion is limited to 
  the facts presented. If material facts have not been disclosed, this opinion 
  is without force and effect. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> </p>
<p>The Trade Association is a not-for-profit trade association representing nursing 
  homes and assisted living facilities (the &quot;Nursing Homes&quot;). The Utility 
  Consultant is an electricity consultant licensed by State X.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Many of the individual Nursing Homes are certified Medicare and Medicaid providers; 
  the Trade Association and the Utility Consultant are not. </p>
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> </p>
<p>In 1997, State X enacted legislation deregulating the electric utility industry. 
  Effective March 1, 1998, certain reductions in electricity charges were mandated, 
  including a &quot;standard offer service&quot; and a &quot;default service&quot;, 
  which are expected to reduce overall electricity charges for users. To help 
  users obtain even greater savings, State X is licensing competitive power suppliers 
  to sell electricity in the State. Consistent with the purposes of this competitive 
  market, licensed brokers and others are permitted to seek out lower cost suppliers 
  of electricity and to arrange for the sale of this lower cost electricity to 
  customers. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>To make such brokerage services available to its members at the best possible 
  price, the Trade Association proposes to enter into a contract with the Utility 
  Consultant, pursuant to which the Utility Consultant will agree to provide electricity 
  brokerage and consulting services to Trade Association members for a fee equal 
  to seventeen percent of the cost savings achieved by the Utility Consultant 
  for each Nursing Home.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Cost savings will be 
  measured by comparing a Nursing Home's actual cost of electricity, as negotiated 
  by the Utility Consultant, with the amount that the Nursing Home would have 
  paid for &quot;standard offer service,&quot; if available, or the &quot;default 
  service&quot;. Pursuant to the contract, the Trade Association will make its 
  member list available to the Utility Consultant and will permit the Utility 
  Consultant to use the Trade Association's name for marketing purposes. The Trade 
  Association will receive a fee equal to eleven percent of the fees the Utility 
  Consultant receives from the Nursing Homes. </p>
<p>Each Nursing Home that elects to use the Utility Consultant's consulting and 
  brokerage services will enter into a separate contract with the Utility Consultant. 
  No Nursing Home will be obligated to use the Utility Consultant's services. 
  Nursing Homes will have an opportunity to compare electricity prices with other 
  consultants or utility providers before accepting the price negotiated by the 
  Utility Consultant. Each contract between the Utility Consultant and an individual 
  Nursing Home will have a term of three years, but if no reduction in electricity 
  costs is obtained, the Nursing Home will be permitted to cancel the contract 
  after one year. </p>
<p>Pursuant to a letter agreement between the Trade Association and each Nursing 
  Home, the Nursing Home will authorize the Trade Association to act as its purchasing 
  agent for electricity brokerage services, and the Trade Association will disclose 
  the amount of its fee from the Utility Consultant. The Trade Association will 
  also report to each Nursing Home annually, and to the Department of Health and 
  Human Services (&quot;HHS&quot;) upon request, the share of the Trade Association's 
  fee attributable to each Nursing Home. </p>
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce the referral of 
  business covered by a Federal health care program. Specifically, the statute 
  provides that: </p>
<p>Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] any 
  remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony. </p>
<p>Section 1128B(b) of the Act. In other words, the statute prohibits payments 
  made purposefully to induce referrals of business payable by a Federal health 
  care program. The statute ascribes liability to both sides of an impermissible 
  &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. The statute has been interpreted to cover 
  any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money 
  for the referral of services or to induce further referrals. <u>United States 
  v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 
  F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). &quot;Remuneration&quot; 
  for purposes of the anti-kickback statute includes the transfer of anything 
  of value, in cash or in kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. Violation 
  of the statute constitutes a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, 
  imprisonment up to five years or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic 
  exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
  This Office may also initiate administrative proceedings to exclude persons 
  from the Federal and State health care programs or to impose civil monetary 
  penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities under sections 
  1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>A number of statutory and regulatory &quot;safe harbors&quot; protect certain 
  arrangements that might otherwise technically violate the anti-kickback statute 
  from prosecution. <u>See</u>section 1128B(b)(3) of the Act; 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952. 
  Safe harbor protection is afforded only to those arrangements that precisely 
  meet all of the conditions set forth in the safe harbor. The relevant safe harbor 
  here is the group purchasing organizations (&quot;GPO&quot;) safe harbor. <u>See</u> 
  42 C.R.F. § 1001.952(j). </p>
<p>The GPO safe harbor provides protection for payments by a vendor of goods or 
  services to a GPO (the &quot;GPO fee&quot;). For purposes of this safe harbor, 
  a GPO is defined as an entity authorized to act as a purchasing agent for a 
  group of individuals or entities who (i) are furnishing services for which payment 
  may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program 
  and (ii) are neither wholly owned by the GPO nor subsidiaries of a parent corporation 
  that wholly owns the GPO (either directly or through another wholly-owned entity). 
  The GPO fee must be paid as part of an agreement to furnish goods or services 
  to the group of individuals or entities for which the GPO is the authorized 
  agent. </p>
<p>The GPO must have a written agreement with each individual or entity that will 
  purchase items or services from the vendor. The agreement must accurately reflect 
  the amount of the GPO fee by satisfying one of the following two conditions. 
  First, the agreement may state that the GPO fee will be three percent or less 
  of the purchase price of the goods or services sold by the vendor to the individual 
  or entity. Second, if the GPO fee is greater than three percent, the agreement 
  must state the specific amount of the fee, expressed either as a fixed sum or 
  as a fixed percentage of the value of the purchases made from the vendor by 
  the members of the group under the contract between the vendor and the GPO. 
  If the amount of the GPO fee is not known at the time the agreement is signed, 
  the agreement must state the maximum amount to be paid to the GPO by the vendor. 
  In addition, where the entity that receives the goods or services from the vendor 
  is a health care provider of services, the GPO must disclose in writing to the 
  entity at least annually, and to the Secretary upon request, the amount received 
  from each vendor with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of the entity. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. §1001.952(j). </p>
<p>In the circumstances presented here, the fee paid by the Utility Consultant 
  to the Trade Association will fit squarely within the GPO safe harbor. The Utility 
  Consultant is a vendor of electricity brokerage services. The Trade Association 
  will be authorized by its Nursing Home members pursuant to the letter agreements 
  to act as a purchasing agent for electricity brokerage services. The Trade Association 
  will negotiate the terms upon which the Nursing Homes will enter into contracts 
  with the Utility Consultant for its services, including payment terms. Each 
  Nursing Home's payment will be based on its cost savings. The Nursing Homes 
  furnish items and services that are reimbursable by the Federal health care 
  programs and will appropriately reflect the cost savings on their cost reports. 
  The Trade Association will accept as payment from the Utility Consultant a quarterly 
  sum equal to eleven percent of the Utility Consultant's fee from the Nursing 
  Homes and will disclose this fee to the Nursing Homes. The Trade Association 
  will also provide an annual report to each Nursing Home disclosing that Nursing 
  Home's proportionate share of the Trade Association's fee from the Utility Consultant. 
  None of the Nursing Homes are wholly owned by the Trade Association nor are 
  they subsidiaries of a parent corporation that wholly owns the Trade Association. 
</p>
<p>The GPO safe harbor protects only the fee from the vendor to the GPO. Potential 
  remuneration between the vendor and the GPO members must be separately analyzed. 
  Here, there is minimal risk of fraud or abuse between the Nursing Homes and 
  the Utility Consultant. First, neither party is likely to be a referral source 
  for the other. Moreover, the Utility Consultant's fee is based solely on electricity 
  cost savings recognized by the Nursing Homes through arrangements fostered by 
  the Utility Consultant. The net cost of electricity used by the Nursing Homes 
  will be accurately reflected on the Nursing Homes' cost reports, and thus any 
  cost savings achieved through the Proposed Arrangement will benefit the Federal 
  health care programs. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>Based on the facts presented, we conclude that the fee to be paid by the Utility 
  Consultant to the Trade Association falls within the plain language of the GPO 
  safe harbor. We further conclude, based on the certified facts in the Requestors' 
  request for an advisory opinion (including the fact that the Nursing Homes will 
  accurately reflect electricity costs on their cost reports), that the Requestors 
  will not be subject to OIG sanctions under sections 1128(b)(7)(as it relates 
  to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act for payment of the Utility Consultant's 
  fee by the Nursing Homes. </p>

<p><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong><a name="N_1_"></a> </p>
<p>1. The Trade Association and the Utility Consultant are joint &quot;Requestors&quot; 
  of this advisory opinion. <a name="N_2_"></a></p>
<p>2. The Requestors have represented that the payment terms between the Nursing 
  Homes and the Utility Consultant may be modified in the future by agreement 
  of the parties. We express no opinion about any different compensation terms. 
  This opinion is limited to the compensation terms described here. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>
<p>3. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. </p>
