<p><strong>Re: Advisory Opinion No. 98-17</strong> 
<p>Dear [Names redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether donations by Company X ("Company X") to Organization A ("Organization 
  A") (an independent, 501(c)(3) charitable organization) for the purpose of funding 
  a program to pay for Supplementary Medical Insurance ("Medicare Part B") or 
  Medicare Supplementary Health Insurance ("Medigap") premiums for financially 
  needy Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease, where some or all 
  of the beneficiaries may be receiving treatment from Company X (the "Proposed 
  Arrangement"), would constitute grounds for the imposition of civil monetary 
  penalties under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"). 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete 
  description of the material facts and agreements among the parties regarding 
  the Proposed Arrangement. In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on 
  the facts and information you presented to us. We have not undertaken any independent 
  investigation of such information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. 
  If material facts have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and 
  effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion and subject 
  to the conditions described below, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement 
  would not constitute grounds for the imposition of civil monetary penalties 
  under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the requesters and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. End-Stage Renal Disease and Medicare's Dialysis Benefit</strong> 
<p>End-stage renal disease ("ESRD") is a chronic disease that requires routine 
  dialysis, as well as regular monitoring of laboratory values, diet, and medication. 
  In addition to chronic renal failure, ESRD patients commonly suffer from certain 
  co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes, anemia, hypertension, and congestive 
  heart failure. 
<p>In 1972, Congress created a special Medicare benefit for all individuals with 
  ESRD who are eligible for Social Security benefits (or are dependents of those 
  who are eligible). Eligible persons are entitled to benefits under Medicare 
  Part A and are eligible to enroll in Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B payments 
  generally cover eighty percent of the composite rate for Medicare-covered maintenance 
  dialysis services, as well as eighty percent of physician services and certain 
  ancillary services, with the patient responsible for the remaining twenty percent.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>Medigap 
  insurance can be purchased to cover a patient's annual Medicare coinsurance 
  obligations for Medicare-covered services. 
<p><strong>B. The Parties </strong> 
<p>Company X owns twelve renal dialysis facilities in State Z and is a wholly-owned, 
  direct subsidiary of Company Y. Organization A is an independent, 501(c)(3) 
  charitable organization providing financial support to needy persons in State 
  Z with ESRD for items such as transportation, medication, and other living expenses. 
  Organization A is governed by a board of directors comprised of health professionals, 
  community volunteers, and persons with kidney disease. No employee or affiliate 
  of Company X or Company Y, serves on the Organization A board. The Organization 
  A board is not directly or indirectly controlled by Company X, Company Y, or 
  any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.<strong> </strong>It has been the policy 
  of the Organization A board not to have any employees of dialysis programs serve 
  on the board. <strong> </strong> 
<p>Organization A provides financial support to financially needy ESRD patients 
  through a general fund and an emergency fund. Grants from the general fund require 
  a patient to fill out an application providing detailed financial information 
  for the applicant's entire household.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>Eligibility 
  for the general fund is based on guidelines measuring monthly income and family 
  size and a demonstration that the applicant is unable to pay his or her monthly 
  expenses. Individuals who meet the guidelines are eligible to receive $500 per 
  calender year from the general fund. A social worker submits the applications 
  to the Organization A board, which gives approval and distributes the funds. 
  Individuals receiving assistance from the emergency fund must show a demonstrated 
  need and receive approval by a social worker. Emergency funds do not require 
  an individual to fill out a financial application. Requests from the emergency 
  fund are limited to $35, four times a year, or a maximum of $140 per year per 
  individual. 
<p><strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Organization A wishes to extend the general fund assistance program to include 
  financial assistance to financially needy ESRD patients for the costs of health 
  insurance premiums, including Medicare Part B and Medigap premiums. Social workers 
  will assist patients in identifying all available sources of assistance for 
  which they qualify, including assistance for health insurance premiums and, 
  if appropriate, will refer financially needy patients to Organization A for 
  such assistance. Although most, if not all, patient contact with Organization 
  A is through a provider's social worker, if a patient who does not already have 
  a provider contacts Organization A to inquire about dialysis facilities, Organization 
  A will provide the patient with a complete list of all dialysis facilities in 
  the area and will not express any preference among facilities. 
<p>Organization A will continue to use its current financial assistance application 
  in assessing the financial need and eligibility of all patients, whether<strong> 
  </strong>self-referred, referred by Company X, or referred by other non-donor 
  dialysis providers. In most cases, an ESRD social worker, employed by the dialysis 
  provider, will submit a completed application to Organization A. Approval of 
  the health insurance premium application will be made by the Organization A 
  board's executive committee comprised of the president, vice president, secretary, 
  treasurer, and two "at-large" board members. Determinations will be based solely 
  on Organization A's good faith assessment of a patient's financial need. Organization 
  A will not take the identity of the referring facility or the amount of any 
  provider's donation into consideration when assessing patient applications or 
  making grant determinations. Any qualified person will be free, and encouraged, 
  to apply for grants under the expanded program. The patient can re-apply at 
  any time his or her financial or family situation changes. All grants will be 
  reviewed on an annual basis for eligibility. Organization A will send all premium 
  payments directly to the insurance company. 
<p>Under the Proposed Arrangement, funding for the expanded program will be primarily 
  donated by Company X. Company X will make contributions to Organization A without 
  any restrictions or conditions placed on the donation. Company X has acknowledged 
  that "contributions . . . will be gifts without any guarantee or promise on 
  the part of Organization A that patients referred to Organization A for possible 
  financial assistance with their insurance premiums will receive such assistance. 
  Organization A's discretion as to the uses of contributions will be absolute, 
  independent, and autonomous." 
<p>Company X will not track the amount that Organization A pays on behalf of patients 
  dialyzing at its facilities in order to calculate future contributions. However, 
  in calculating its contributions to Organization A, Company X has indicated 
  that it may consider what it would have otherwise paid on behalf of financially 
  needy patients. Company X will not advertise the availability of possible financial 
  assistance to the public and will not disclose directly or indirectly to individual 
  patients it refers to Organization A that Company X has donated to Organization 
  A. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act provides for the imposition of civil monetary 
  penalties against any person who: 
<p>"offers to or transfers remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits 
  under subchapter XVIII of this chapter, or under a State health care program 
  (as defined in section [1128(h) of the Act]) that such person knows or should 
  know is likely to influence such individual to order or receive from a particular 
  provider, practitioner, or supplier any item or service for which payment may 
  be made, in whole or in part, under subchapter XVIII of this chapter, or a State 
  health care program (as so defined)." 
<p>Section 1128A(i)(6) defines "remuneration", in relevant part, as "transfers 
  of items or services for free or for other than fair market value."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>A. Donations by Company X Do Not Constitute Remuneration to an Eligible 
  Beneficiary</strong> 
<p>Company X's contributions to Organization A would not constitute grounds for 
  the imposition of civil monetary penalties under section 1128A(a)(5) of the 
  Act, because the contributions are not made to, or on behalf of, an individual 
  eligible for Medicare or State health care program benefits. Organization A 
  is an independent, 501(c)(3) charitable organization whose charitable purposes 
  include aiding ESRD patients and their families and is not subject to control, 
  directly or indirectly, by Company X, Company Y, or any of its subsidiaries 
  or affiliates. Under the Proposed Arrangement, Organization A will have absolute 
  discretion regarding the use of provider contributions made to Organization 
  A. 
<p>In addition, eligibility for Organization A's health insurance premium assistance 
  is available to any financially needy ESRD patient regardless of the provider; 
  it is not limited to patients of Company X. Organization A will make all health 
  insurance premium eligibility determinations using its own criteria, and Organization 
  A will not take into account the identity of the referring provider or the amount 
  of the provider's donation to Organization A. 
<p>As an additional safeguard, Company X has represented that it will not track 
  the amounts that Organization A pays on behalf of patients dialyzing at its 
  facilities in order to calculate amounts of future contributions, although donations 
  may take into account the amounts that Company X would have otherwise expended 
  on financially needy patients. Contributions will not be earmarked for the use 
  of particular beneficiaries or groups of beneficiaries. Company X may change 
  the amount of its contributions or discontinue contributing to Organization 
  A at any time. Company X has represented that it will determine the amount of 
  its contributions without consulting any other dialysis providers. 
<p>In sum, Organization A's status as an independent, 501(c)(3) charitable organization 
  and its administration of the Proposed Arrangement provides sufficient insulation 
  so that the premium payments should not be attributed to Company X. Company 
  X's contributions to Organization A will not assure that the amount of health 
  insurance premium assistance its patients receive bears any relationship to 
  the amount of its donations. Indeed, Company X is not guaranteed that beneficiaries 
  it refers to Organization A will receive any assistance at all. In these circumstances, 
  we do not believe that the donations by Company X to Organization A can reasonably 
  be construed as payments to eligible beneficiaries of Medicare or a State health 
  care program. 
<p><strong>B. Organization A's Purchase of Premiums Is Not Likely to Influence 
  a Beneficiary's Choice of a Particular Provider</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act prohibits payments to, or on behalf of, Medicare 
  or State health care program beneficiaries only if the payments are likely to 
  influence such beneficiaries to use a particular provider. In the circumstances 
  presented by the Proposed Arrangement, we believe that Organization A's payments 
  of premiums on behalf of financially needy beneficiaries are not likely to influence 
  a beneficiary's selection of a particular provider. 
<p>As part of the application process for health insurance premium assistance, 
  Organization A requires certain financial information from the applicant, as 
  well as additional information from the social worker. While patients may apply 
  directly to Organization A, more commonly the dialysis provider's social worker 
  refers the application to Organization A on the patient's behalf. Thus, a patient 
  will often have selected a provider prior to submitting his or her application 
  for assistance or prior to the initial Organization A premium payment. Moreover, 
  Company X will not publicly advertise the availability of possible financial 
  assistance. This should reduce the probability that a beneficiary would select 
  a Company X facility based on its participation in the health insurance premium 
  program. Most importantly, once in possession of Medicare Part B or Medigap 
  coverage, a beneficiary will be able to select any provider of his or her choice. 
  Simply put, Organization A's payment of premiums will expand, rather than limit, 
  beneficiaries' freedom of choice of providers. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>We conclude that the Proposed Arrangement would not constitute grounds for 
  the imposition of civil monetary penalties under section 1128A(a)(5) of the 
  Act. A violation of section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act requires that something of 
  value be given to a beneficiary, either directly or on his or her behalf. The 
  contributions to Organization A by Company X are not made to or on behalf of 
  beneficiaries.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Moreover, while the premium 
  payments by Organization A may constitute remuneration to beneficiaries, they 
  are not likely to influence patients to order or receive services from particular 
  providers. To the contrary, the insurance coverage purchased by Organization 
  A will follow a patient regardless of which provider the patient selects, thereby 
  enhancing patient freedom of choice in health care providers.
