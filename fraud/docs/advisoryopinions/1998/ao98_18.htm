<p><strong>Re: Advisory Opinion No. 98-18</strong> 
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  whether an ophthalmologist's proposed sublease to an optometrist of certain 
  imaging equipment (the "Sublease") would meet the criteria of the equipment 
  rental safe harbor, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(c). The imaging equipment may 
  be used by the ophthalmologist to conduct telemedicine consultations relating 
  to the optometrist's patients. The Sublease and the telemedicine consultation 
  arrangement are referred to in this opinion letter collectively as the "Proposed 
  Arrangement". 
<p>You have certified that all of the information provided in the request letter, 
  including all supplementary submissions, is true and correct and constitutes 
  a complete description of the relevant facts and agreements among the parties. 
  You have also certified that, upon our approval, you will undertake to effectuate 
  the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in the request for an advisory opinion (including 
  the certification of fair market value), we conclude that the Sublease satisfies 
  the criteria of the equipment rental safe harbor, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(c). 
  We further conclude that the arrangement for the provision of telemedicine consultations 
  may involve prohibited remuneration if the requisite intent to induce referrals 
  is present, but would not be subject to Office of Inspector General ("OIG") 
  sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b), 
  based on the facts presented. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the requestor and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> 
<p>Dr. Y (the "Requestor") is an ophthalmologist licensed to practice medicine 
  in State A. He is a participating provider in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
  Dr. X is an optometrist licensed to practice optometry in State A. Dr. X is 
  a Medicare provider who performs Medicare-covered services. She has several 
  office locations. The office location relevant to the Proposed Arrangement is 
  located approximately twenty miles from Dr. Y's office. 
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Dr. Y wishes to conduct telemedicine consultations for patients in remote locations. 
  To this end, Dr. Y intends to lease from a third-party equipment leasing company 
  (the "Lessor") certain telemedicine equipment (the "Leased Equipment") that 
  will enable him to view images of a patient's eye transmitted from such locations. 
  Dr. Y proposes to enter into an arrangement with Dr. X to locate in Dr. X's 
  office the components of the Leased Equipment that transmit the images to Dr. 
  Y's office. These components can also be used by Dr. X as a fundus photography 
  system to document a patient's ocular disease. Dr. Y will retain in his office 
  the components of the Leased Equipment that allow him to view the transmitted 
  images. This arrangement will enable Dr. Y to consult with Dr. X in connection 
  with those of her patients who may require ophthalmologist services beyond the 
  scope of her optometry practice. If, after such consultation, Dr. Y determines 
  that a patient requires services beyond the scope of Dr. X's practice, Dr. X 
  may refer the patient to Dr. Y, although the patient will be free to select 
  any ophthalmologist. Neither Dr. Y nor Dr. X will bill the patient or any insurer 
  for the telemedicine consultation. 
<p>Dr. Y proposes subleasing the equipment to Dr. X pursuant to a written sublease 
  ("Sublease"). The Sublease will describe the subleased equipment with specificity 
  and will cover all of the equipment leased between Dr. Y and Dr. X for the twelve-month 
  term of the Sublease. The Sublease will provide for monthly rent of $[redacted], 
  an amount determined by multiplying the cost associated with purchasing a fundus 
  photography unit from the Lessor by a rental factor of [redacted]. This rental 
  factor is ordinarily applied by the Lessor to equipment leases of the length 
  involved here for the equipment. <strong> </strong>The rent to Dr. X amounts 
  to a direct "pass through" of the rent being paid by Dr. Y to the Lessor for 
  the same equipment. Dr. Y has certified that the rental amount under the Sublease 
  constitutes fair market rent for the subleased equipment. The Sublease will 
  prohibit Dr. X from advertising or marketing in any respect her ability to provide 
  telemedicine consultation services. The only arrangement between Dr. Y and Dr. 
  X is the Sublease and there are, and will be, no oral or written collateral 
  agreements or understandings between them, including agreements or understandings 
  regarding the referral of patients from either party to the other. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 
  &#167; 1320a-7b(b). Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes criminal liability to 
  parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything 
  of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violations of the statute constitute a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from the Federal and State health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1320a-7(b)(7), 1320a-7a(a)(7).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>We have previously stated our view that a gift to an existing or potential 
  referral source that has independent value to such source implicates the anti-kickback 
  statute and may be unlawful if the donor of the gift has the requisite intent 
  to induce Federal health care program referrals. For example, in the preamble 
  to the 1991 safe harbor regulations, we stated that giving a physician who is 
  a referral source a free computer that has independent value to the physician 
  may violate the statute. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. 35978 (July 1991); <u>see also</u>, 
  <u>e.g.</u>, OIG Special Fraud Alert, 56 Fed. Reg. 65377 (Oct. 1994) (explaining 
  that the anti-kickback statute is implicated where a clinical laboratory provides 
  a phlebotomist to a physician to perform tasks normally the responsibility of 
  the physician's office staff). 
<p>A number of statutory and regulatory "safe harbors" protect certain arrangements 
  that might otherwise technically violate the anti-kickback statute from prosecution. 
  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b)(3); 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The safe 
  harbor potentially applicable to the Sublease is the equipment rental safe harbor 
  at 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(c). This safe harbor protects equipment rental 
  payments if: 
<p>-- there is a written lease signed by the parties; 
<p>-- the lease specifies the equipment covered by the lease; 
<p>-- where the lease is intended to provide the lessee with the use of the equipment 
  for periodic intervals, rather than full-time for the term of the lease, the 
  lease specifies the exact schedule, length, and rent for the intervals; 
<p>-- the term of the lease is for at least one year; and 
<p>-- the aggregate rental charge is set in advance, consistent with fair market 
  value in an arms-length transaction, and is not determined in a manner that 
  takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise 
  generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part 
  under Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(c). For purposes of the equipment rental safe harbor, 
  "fair market value" means the value of the equipment when obtained from a manufacturer 
  or professional distributor, provided that the value is not adjusted to reflect 
  any additional value one party would attribute to the equipment as a result 
  of its proximity or convenience to sources of referrals or business otherwise 
  generated for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or 
  a State health care program. Strict compliance with all safe harbor elements 
  is required in order to receive safe harbor protection. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. 
  35952, 35954 (July 29, 1991). 
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Dr. Y and Dr. X are potential sources of referrals of Federal health care program 
  business for one another and therefore anything of value exchanged between them 
  potentially implicates the anti-kickback statute. In this regard, there are 
  two aspects of the Proposed Arrangement to be analyzed: the Sublease for the 
  fundus photography equipment and the arrangement for free telemedicine consultations. 
<p><strong>1. The Sublease</strong> 
<p>The Sublease will be in writing and will specify the exact equipment subleased. 
  The Sublease will cover all of the equipment subleased between Dr. Y and Dr. 
  X for its twelve-month term.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>The Sublease will 
  provide for a fixed rental payment of $[redacted] per month, resulting in an 
  annual aggregate rental payment fixed in advance of $[redacted]. The rent to 
  be paid under the Sublease, presumed to be fair market value for purposes of 
  this advisory opinion,<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> is based on the equipment's 
  value to Dr. X as a fundus photography unit. The rental charge has been determined 
  by multiplying the supplier's purchase price for a fundus photography unit by 
  a rental factor ordinarily applied by the supplier for leases of the duration 
  of the Sublease. Thus, the rental charge will not be determined in a manner 
  that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business generated 
  between the parties. In sum, because all safe harbor elements are satisfied 
  (assuming fair market value), the rent paid under the Sublease would not constitute 
  prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute. 
<p><strong>2. The Telemedicine Consultations</strong> 
<p>The Sublease will only cover the rental of a fundus photography system to be 
  used for producing images of the eye in Dr. X's office. However, the arrangement 
  for telemedicine consultations itself may have value to Dr. X. When connected 
  to the receiving components retained by Dr. Y (for which Dr. X will not be paying 
  under the Sublease), the subleased equipment will enable Dr. X to access telemedicine 
  consultations with Dr. Y. This may enable Dr. X to expand her business or to 
  earn additional fees associated with her role in performing the consultations. 
  However, based on the facts submitted by Dr. Y, Dr. X will not advertise or 
  market her access to telemedicine consultations and will not charge a fee in 
  connection with such consultations. Therefore, the telemedicine consultations 
  will have minimal, if any, value to Dr. X. <br>
  <br>
<p>Conversely, the arrangement for telemedicine consultations may have value to 
  Dr. Y. Dr. X's referral of a patient to Dr. Y in conjunction with a telemedicine 
  consultation will provide Dr. Y the opportunity to generate Federal health care 
  program business. However, the Proposed Arrangement permits Dr. X's patients 
  the freedom to choose any ophthalmologist. In addition, Dr. Y has certified 
  that the only arrangement between Dr. Y and Dr. X is the Sublease and that there 
  are, and will be, no oral or written collateral agreements or understandings 
  between them, including agreements or understandings regarding the referral 
  of patients from either party to the other. Based on these representations, 
  any opportunity for Dr. Y to generate business from telemedicine consultations 
  will not be an inducement for Dr. Y to refer patients to Dr. X. 
<p>Accordingly, although the telemedicine consultation arrangement may constitute 
  prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent 
  is present, the OIG will not subject it to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>Based on the facts as certified by Dr. Y (including Dr. Y's certification that 
  the rental amount to be paid under the Sublease constitutes fair market value 
  in an arms-length transaction) and subject to the conditions stated in this 
  opinion letter, we conclude that the Sublease would meet the criteria of the 
  equipment rental safe harbor at 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(c). We further conclude 
  that the arrangement for the provision of telemedicine consultations may involve 
  prohibited remuneration if the requisite intent to induce referrals is present, 
  but would not be subject to OIG sanctions under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1320a-7(b)(7) 
  &amp; 1320a-7a(a)(7), based on the facts presented. 
<p><strong>IV. LIMITATIONS</strong> 
<p>The limitations applicable to this opinion include the following: 
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is issued only to Dr. Y, the Requestor of this opinion. 
    This advisory opinion has no application, and cannot be relied upon, by any 
    other individual or entity.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence in any matter 
    involving an entity or individual that is not a requestor to this opinion.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above. No opinion is herein expressed or implied with respect to the 
    application of any other Federal, state, or local statute, rule, regulation, 
    ordinance, or other law that may be applicable to the Proposed Arrangement.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
  <li>No opinion is expressed herein regarding the liability of any party under 
    the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, 
    claims submission, cost reporting, or related conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p>The OIG will not proceed against the Requestor with respect to any action that 
  is part of the Proposed Arrangement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory 
  opinion as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and 
  accurately presented, the compensation under the Sublease represents fair market 
  value in accordance with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. 
<p>&#167; 1001.952(c), and the Proposed Arrangement in practice comports with 
  the information provided. The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions 
  and issues raised in this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, 
  rescind, modify, or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory 
  opinion is modified or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the Requestor 
  with respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, 
  where all of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented, 
  where the compensation under the Sublease represents fair market value pursuant 
  to 42 C.F.R. 
<p>&#167; 1001.952(c), and where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification 
  of the modification or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion 
  may be rescinded only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, 
  completely, and accurately disclosed to the OIG. 
<p>Sincerely, 
<p>/s/ 
<p>D. McCarty Thornton 
<p>Chief Counsel to the Inspector General 
<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the Proposed 
  Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis 
  for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same for both. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. The Sublease agreement provides for early "for cause" termination by Dr. 
  Y, if Dr. X fails to perform any conditions or covenants of the Sublease or 
  removes, or attempts to remove, the subleased equipment from her office without 
  Dr. Y's consent. For purposes of this advisory opinion, termination of the Sublease 
  prior to the end of the initial one-year term would be deemed to be a material 
  change in the facts presented and result in this advisory opinion being without 
  force and effect. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. We are precluded by statute from opining on whether fair market value shall 
  be or was paid for goods, services, or property. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 
  1320a-7d(b)(3)(A). <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. This advisory opinion will be without force and effect if Dr. X charges 
  a fee for the telemedicine consultations or does not comply fully with the prohibition 
  on marketing her access to telemedicine consultations. </body>
