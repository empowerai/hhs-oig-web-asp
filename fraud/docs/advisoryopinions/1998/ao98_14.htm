<p><strong>Advisory Opinion No. 98-14</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether an existing pharmaceutical restocking program (the "Drug Program") 
  and a proposed medical supplies restocking program (the "Supply Program) (collectively, 
  the "Arrangements") constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), and, if so, 
  whether the Arrangements constitute grounds for the imposition of sanctions 
  under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the exclusion 
  authority related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil 
  monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary information, is true and correct, and constitutes 
  a complete description of the material facts regarding the Arrangements. In 
  issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information you 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Arrangements described in your advisory opinion request and supplemental 
  submissions <u>could </u>constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute, <u>if</u> the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal health 
  care program business were present, but that the OIG will not subject the Drug 
  Program, as described in the request and supplemental submissions, to sanctions 
  arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), 
  or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the addressees 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>The requesters of this advisory opinion are four hospital providers located 
  in four counties in the northeast of State X (the "Hospitals"). The first requester 
  is Hospital One ("Hospital One"), which operates one hospital in County A, State 
  X, and three hospitals in County B, State X. The second requester is Hospital 
  Two ("Hospital Two"), which operates one hospital in County A, State X, one 
  hospital in County B, State X, and one free-standing emergency facility in County 
  C, State X. The third requester is Hospital Three ("Hospital Three") located 
  in County D, State X. The final requester is Hospital Four ("Hospital Four") 
  located in County B, State X. These Hospitals represent all of the hospital 
  providers in the greater [four county] metropolitan emergency medical services 
  area (the "Four County EMS Area").<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>Each Hospital is a member of at least one of the three emergency medical services 
  ("EMS") councils operating in the four-county area (the "EMS Councils"). The 
  first EMS council is Council F ("Council F"), which operates in County A. Council 
  F's mission is, among other things, to coordinate the various levels of EMS, 
  educational programs, and interaction between pre-hospital care providers and 
  other health care providers in the county and to encourage the implementation 
  of EMS standards and criteria pursuant to local, state, and national guidelines. 
  Hospital One and Hospital Two are members of Council F. The second EMS council 
  is Council G ("Council G"), which operates in Counties B and D. Council G's 
  mission includes upgrading emergency medical care in the region; serving as 
  a central coordinating body; and implementing and monitoring systems of quality 
  assurance for EMS in the region. Hospitals One, Two, Three, and Four are all 
  members of Council G. The third EMS council is Council H ("Council H"). Council 
  H was formed to oversee pre-hospital emergency medical care in the county, including 
  promulgating standard, community-wide pre-hospital EMS operating protocols. 
  Hospital Two is a member of Council H. Each EMS Council has diverse membership, 
  including, among others, local physicians, hospital representatives, paramedics, 
  EMS technicians, consumer representatives, EMS education providers, and local 
  officials. 
<p>The Hospitals participate in a pharmaceutical restocking program (the "Drug 
  Program") with area ambulance providers in connection with emergency medical 
  transports. Typically under the Drug Program, a receiving hospital restocks 
  an ambulance with the medications used in connection with emergency pre-hospital 
  services provided by the ambulance provider to the transported patient. The 
  EMS units are not charged, and do not pay, for restocked items. As part of the 
  exchange, the EMS unit must provide documentation of the drugs used during the 
  ambulance run. All hospitals in the Four County EMS Area participate in the 
  Drug Program; any other hospital located within the four- county area may participate. 
  The restocked pharmaceuticals are provided to any ambulance provider that transports 
  an emergency patient to the hospital. 
<p>Council F, Council G, and Council H have facilitated the Drug Program within 
  the four-county area in various ways. The EMS Councils' activities have included, 
  for example: initiating drug exchange programs; approving policies and protocols 
  that govern drug exchange programs; creating and implementing protocols for 
  the administration of drugs used during patient transport; and coordinating 
  efforts between public and private pre-hospital providers, hospital emergency 
  staff, and consumers to promote the highest quality medical care for victims 
  of sudden illness or injury. 
<p>The Hospitals also propose a limited medical supplies restocking program (the 
  "Supply Program"), pursuant to which the Hospitals would restock certain supplies 
  used by ambulance providers during emergency pre-hospital transportation. To 
  initiate, coordinate, and monitor the Supply Program, the Hospitals have established 
  a joint committee, comprised of the EMS coordinator or a higher level employee 
  from each Hospital. Any hospital located within the four-county area may participate. 
  The restocked medical supplies will be provided to any ambulance provider that 
  transports an emergency patient to a participating hospital. 
<p>The Hospitals want to establish a limited supply exchange program targeting 
  specific supplies that they believe will enhance efficient coordination and 
  integration between their emergency rooms and emergency pre-hospital care providers. 
  To this end, the joint committee developed the following list of medical supplies 
  to be restocked under the auspices of the Supply Program: intravenous solutions; 
  intravenous tubing; intravenous catheters and needles; oxygen cannulas and oxygen 
  masks; endotracheal tubes; tuberculin, intramuscular and 10 cc syringes; blood 
  collection tubes; and linens.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p>The Supply Program will allow ambulances to be fully stocked with a standard 
  complement of these supplies, making it easier, for example, for patients arriving 
  by emergency ambulance to be connected to Hospital emergency room systems without 
  interruption. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p>This Office's concern with the provision of goods and services for free or 
  at below-market rates to potential referral sources is longstanding and clear: 
  such arrangements are suspect and may violate the anti-kickback statute if one 
  purpose is to induce referrals of Federal health care program business. 
<p>The provision by a hospital of free supplies and medications to an ambulance 
  provider fits squarely within the meaning of remuneration for purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute. An inference may be drawn that one purpose of such remuneration 
  is to induce the ambulance provider to bring patients to the hospital. However, 
  the strength of that inference may vary with the circumstances of the specific 
  arrangement. 
<p>With respect to the Drug Program, the factual circumstances presented here 
  are substantially similar to those present in the factual circumstances addressed 
  by OIG Advisory Opinions 98-7 and 98-13. Thus, for the reasons stated in those 
  opinions, we conclude that the OIG would not subject the Drug Program, as described 
  in the request letter and supplemental submissions, to sanctions under section 
  1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  As in those opinions, the involvement of the entire EMS community in the Drug 
  Program, including hospitals, EMS physicians, ambulance providers, paramedics, 
  EMS education providers, consumer representatives, and local officials, provides 
  adequate assurance that the plan is designed to improve and enhance the delivery 
  of EMS in the Four County EMS Area for the benefit of the entire community. 
<p>While we recognize that the Supply Program may also provide a community benefit, 
  we are unable to reach a similar conclusion with respect to the application 
  of the anti-kickback statute to that program. The Supply Program would be implemented 
  under the auspices of a committee formed exclusively of Hospital representatives, 
  rather than an EMS council or similar group more broadly representative of the 
  EMS community at large. The involvement of a broad range of representatives 
  of the EMS community provides substantial assurance that an ambulance restocking 
  program will operate for the benefit of the local community and will not be 
  undertaken solely for the benefit of a single provider or group of providers. 
<p>We wish to make clear that this opinion does not mean that the Supply Program 
  (or similar ambulance restocking programs) would violate the anti-kickback statute. 
  Rather, because it involves the provision of free goods to potential referral 
  sources, the Supply Program <u>might</u> violate the statute <u>if</u> one purpose 
  of the Program is to induce Federal health care program business. Thus, whether 
  the proposed Supply Program would, in fact, be unlawful requires a case-by-case 
  determination of the actual intent of the parties based on all relevant facts 
  and circumstances. We cannot determine intent based solely on documentary submissions; 
  accordingly, a determination of intent is beyond the scope of the advisory opinion 
  process. <u>See </u>62 Fed. Reg. 7351 (Feb. 19, 1997). <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>The advisory opinion process is a "means of relating the anti-kickback statute 
  to the particular facts of a specific arrangement." 62 Fed. Reg. 7350, 7351 
  (Feb. 19, 1997). The advisory opinion process permits this Office to protect 
  specific arrangements that "contain[] limitations, requirements, or controls 
  that give adequate assurance that Federal health care programs cannot be abused." 
  <u>Id.</u> In evaluating an arrangement's potential to lead to fraud or abuse 
  of Federal health care programs, no one fact or element is necessarily dispositive. 
  We are further persuaded that, taken as a whole, the aspects of the Drug Program 
  described above -- including, but not limited to, the Hospitals' relationships 
  with coordinated regional EMS systems, the role of the regional EMS councils, 
  and the Program's limitation to emergency medical services -- create sufficient 
  limitations, requirements, or controls so as to give adequate assurance that 
  the Drug Program will not lead to program abuse under the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  The Supply program does not contain similar safeguards. 
<p>Accordingly, we conclude that while the Arrangements might technically violate 
  the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce referrals were 
  present, the OIG will not impose sanctions on the requesters in connection with 
  the Drug Program under sections 1128(b)(7) (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act, based on the facts certified in the requesters' request for an advisory 
  opinion. The OIG cannot give a similar assurance that the Supply Program would 
  not be subject to sanction if the parties were to have the requisite intent 
  to induce referrals of Federal health care program business. <br>
