<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-11</strong> </p>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  an arrangement sponsored by Coalition A (the &quot;Coalition&quot;) to provide 
  psychotherapy services at free or reduced prices using residents from local 
  teaching facilities as clinicians (the &quot;Arrangement&quot;). Specifically, 
  you have inquired whether the Arrangement constitutes grounds for sanctions 
  under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act 
  (the &quot;Act&quot;), or under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, which prohibits 
  the offering of inducements to beneficiaries in order to influence their selection 
  of a provider for Medicare or Medicaid covered services. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude (i) that the Arrangement would 
  potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts present in the Arrangement as described and certified 
  in your request letter and supplemental submissions, the Office of Inspector 
  General (&quot;OIG&quot;) will not subject the Coalition to sanctions for violations 
  of the anti-kickback statute under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act; and (ii) that the OIG will not subject the Coalition to sanctions under 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement as described 
  and certified in your request letter and supplemental submissions. </p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Coalition, 
  the requester of this opinion, and is further qualified as set out in Part IV 
  below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. </p>
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p>The Coalition is a State X nonprofit organization formed by Foundation B, a 
  501(c)(3) charitable organization that operates for the benefit and in support 
  of the Coalition; Entity C; and Entity D. Pursuant to the Arrangement, the Coalition 
  provides psychodynamically-oriented psychotherapy at free or reduced prices 
  to individuals who meet financial and clinical criteria. The therapy is typically 
  provided by advanced psychiatric residents from local teaching facilities.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  The residents donate their time and services to the Coalition, as do members 
  of the teaching faculties who provide clinical training and supervision. </p>
<p>The teaching facilities involved in the Arrangement are Hospital E, Hospital 
  F, and Hospital G (collectively, the &quot;Participating Institutions&quot;). 
  The Arrangement enables the Participating Institutions to provide training to 
  their residents in psychodynamically-oriented psychotherapy (a less time-intensive 
  and less costly form of talk therapy than psychoanalysis) which they are not 
  currently providing. A total of 45 to 50 residents provide services under the 
  Arrangement. Prior to the Arrangement, these residents had to arrange and pay 
  for supervised training in this form of therapy outside their residency programs. 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The Coalition handles all billing and collections; neither the clinicians, 
  nor their supervisors, bill for services provided under the Arrangement. Although 
  some services that the Coalition provides may be covered by insurance, including 
  Medicare or Medicaid, the Coalition does not bill Medicare, Medicaid, or any 
  other third party insurer. In addition, the Coalition notifies patients that 
  they are ineligible for Coalition services if they seek third-party reimbursement. 
</p>
<p>The Coalition screens prospective patients based on financial and clinical 
  criteria. Most of the Coalition's patients self-pay for the therapy sessions 
  on a sliding fee schedule based on income and family size. However, the Coalition 
  does not charge Medicare beneficiaries for any Medicare-covered services. The 
  Coalition anticipates that no more than ten percent of its total patient population 
  will be Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
<p>If a clinician determines that a patient is not suitable for long-term psychoanalytic 
  treatment after a four to six session evaluation (e.g., the patient needs hospitalization 
  or treatment for drug or alcohol addiction), the Coalition suggests that the 
  patient obtain services from an alternative treatment resource. The Coalition 
  provides the patient with a list of such resources, but does not take further 
  steps to refer the patient (the Coalition does make a follow-up phone call to 
  the patient to try to ensure that the patient contacts an alternative treatment 
  provider). The top resource on the list is the community mental health clinic 
  for the catchment area in which the patient resides. The list does not include 
  any Participating Institutions, unless the patient was originally referred to 
  the Coalition from a Participating Institution, in which case the list may include 
  the Participating Institution.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> </p>
<p>The Coalition anticipates making an average of two alternative treatment referrals 
  each year, even if the patient enrollment in the Arrangement is at capacity.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  The alternative treatment services are provided outside the scope of the Arrangement, 
  and providers of such services may bill third-party insurers, including Medicare 
  and Medicaid. </p>
<p>Currently, there are no more than twenty patients enrolled on an on-going basis. 
  <a
name="total # patients"></a>The Coalition estimates that it will serve approximately 
  forty to fifty patients each year.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> The Coalition 
  publicizes the availability of the Arrangement (primarily through word-of-mouth) 
  to prospective patients and to other programs that may be interested in the 
  Arrangement, such as university counseling centers, research programs, and employee 
  assistance programs. Services are provided to patients at the clinicians' own 
  offices. </p>
<p>The Coalition's costs of administering the Arrangement are funded through a 
  mix of patient fee payments, various grant sources, and funding from its supporting 
  foundation. Even at full capacity, the Coalition projects an operating loss 
  for the Arrangement of approximately $[Y] per month. </p>
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: </p>
<p>&quot;Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] 
  any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony.&quot; </p>
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; 
  transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or 
  indirectly, covertly or overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated safe harbor regulations 
  that define practices that are not subject to the anti-kickback statute because 
  such practices would be unlikely to result in fraud or abuse. <u>See</u> 42 
  C.F.R. § 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, if met, 
  assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the arrangement 
  qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection is afforded 
  only to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions set forth 
  in the safe harbor. The regulatory safe harbor potentially applicable to the 
  Arrangement protects certain referral services, 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(f). However, 
  based on the facts presented, the Arrangement is not a referral service; rather, 
  through the Arrangement, the Coalition provides clinical services for which 
  it collects fees from patients. </p>
<p>The Arrangement raises concerns under the anti-kickback statute to the extent 
  that the Participating Institutions may be providing free clinical services 
  to the Coalition as a means of generating referrals of alternative treatment 
  mental health business that they can bill to a Federal health care program. 
  The OIG's position on the provision of free or below market value goods or services 
  to potential referral sources is longstanding and clear: the provision of free 
  goods or services to an actual or potential referral source may violate the 
  anti-kickback statute, depending on the circumstances. For example, the preamble 
  to the 1991 safe harbor regulations explains that giving free goods that have 
  an independent value to a physician may violate the anti-kickback statute. <u>See</u> 
  56 Fed. Reg. 35978 (July 29, 1991); <u>see also</u> Special Fraud Alert, 59 
  Fed. Reg. 65372, 65377 (Dec. 19, 1994); OIG Advisory Opinion 98-16. This analysis 
  generally applies to the provision of any free or below market value goods or 
  services to actual or potential referral sources. If the requisite intent to 
  induce or reward referrals of Federal health care program business is present, 
  the anti-kickback statute is violated. </p>
<p>In addition, we generally have heightened concerns about abuses in the area 
  of mental health services, where medical necessity determinations are often 
  subjective and the risk of overutilization is substantial. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 
  Review of Partial Hospitalization Services Provided Through Community Mental 
  Health Centers (A-04-98-02146; 10/98). </p>
<p>Notwithstanding, based on the totality of the facts presented, we conclude 
  that the Arrangement poses a minimal risk of Federal health care program or 
  patient fraud or abuse given the small number of patients enrolled at any given 
  time, the limited number of anticipated alternative treatment source referrals, 
  and the fact that no Federal health care programs are billed for services provided 
  under the Arrangement. Moreover, the Participating Institutions have a legitimate 
  business purpose for participating in the Arrangement, namely that the Arrangement 
  affords them additional training opportunities for their advanced psychiatric 
  residents. Finally, the Arrangement potentially offers a significant community 
  benefit through increased access to mental health services for lower income 
  community residents. </p>
<p>For these reasons, we would not impose sanctions on the Coalition for violations 
  of the anti-kickback statute in connection with the Arrangement. In addition, 
  we would not impose sanctions arising under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act (the 
  civil money penalty provision prohibiting inducements to beneficiaries to influence 
  their selection of providers of Medicare or Medicaid covered services), because 
  the Coalition does not provide any services for which it -- or anyone else -- 
  bills Medicare or Medicaid. </p>
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude (i) that the Arrangement would 
  potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on 
  the totality of the facts present in the Arrangement as described and certified 
  in the request letter and supplemental submissions, the OIG will not subject 
  the Coalition to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute under 
  sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act; and (ii) that the OIG will not 
  subject the Coalition to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection 
  with the Arrangement as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental 
  submissions. </p>
<p><strong>IV. LIMITATIONS</strong> </p>
<p>The limitations applicable to this opinion include the following: 
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is issued only to the Coalition, the requester of 
    this opinion. This advisory opinion has no application to, and cannot be relied 
    upon by, any other individual or entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion may not be introduced into evidence in any matter 
    involving an entity or individual that is not a requester to this opinion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above in the first paragraph of this opinion. No opinion is herein expressed 
    or implied with respect to the application of any other Federal, state, or 
    local statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, or other law that may be applicable 
    to the Arrangement.</li>
  <li>This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
  <li>No opinion is expressed herein regarding the liability of any party under 
    the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, 
    claims submission, cost reporting, or related conduct. </li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. </p>
<p>The OIG will not proceed against the requester with respect to any action that 
  is part of the Arrangement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion 
  as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and accurately 
  presented, and the Arrangement in practice comports with the information provided. 
  The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions and issues raised in 
  this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, rescind, modify, 
  or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion is modified 
  or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the requester with respect to 
  any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, where all 
  of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented, and 
  where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely, and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>/s/ </p>
<p>D. McCarty Thornton </p>
<p>Chief Counsel to the Inspector General <br>
  <br>

<p>FOOTNOTES: </p>
<p>1. Any qualified psychiatrist may participate in the Arrangement, although 
  most clinicians are expected to be psychiatric residents. <a name="N_2_"></a></p>
<p>2. The Coalition discloses to patients the Participating Institutions' affiliation 
  with the Arrangement and makes the five disclosures to patients enumerated in 
  42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(f)(4). Although disclosures of this type are insufficient 
  to guard against Federal health care program abuses, effective disclosures offer 
  some protection against possible abuses of patient trust. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>
<p>3. Any substantial increase in the number of referrals, particularly referrals 
  to the Participating Institutions, could constitute a material change of fact 
  and render this advisory opinion without force and effect. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>
<p>4. If the Coalition perceives that the community's needs exceed its twenty-patient 
  capacity, the Coalition may consider expanding the Arrangement. Any substantial 
  increase in enrollment could constitute a material change of fact and render 
  this advisory opinion without force and effect. <a name="N_5_"></a></p>
<p>5. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. </p>
