<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-9</strong> </p>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion about a 
  proposed contractual arrangement between a self-insured employer health plan 
  and a single-specialty managed care organization to provide managed podiatry 
  benefits for the employer's retirees (the &quot;Proposed Arrangement&quot;). 
  Specifically, you have inquired whether the Proposed Arrangement would constitute 
  grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the 
  Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), or under the civil money penalty 
  provision for inducements to beneficiaries, section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, 
  in the circumstances presented. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided and subject to certain conditions described 
  below, we conclude that (i) the Proposed Arrangement could involve prohibited 
  remuneration under section 1128B(b) of the Act, if the requisite intent to induce 
  referrals were present, but that the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) 
  will not impose sanctions on Corporation A, pursuant to the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Arrangement; and (ii) the OIG will not subject Corporation A to sanctions under 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. 
</p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Corporation A, 
  the requester of this opinion, and is further qualified as set out in Part V 
  below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. </p>
<p><strong>I. BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A. Corporation A</strong> </p>
<p>Corporation A, (the &quot;Plan&quot;) is a State X corporation in the business 
  since [year redacted] of providing specialized management of podiatry benefits 
  for self-insured employer plans. The Plan is licensed in State X as a health 
  care alternative financing and delivery system. As such, its operations are 
  subject to regulation under the State X HMO Act by the State X Insurance Bureau 
  and the State X Department of Community Health. The Plan is not owned or controlled 
  by podiatrists or any organization affiliated with podiatrists, nor are there 
  podiatrists on the Plan's Board of Directors. The Plan employs podiatrists as 
  medical directors. </p>
<p>The Plan has provided Corporation B (now known as [name redacted]) (the &quot;Employer&quot;) 
  with managed podiatry benefits for its employees for over sixteen years (the 
  &quot;Employee Program&quot;).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> As a result 
  of the Employee Program, the Employer has experienced significant cost savings 
  and reductions in abuses related to podiatry benefits, including overutilization 
  and inappropriate treatment. For example, the Employer has represented that 
  it saved $3.4 million in health care benefits related to foot care in one state 
  during the first two years of the Employee Program and that it also experienced 
  significant reductions in disability and sick leave expenditures related to 
  foot care. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> </p>
<p>The Plan proposes entering into a new arrangement with the Employer to provide 
  similar managed podiatry benefits for the Employer's retirees (the &quot;Retiree 
  Program&quot; or the &quot;Proposed Arrangement&quot;). Most retirees covered 
  by the Employer's health plan are Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for 
  whom the Employer acts as a supplemental insurer, paying their Medicare deductibles 
  and copayments (collectively, &quot;Medicare cost-sharing&quot;) on a per-claim 
  basis. The Employer engages in little or no utilization review of such cost-sharing 
  claims. Through the Retiree Program, the Employer anticipates reducing its expenditures 
  on Medicare cost-sharing for podiatry services, while simultaneously offering 
  retirees more covered podiatry benefits. The Retiree Program will be identical 
  to the Employee Program in all material respects, including the scope of covered 
  benefits and controls on utilization of services with the exception of the Retiree 
  Program's interplay with the Medicare Program (for which there is no Employee 
  Program counterpart) and the enhancement of the utilization review program as 
  discussed elsewhere in this letter. The Union has been, and remains, involved 
  in the decision to adopt the Retiree Program and in the related approval process. 
</p>
<p>Under the Proposed Arrangement, the Employer will pay the Plan annually a fixed, 
  capitated fee. The fee will reflect the Employer's historic annual expenditures 
  for Medicare cost-sharing, discounted by an amount estimated to reflect the 
  projected reduction in utilization of foot care services under the Retiree Program. 
</p>
<p>In exchange for this fee, the Plan will assume full financial risk for all 
  Medicare cost-sharing and all administrative costs in connection with the provision 
  of all medically necessary foot care services for the Employer's retirees, except 
  for inpatient facility services and services within the first seventy-two hours 
  related to accidental injuries (including fractures and sprains), which will 
  continue to be covered under the Employer's regular health insurance benefit. 
  In essence, the Plan will assume the Employer's role of supplemental insurer 
  for the retirees, thus taking on the obligation to pay Medicare cost-sharing 
  amounts to individual providers. </p>
<p>The Plan contracts with a network of approximately 3,300 credentialed podiatrists 
  and other physicians and providers nationwide (the &quot;Network Providers&quot;), 
  most of whom will be required to participate in both the Employee and Retiree 
  Programs.<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Network Providers will participate in the 
  Retiree Program pursuant to one-year written contracts. In establishing the 
  financial terms of the Retiree Program, neither the Plan nor the Network Providers 
  have given or received, or will give or receive, a discount on the Employee 
  Program's financial terms. </p>
<p>The Plan will pay the Medicare cost-sharing amounts on a per-claim basis for 
  all non-routine professional services, and all outpatient facility services, 
  treatment by subspecialists, anesthesiology, and other specialized or supplemental 
  services, bone scans, and other diagnostic tests (except x-rays) (the &quot;Retained-Risk&quot; 
  services) to the extent they are covered by Medicare.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>The Plan will also pay Network Providers a capitated amount per enrollee that 
  will cover any Medicare cost-sharing for routine professional podiatric services 
  (i.e., Medicare reimbursable podiatric services other than the Retained-Risk 
  services), as well as additional services which are not typically covered by 
  Medicare. These additional services include routine office visits, preventive 
  care, and orthotics (the &quot;Additional Services&quot;). With respect to Medicare-reimbursable 
  services covered by the capitated amount, the Network Providers will bill Medicare 
  on a fee-for-service basis and accept the capitation in lieu of collecting Medicare 
  cost-sharing amounts from the Employer or the retirees. The Network Providers 
  will be required to submit to the Plan's utilization control mechanisms for 
  services payable by the Medicare program. </p>
<p>The Plan will assign retirees to Network Providers on a geographical basis, 
  allocating them among Network Providers within zip code areas. A retiree will 
  be able to obtain services from a provider other than his or her assigned Network 
  Provider, including providers outside the network, but would then be responsible 
  for paying Medicare cost-sharing amounts up to an out-of-pocket maximum.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  The Plan will pay Medicare cost-sharing amounts over the out-of-pocket maximum 
  in full. Retirees who reside more than twenty-five miles from the nearest Network 
  Provider will be allowed to obtain services out-of-network at no cost to the 
  retiree. </p>
<p><strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement's UR/QA Program</strong> </p>
<p>The Plan's extensive utilization review and quality assurance programs for 
  the Employee Program (collectively, the &quot;UR/QA program&quot;) will be expanded 
  to apply equally to the Retiree Program. The UR/QA program consists of two parts: 
  a pre-certification requirement applicable to surgeries and referrals to hospitals 
  or outpatient surgery centers and an &quot;adjudication system&quot; for routine 
  office visits and preventive care services. </p>
<p>The pre-certification procedure for surgeries and referrals to hospitals or 
  outpatient surgery centers uses medical necessity guidelines developed by the 
  Plan. If a provider or patient disagrees with a pre-certification determination, 
  a peer review procedure is in place that includes review by a panel of independent 
  physicians and podiatrists, whose determination is honored. Under the Retiree 
  Program, Network Providers will not be allowed to bill Medicare for any covered 
  foot care service for which pre-certification is required but not obtained.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  Network Providers must also participate in certain other quality of care and 
  educational programs designed to detect and correct patterns of overutilization 
  or other inappropriate practices. In addition, the Plan is considering establishing 
  a funds withholding and risk pool arrangement as an additional incentive to 
  Network Providers to cooperate with the pre-certification requirements and the 
  restrictions on billing Medicare. </p>
<p>The second component of the UR/QA program -- the &quot;adjudication system&quot; 
  -- applies to services that are not subject to pre-certification, primarily 
  services provided during routine office visits. Under the adjudication system, 
  Network Providers submit monthly encounter data reports, which are reviewed 
  by the Plan's management, including its medical director. The utilization reports 
  identify utilization rates for all procedures, including those for which the 
  Network Providers are at risk under the capitation. The Plan uses the encounter 
  data to identify Network Providers whose use of a procedure is significantly 
  above or below the median utilization of the procedure by all Network Providers, 
  using statistically valid methods and taking into account geographical considerations 
  and recognized medical standards. </p>
<p>The Plan employs a system of random audits and surveys to verify compliance 
  with the UR/QA program. In addition, the Plan randomly selects 100 claims each 
  month for review of clerical accuracy, CPT code accuracy, medical necessity, 
  and appropriateness of care. The Plan will make available to the Health Care 
  Financing Administration, upon request, all records relating to these audits 
  and surveys, as well as other utilization and quality control information in 
  connection with the Retiree Program. </p>
<p>Network Providers identified by the Plan as significantly under- or overutilizing 
  a procedure are subject to counseling, corrective action, or dismissal from 
  the network. The enforcement process consists of education and counseling, a 
  probationary period during which the Network Provider's data is monitored, and, 
  if the Network Provider fails to adhere to reasonable norms, termination of 
  his or her contract. For the period from January 1997 until April 1999, the 
  Plan counseled a total of eighty-eight Network Providers and terminated twenty-one 
  for overutilization. In particular, four Network Providers were terminated for 
  overutilization of services covered solely by the Plan's capitated payment, 
  even though the Plan incurred no financial loss. </p>
<p>In combination, the pre-certification and adjudication systems will subject 
  virtually all Medicare-covered services to utilization review. To ensure effective 
  review of Medicare-covered services, the UR/QA program will be applied identically 
  in the Employee and Retiree Programs and &quot;blinded&quot; so that reviewing 
  personnel will not know whether the patient is an employee -- for whom the Employer 
  pays under the Employee Program -- or a retiree -- for whom Medicare is primarily 
  at risk. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>To further protect the Medicare program from provider attempts to circumvent 
  the UR/QA program, the Plan will obtain information from fiscal intermediaries 
  about procedures performed by Network Providers and billed to Medicare. The 
  Plan will conduct random utilization management audits of the information to 
  identify any Network Providers who are not submitting encounter reports for 
  all procedures performed on Medicare enrollees or who are not cooperating with 
  the pre-certification requirements. The information will also be used to identify 
  charts to be pulled in random audits. The confidentiality of patient records 
  will be protected. </p>
<p>Finally, the Plan plans to develop guidelines applicable to procedures for 
  which pre-certification will not be required under the Retiree Program, but 
  that are subject to abuse or should be monitored for other reasons. For example, 
  independent of the Proposed Arrangement, the Plan is developing a guideline 
  for conservative treatment of mycotic toenails, an area the Plan has identified 
  as problematic in the Employee Program and an area that has led to abuses in 
  the Medicare program. </p>
<p><strong>D. Medicare Reimbursement</strong> </p>
<p>Medically necessary foot care services are covered under Part A and Part B 
  of Medicare; however, routine foot care services are generally excluded from 
  coverage, as are most orthopedic shoes and other supportive devices. <u>See</u> 
  42 U.S.C. §§ 1395y(a)(8) &amp; (13). Limited orthotics are covered for some 
  diabetic patients. In addition, Medicare covers a limited number of routine 
  services, such as treatment of mycotic toenails, which are only covered when 
  a patient has a systemic disease of sufficient severity that unskilled performance 
  of such a procedure would be hazardous. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, Medicare Carriers 
  Manual § 4120.1. </p>
<p><strong>II. ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT POTENTIALLY IMPLICATES THE ANTI-KICKBACK 
  STATUTE</strong>, <strong>THE OIG WILL NOT IMPOSE SANCTIONS.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A. Law</strong> </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>There are several statutory exceptions and regulatory &quot;safe harbors&quot; 
  under the anti-kickback statute. As a threshold matter, the Proposed Arrangement 
  is not protected by the exception to the anti-kickback statute for certain risk-sharing 
  arrangements, section 1128B(b)(3)(F) of the Act. Although similar in some respects 
  to managed care arrangements addressed by that exception, the Proposed Arrangement 
  will not be implemented pursuant to a contract with Medicare or a State health 
  care program, nor will the Plan or its providers be put at substantial financial 
  risk for the cost or utilization of items or services provided to Federal health 
  care program beneficiaries. Similarly, the Proposed Arrangement does not come 
  within the definition of a protected health plan under the existing regulatory 
  safe harbor for increased coverage, reduced cost-sharing amounts, or reduced 
  premium amounts offered by health plans, 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(<em>l</em>), which 
  requires that a protected health plan have a contract with the Health Care Financing 
  Administration. </p>
<p>The OIG's concern about the potential for fraud and abuse arising from the 
  routine waiver of Medicare cost-sharing amounts is longstanding. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 
  Preamble to Final Rule on Safe Harbors for Protecting Health Plans, 61 Fed. 
  Reg. 2122, 2124 (Jan. 25, 1996); Special Fraud Alert: Routine Waiver of Copayments 
  or Deductibles Under Medicare Part B, 59 Fed. Reg. 35373, 35374 (Dec. 19, 1994).<strong> 
  </strong>Such waivers undermine the important utilization and cost control functions 
  of the cost-sharing requirement. </p>
<p>We have also previously articulated our concern that agreements between providers 
  and health plans to forgo cost-sharing amounts may result in kickbacks from 
  providers to health care plans in exchange for referrals of Federal program 
  business. For example, the preamble to the 1996 Final Rule establishing certain 
  managed care safe harbors explained that: </p>
<p>&quot;[t]he [anti-kickback] statute prohibits any remuneration which is in 
  return for, or which is designed to induce, the flow of Medicare and Medicaid 
  program-related business. Therefore, it could cover a hospital's agreement to 
  forego or reduce coinsurance or deductibles in exchange for increased program-related 
  business. It does not matter that the payment is made to a third party rather 
  than the beneficiary.&quot; 61 Fed. Reg. 2124; <u>see also</u> OIG Advisory 
  Opinion 98-5 (Apr. 17, 1998). </p>
<p><strong>B. Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>The principal issue raised by the Proposed Arrangement is whether, in exchange 
  for the Employer's retiree business, the Plan and its Network Providers will 
  be giving the Employer a discount on the Medicare copayment obligation the Employer 
  would otherwise have to satisfy on behalf of its Medicare-eligible retirees. 
  Since a reduction in an amount legally owed confers a financial benefit on the 
  party receiving the reduction, full or partial waivers of Medicare copayment 
  obligations used to attract business have long been suspect under the anti-kickback 
  statute. </p>
<p>The Proposed Arrangement is similar in some respects to the arrangement that 
  raised substantial concerns under the anti-kickback statute in OIG Advisory 
  Opinion 98-5. In that arrangement, a nursing home entered into an agreement 
  with a health care plan to accept the health care plan's per diem amount as 
  payment in full for services rendered to all plan members, including retirees 
  for whom Medicare was the primary payer and the plan was only secondarily liable. 
  For those plan members who were Medicare beneficiaries, the contractual arrangement 
  effectively required the nursing home to forgo certain Medicare cost-sharing 
  amounts that the health care plan would otherwise have had to pay on behalf 
  of its retiree beneficiaries. We concluded that the arrangement potentially 
  violated the anti-kickback statute. </p>
<p>One of our concerns about the arrangement in OIG Advisory Opinion 98-5 was 
  that the nursing home's willingness to forgo cost-sharing revenue was, in essence, 
  a price concession offered to the health plan in exchange for the opportunity 
  to treat the health plan's Medicare population. By releasing the health plan 
  from its obligation to pay the Medicare copayment, the arrangement posed an 
  increased risk of overutilization and increased program costs by eliminating 
  the health plan's financial incentive to control the level and intensity of 
  health care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. In effect, the nursing 
  home agreed to provide care to plan members paid for by the plan at a low price 
  (including savings on copayments) in exchange for referrals of Medicare beneficiaries 
  paid for by Medicare. <u>See</u> <u>also</u> OIG Advisory Opinion 99-2 (Feb. 
  26, 1999). </p>
<p>The Proposed Arrangement is different from the suspect arrangement in OIG Advisory 
  Opinion 98-5. Most importantly, the Employer will pay the full amount of its 
  projected copayment obligation for podiatry services for its retirees. Similarly, 
  the contracted Network Providers, in the aggregate, will receive their full 
  anticipated copayment amounts minus only an amount to fund the Plan's operating 
  expenses. In other words, there may be no waiver of any Employer copayment obligation. 
</p>
<p>A key to determining the adequacy of the Employer's payment is an assessment 
  of the effectiveness of the Plan's management of the podiatric network and services. 
  Many utilization review and quality assurance activities are of questionable 
  benefit in controlling unnecessary utilization and containing health care costs. 
  For example, many programs are of the &quot;pay-and-chase&quot; variety, reviewing 
  utilization either retrospectively or concurrently (rather than prospectively). 
  Moreover, most utilization programs rely primarily on identifying providers 
  with aberrant utilization patterns (i.e., extreme outliers compared to other 
  providers); these programs do not address the situation of a physician or physicians 
  routinely providing medically unnecessary care without exceeding the &quot;aberrant&quot; 
  threshold. For these and other reasons, utilization review programs have limited 
  effectiveness as fraud and abuse controls. </p>
<p>There is substantial evidence, however, that the Proposed Arrangement's UR/QA 
  program offers meaningful review. For example: 
<ul>
  <li>The identical program (i.e., the Employee Program) has been in effect for 
    over sixteen years and has been effective in reducing utilization among the 
    Employer's active workers. Accordingly, the Employer has a reasonable historical 
    experience with virtually the identical program upon which to assess anticipated 
    utilization and corresponding copayment obligations. </li>
  <li>The review process will be blinded so that services provided to Medicare 
    retirees will be reviewed in the same manner and subject to the same standards 
    as services provided to employees for whom the Employer is fully liable under 
    the Employee Program.</li>
  <li>Virtually all of the Retained-Risk services billed to Medicare (accounting 
    for approximately 70% of Medicare's dollar volume for podiatry services) will 
    be subject to pre-certification. In other words, the medical necessity of 
    these services will be evaluated prospectively based on the particular circumstances 
    of each case.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The program has an established record in tracking, monitoring, and disciplining 
    podiatrists who fail to adhere to the UR/QA program guidelines and protocols, 
    even in circumstances where the Plan has not been at-risk for the cost of 
    the services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Because the Plan is not a provider-sponsored or controlled organization, 
    it has an arms-length relationship with its Network Providers and no incentive 
    to manipulate the UR/QA system to benefit them.</li>
  <li>The pre-certification protocols and the additional guideline for mycotic 
    toenails have been reviewed and approved for appropriateness by an outside 
    expert pursuant to the provisions of 42 C.F.R. § 1008.33.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In light of these characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude that (i) the 
  Proposed Arrangement is likely to result in a reduction in unnecessary podiatry 
  services and (ii) the Employer payment to the Plan will substantially approximate 
  its applicable copayment obligation in the aggregate. </p>
<p>Moreover, even if some part of the copayment obligation would be waived, we 
  would not impose sanctions on the Plan in connection with such waiver in light 
  of the overall structure of the UR/QA program, the fact that the Proposed Arrangement 
  is very likely to result in a reduction in Federal health care expenditures, 
  and the potential for increased benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
<p>Simply put, for every dollar that the Employer saves in Medicare copayments 
  through elimination of unnecessary foot care for retirees, the Federal government 
  saves four dollars. Thus, even if the copayment match is only roughly approximate, 
  the Proposed Arrangement is likely to confer a substantial financial benefit 
  on the Federal fisc as the primary beneficiary of the Plan's management of the 
  foot care benefit. </p>
<p>In addition, the Proposed Arrangement is likely to benefit Federal beneficiaries 
  through access to expanded insurance coverage for the Additional Services. The 
  Proposed Arrangement preserves freedom of choice for Medicare beneficiaries 
  through the out-of-network alternative, which permits retirees to select any 
  provider. Retiree interests are further protected through the participation 
  of the Union as a collective bargaining agent. </p>
<p>Finally, the Proposed Arrangement preserves the primary purpose of Medicare 
  copayments as a check on unnecessary utilization. Copayments encourage responsible 
  use of health care services by giving beneficiaries a financial stake in their 
  health care. This function is undermined when beneficiaries obtain supplemental 
  insurance coverage for cost-sharing amounts through employer plans or Medigap 
  policies, since those beneficiaries have no financial incentive to reduce utilization. 
  Like the Employer under its current practice, most employer plans and Medigap 
  insurers engage in little or no utilization review of Medicare copayment claims 
  since such review is not cost effective given the plans' relatively limited 
  financial exposure for any given service. By establishing a Retiree Program 
  comparable to its existing Employee Program, the Employer will be using its 
  cost-sharing dollars for their intended purpose: to encourage efficient and 
  judicious use of foot care services paid for by Medicare. </p>
<p>We recognize that, despite the safeguards incorporated into the Proposed Arrangement, 
  there may be &quot;rogue&quot; providers who bill for medically unnecessary 
  services, upcode claims, bill for services not provided, or engage in similar 
  illegal activities. Nothing in this advisory opinion protects such providers 
  or activities or limits the OIG's ability to enforce the Federal anti-fraud 
  and abuse authorities against such unscrupulous providers. </p>
<p><strong>III. THE OIG WILL NOT SUBJECT THE PLAN TO CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES UNDER 
  SECTION 1128A(a)(5) OF THE ACT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT.</strong> 
</p>
<p>A further question arises as to whether the Additional Services provided to 
  Medicare beneficiaries violate section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, which prohibits 
  a person from offering or transferring remuneration to a beneficiary that such 
  person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order 
  items or services from a particular provider or supplier for which payment may 
  be made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Plan will offer the Additional 
  Services to retirees to induce them to use the managed services network generally. 
  All Network Providers will offer the Additional Services, and thus the services 
  will not be an incentive to choose a particular provider within the network. 
  For these reasons, the OIG will not subject the Plan to sanctions under section 
  1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. </p>
<p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>For the above-stated reasons and based on the facts as certified in the request 
  letter and supplemental submissions, we conclude that (i) the Proposed Arrangement 
  could involve prohibited remuneration under section 1128B(b) of the Act, if 
  the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the OIG will 
  not impose sanctions on the requester pursuant to the anti-kickback statute 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the 
  Proposed Arrangement; and (ii) the OIG will not subject the Plan to sanctions 
  under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. 
</p>

<p>1. The Employer sponsors health plans for its employees and retirees pursuant 
  to collective bargaining agreements with Union Y (the &quot;Union&quot;). <a name="N_2_"></a></p>
<p>2. There are limited exceptions for certain providers who do not wish to participate 
  in the Retiree Program, but who are needed to provide adequate coverage under 
  the Employee Program in areas with few alternative providers. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>
<p>3. The Retained-Risk services include most of the procedures described in the 
  top twenty Medicare procedure codes shown on the State X Medicare Part B Procedure 
  Code Analysis by Speciality (#48-Podiatry) published by the Health Care Service 
  Corporation and submitted by the Plan, accounting for approximately 74% of Medicare's 
  dollar volume relating to procedures that may be performed by podiatrists. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>
<p>4. The amount of the out-of-pocket maximum will be subject to the Union's concurrence. 
  <a name="N_5_"></a></p>
<p>5. The Plan currently has pre-certification requirements and guidelines in 
  place for approximately 325 of the 500 procedure codes for which Medicare will 
  pay podiatrists, or approximately 65% of the total number of applicable Medicare 
  codes. The remaining codes are primarily for routine care, office visits, and 
  preventive care, many of which are not covered by Medicare. Using existing guidelines, 
  the Plan will control and pre-certify most of the procedures described in the 
  top twenty Medicare podiatry procedure codes, accounting for approximately 74% 
  of Medicare's dollar volume relating to procedures that may be performed by 
  podiatrists. The guidelines will be expanded over the next two years to cover 
  all of the top twenty codes and substantially all of the top fifty (which account 
  for 91.6% of total Medicare dollars paid for podiatry services). <u>See</u> 
  State X Medicare Part B Procedure Code Analysis by Speciality (#48-Podiatry).

<p>6. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a
name="N_7_"></a></p>
<p>7. In reviewing the Plan's UR/QA program for purposes of this advisory opinion, 
  we looked at whether the program was likely to be effective in reducing utilization 
  and whether it would be likely to result in denials of medically necessary care. 
  Determinations made by the Plan or the UR/QA program with respect to a Network 
  Provider's utilization are not, and will not be, binding on the OIG in any enforcement 
  action. </p>
