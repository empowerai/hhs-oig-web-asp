  <strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-13</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Dear [name redacted]: <br>
  <br>
  We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  certain arrangements for discounted pathology services provided to physicians 
  (the &quot;Proposed Arrangement&quot;). You have asked whether the Proposed 
  Arrangement would result in prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) or 
  would constitute grounds for the imposition of sanctions under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the exclusion authority related to kickbacks, 
  section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, 
  section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. In addition, you have asked whether the Proposed 
  Arrangement would constitute grounds for a permissive exclusion for charging 
  Medicare or Medicaid substantially in excess of the usual charges, section 1128(b)(6)(A) 
  of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Arrangement might constitute prohibited remuneration under 
  the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal 
  health care program business were present and might be subject to sanctions 
  arising under sections 1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, as 
  well as grounds for a permissive exclusion under section 1128(b)(6)(A) of the 
  Act. <br>
  <br>
  This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the addressee and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
</p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. [Company A]</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Company A is a State X professional corporation with three shareholders, all 
  of whom are specialists in pathology and are licensed to practice medicine in 
  State X. Company A employs five pathologists and fourteen technicians. It provides 
  pathology services (including clinical and anatomic pathology services)<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  to five hospitals, as well as to the patients of physicians in private practice. 
</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>B. Billing Procedures</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Company A has several billing methodologies depending upon the payor. For Federal 
  health care program patients, Company A bills its charges to the government 
  payor and bills the patients for any applicable copayments or deductibles. <br>
  <br>
  For non-Federal health care program patients, referring physicians have two 
  payment options. One option is for Company A to bill its charges directly to 
  the applicable third-party payor, and bill the patients for any copayments or 
  deductibles. The alternative is for Company A to bill the physicians for the 
  pathology services and accept that payment as payment in full. The physicians 
  then bill the third-party payors and patients for the purchased pathology services. 
  This option is commonly referred to as &quot;account billing&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  Under its account billing arrangements, Company A has traditionally offered 
  physicians a discount off its usual charges which reflects the cost savings 
  it realizes. Company A generates a single monthly statement to the referring 
  physician who is required to pay on a prompt basis. Company A has represented 
  that an account billing arrangement saves time and expense because: (i) claims 
  are not submitted to a wide range of payors; (ii) Company A need not consider 
  the claims submission criteria of the various payors; and (iii) Company A is 
  not responsible for determining and collecting applicable copayments and deductibles 
  owed by the patients. In addition, Company A realizes a better collection rate 
  under account billing. Most physicians who have an account billing arrangement 
  with Company A refer virtually all of their patients to Company A, whether the 
  patients' specimens are covered under the account billing arrangement or are 
  directly billed to the Federal health care programs.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>C. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Under the Proposed Arrangement, Company A will offer its account billing customers 
  discounts that are greater than its cost savings, in order to match the prices 
  of its competitors. Some of the discounted charges will be below the actual 
  cost of providing the pathology services. In addition, Company A's profit margin 
  for the non-Federal health care program business under the Proposed Arrangement 
  would be less than the profit margin on the services that it bills directly 
  to Federal health care programs. The discount will not be conditioned upon the 
  physicians sending Company A its Federal health care program business. However, 
  Company A has assumed that the physicians receiving discounts under the Proposed 
  Arrangement will send virtually all of their patients to Company A. If Company 
  A does not match the discounts of its competitors, Company A has represented 
  that it will lose both the account billing business and the Federal health care 
  program business of those clients. <br>
</p>
<p><strong>II.</strong> <strong>LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>A. The Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. See section 1128B(b) 
  of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals of items 
  or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback statute 
  is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties on both 
  sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. For purposes of 
  the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; includes the transfer of 
  anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
</p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose 
  of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to induce 
  further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); 
  <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 
  474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony punishable 
  by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years or both. Conviction 
  will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, including 
  Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal health care programs or to impose civil monetary 
  penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities under sections 
  1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>1. Special Fraud Alert Relating to Arrangements for the Provision of 
  Clinical Laboratory Services</strong> <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, we issued a Special Fraud Alert describing certain laboratory practices 
  that implicated the anti-kickback statute. The Special Fraud Alert set forth 
  our analysis that when a laboratory offers or gives to a referral source anything 
  of value for less than fair market value, an inference may be made that the 
  thing of value is offered to induce the referral of business. Specifically, 
  we gave the example of laboratories waiving charges for laboratory tests to 
  physicians for managed care patients, in order to retain the high-paying non-managed 
  care business. In that example, the free laboratory services for managed care 
  patients could be a kickback between the laboratory and the physician for the 
  fee-for-service patients. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. The Discount Exception and Safe Harbor</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute contains a statutory exception for &quot;a discount 
  or other reduction in price obtained by a provider of services or other entity 
  under a Federal health care program if the reduction in price is properly disclosed 
  and appropriately reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider 
  or entity under a Federal health care program.&quot; Section 1128B(b)(3)(A) 
  of the Act. This discount exception reflects the intent of Congress to encourage 
  price competition that benefits the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Department 
  of Health and Human Services has published regulations implementing this discount 
  &quot;safe harbor&quot; exception. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(h). <br>
  <br>
  To determine whether Company A's proposed discount practice implicates the anti-kickback 
  statute, we must determine whether the Proposed Arrangement fits within the 
  discount safe harbor. We conclude that the Proposed Arrangement does not fit 
  within the safe harbor. The statutory exception for discounts, as implemented 
  by the regulatory safe harbor, does not protect price reductions -- like those 
  at issue here -- offered to one payor but not offered to Medicare or Medicaid. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(h)(3)(iii). <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the preamble to the discount safe harbor illustrated the potential 
  problem with laboratory price reductions: <br>
  <br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>[W]e are aware of cases where laboratories offer a discount to physicians 
    who then bill the patient, but do not offer the same discount to the Medicare 
    program. In some of these cases, the discount offered to the physician is 
    explicitly conditioned on the physician's referral of all of his or her laboratory 
    business. Such a &quot;discount&quot; does not benefit Medicare, and is therefore 
    inconsistent with the statutory intent for discounts to be reported to the 
    programs with costs and charges reduced appropriately to reflect the discounts. 
    56 Fed. Reg. 35977 (July 29, 1991). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such price reductions create a risk that a laboratory may be offering remuneration 
  in the form of discounts on business for which the purchaser pays the laboratory, 
  in exchange for the opportunity to service and bill for higher paying Federal 
  health care program business reimbursed directly by the program to the laboratory. 
  In such circumstances, neither Medicare nor Medicaid benefits from the discount; 
  to the contrary, Medicare and Medicaid may, in effect, subsidize the other payor's 
  discounted rates. Moreover, laboratories may have an incentive to engage in 
  abusive billing practices to recoup losses on the discounted business. Accordingly, 
  the Proposed Arrangement does not fit in the discount safe harbor. <br>
  <br>
  Having concluded that the Proposed Arrangement does not fit in the safe harbor, 
  we must consider whether the discount arrangement between Company A and physicians 
  utilizing account billing under the Proposed Arrangement may involve illegal 
  remuneration to the physicians for their referrals of Federal health care program 
  business not covered by the account billing arrangement and not subject to the 
  discount. We conclude that it may. <br>
  <br>
  The circumstances surrounding the Proposed Arrangement suggest that a nexus 
  may exist between the discount to the physicians for non-Federal health care 
  program business and referrals of Federal health care program business. <u>First</u>, 
  the physicians are in a position to direct a significant amount of Federal health 
  care program business to Company A that is not covered by the account billing 
  component of the Proposed Arrangement. <u>Second</u>, both parties have obvious 
  motives for agreeing to trade business: the physicians have the opportunity 
  to make a larger profit on the non-Federal health care program business, and 
  Company A is able to secure profitable Federal health care program business 
  in a highly competitive market. <u>Third</u>, Company A has represented that 
  it is likely that physicians who have account billing arrangements with Company 
  A will refer Federal health care program business to Company A as a matter of 
  practical convenience. <br>
  <br>
  In evaluating whether an improper nexus exists between a discount and referrals 
  of Federal business in a particular arrangement, neither the size nor structure 
  of the discount is determinative of an anti-kickback violation. Rather, the 
  appropriate question to ask is whether the discount -- regardless of its size 
  or structure -- is tied or linked directly or indirectly to referrals of other 
  Federal health care program business. Evidence that the discount is not commercially 
  reasonable in the absence of other, non-discounted business is highly probative. 
  In this regard, discounts on account billing business that are particularly 
  suspect include, but are not limited to: 
<ul>
  <li>discounted prices that are below the laboratory's cost,<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
    and </li>
  <li>discounted prices that are lower than the prices that the laboratory offers 
    to a buyer that (i) generates a volume of business for the supplier that is 
    the same or greater than the volume of account billing business generated 
    by the physician, but (ii) does not have any potentially available Federal 
    health care program business. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an illustrative, not exhaustive, list of suspect discounts; other arrangements 
  may be equally suspect. Each of the above pricing arrangements independently 
  gives rise to an inference that the laboratory and the physicians may be &quot;swapping&quot; 
  discounts on account billing business in exchange for profitable non-discounted 
  Federal health care program business. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the facts presented here, we are unable to exclude the possibility 
  that Company A may be offering improper discounts under the Proposed Arrangement 
  with the intent to induce referrals of more lucrative Federal health care program 
  business. Nor are we able to exclude the possibility that the physicians may 
  be soliciting improper discounts on business for which they have the opportunity 
  to earn money in exchange for referrals of business for which they have no opportunity, 
  but for which the laboratories can receive additional revenue. Indeed, the Proposed 
  Arrangement poses a significant risk of such improper &quot;swapping&quot; of 
  business, especially in light of Company A's representation that many of its 
  competitors are agreeing to such discounts. These competitor discount arrangements 
  may similarly run afoul of the anti-kickback statute. The risk of improper &quot;swapping&quot; 
  is compounded by the likelihood that physicians will refer Federal health care 
  program business to their account billing laboratory as a matter of practical 
  convenience. <br>
</p>
<p><strong>B. Permissive Exclusion for Billing Medicare Substantially in Excess 
  of Usual Charges</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Price reductions offered to physicians that are not offered to Medicare or Medicaid 
  raise additional issues under section 1128(b)(6)(A) of the Act, which provides 
  for permissive exclusion from the Federal health care programs of individuals 
  or entities that submit or cause to be submitted bills or requests for payment 
  (based on charges or costs) under Medicare or Medicaid that are substantially 
  in excess of such individual's or entity's usual charges or costs, unless the 
  Secretary finds good cause for such bills or requests. In determining an individual's 
  or entity's &quot;usual&quot; charges, we will look at the amounts charged to 
  non-Federal payors, including physicians. If the charge to Medicare or Medicaid 
  substantially exceeds the amount the laboratory most frequently charges or has 
  contractually agreed to accept from non-Federal payors, the laboratory may be 
  subject to exclusion under section 1128(b)(6)(A) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  The limited information submitted by Company A is insufficient to make a determination 
  as to whether the Proposed Arrangement may run afoul of section 1128(b)(6)(A).<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III. CONCLUSION </strong></p>
<p>Based on the facts certified in the request for an advisory opinion and supplemental 
  submissions, we conclude that the Proposed Arrangement might constitute prohibited 
  remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce 
  referrals of Federal health care program business were present, and might be 
  subject to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 
  1128(b)(7), 1128A(a)(7), or 1128B(b) of the Act, and the permissive exclusion 
  provision under section 1128(b)(6)(A). <br>
