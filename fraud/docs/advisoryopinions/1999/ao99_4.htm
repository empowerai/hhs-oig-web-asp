<p><strong>Re: Advisory Opinion No. 99-4</strong> 
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether a proposed agreement (the "Proposed Agreement"), pursuant to 
  which Hospital District No.1 ("District One" or the "Requestor") would locate 
  a medical clinic within the geographic boundaries of Hospital District No. 2 
  ("District Two"), would constitute grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), the exclusion 
  authority for kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil monetary 
  penalty provisions for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary information, is true and correct, and constitutes 
  a complete description of the material facts regarding the Proposed Agreement. 
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  you presented to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of 
  such information. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion and supplemental 
  submissions, we conclude that the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not 
  subject the Requestor to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant 
  to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed 
  Agreement between District One and District Two. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Requestor and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part III below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>Under State A law, hospital districts may be organized within a county boundary 
  to provide health care services to the general public. <u>See</u> State A Code 
  &#167; [ ]. District One and District Two are hospital districts located in 
  County B, State A. District One owns and operates a public hospital and clinic 
  in City C, State A. District Two owns and previously operated a hospital and 
  clinic located in City D and City E, State A. District Two ceased operation 
  of its health care facilities on September 30, 1998. District Two does not currently 
  operate any health care facilities or provide any health care services.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>District One and District Two propose entering the Proposed Agreement (entitled 
  "Mutual Interagency Agreement For Physician Services") whereby District One 
  will locate a medical clinic (the "District One Clinic") within District Two's 
  hospital district.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Proposed Agreement 
  is subject to revocation at any time, with or without cause, on one year's notice 
  from District Two. District One will obtain office space for and staff the District 
  One Clinic without any financial support or participation from District Two. 
  District Two will not exercise operational control over the District One Clinic, 
  nor will District Two be entitled to any revenues from the District One Clinic. 
  Under the Proposed Agreement, no payments or other remuneration will be made 
  or exchanged between District One and District Two (other than District Two 
  authorizing District One to locate a clinic in District Two's hospital district). 
  District One has represented that there are no oral or other collateral agreements 
  or understandings between District One and District Two. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. 
<p>Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals of items or services 
  for which payment may be made by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes criminal liability to 
  parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything 
  of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>By granting District One an opportunity to locate its clinic in District Two's 
  district, District Two may be bestowing on District One something of value, 
  that is, an opportunity to generate business in District Two. Notwithstanding, 
  it is axiomatic that there can be no violation of the anti-kickback statute 
  absent a prohibited referral. On the facts stated, District One cannot refer 
  any health care business to District Two, because District Two does not operate 
  any health care facilities or provide any health care services. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in the request for an advisory opinion and supplemental 
  submissions, we conclude that the OIG will not subject the Requestor to sanctions 
  arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act in connection with the Proposed Agreement between District One and 
  Two.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

  <br>

  is part of the Proposed Agreement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory 
  opinion as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and 
  accurately presented, and the Proposed Agreement in practice comports with the 
  information provided. The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions 
  and issues raised in this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, 
  rescind, modify or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion 
  is modified or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the Requestor with 
  respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, 
  where all of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented 
  and where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely, and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG.

<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. This opinion is premised on the facts that District Two does not operate 
  any health care facilities and District Two does not provide any health care 
  services. If either of these facts change, this opinion is without force and 
  effect. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. Under State A law, a public agency may contract with another public agency 
  to perform services the first public agency is authorized by law to perform.
