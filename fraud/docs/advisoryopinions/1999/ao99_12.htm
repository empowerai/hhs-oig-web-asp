  <strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-12</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Dear [name redacted]: <br>
  <br>
  We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion about a proposed 
  marketing program involving the use of physician practices and health care clinics 
  to distribute coupons redeemable by certain retailers (including grocery stores, 
  pharmacies, and internet companies) for discounts on items or services that 
  are not reimbursable by any Federal health care program (the &quot;Proposed 
  Arrangement&quot;). Specifically, the question raised by your request is whether 
  the Proposed Arrangement constitutes grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), 
  or under the civil monetary penalty for inducements to beneficiaries, section 
  1128A(a)(5) of the Act, in the circumstances presented. <br>
  <br>
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the information provided, we conclude that, based on the totality of 
  the facts of the Proposed Arrangement (as described and certified in the request 
  letter and supplemental submissions), the Proposed Arrangement does not implicate 
  the anti-kickback statute and that the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) 
  will not subject Company A to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection 
  with the Proposed Arrangement, nor will the OIG impose civil monetary penalties 
  on Company A in connection with the Proposed Arrangement for violations of the 
  prohibition against inducements to beneficiaries under section 1128A(a)(5) of 
  the Act. <br>
  <br>
  This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Company A, the requester 
  of this opinion, and is further qualified as set out in Part V below and in 
  42 C.F.R. Part 1008. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Company A (&quot;Company A&quot;) is a closely-held State X corporation formed 
  for the purpose of marketing products related and unrelated to the delivery 
  of health care. Company A is not owned by, or affiliated with, any entity or 
  person involved in the health care business. Company A has developed the Proposed 
  Arrangement, a marketing program designed to increase customer traffic for participating 
  retailers through the distribution of discount coupons by physicians and health 
  care clinics. <br>
  <br>
  Under the Proposed Arrangement, Company A will contract with retailers, including 
  retail grocery stores, pharmacies, and internet companies (collectively, the 
  &quot;contracting retailers&quot;) to coordinate the printing and distribution 
  of coupons redeemable for discounts at the retailers. Some of these contracting 
  retailers will be involved in the delivery of health care items or services, 
  and some people who receive the coupons will be Federal health care program 
  beneficiaries who may purchase or order products or services from the contracting 
  retailer that are reimbursable under a Federal health care program (e.g., prescription 
  drugs payable by Medicaid). However, the coupons will not be valid for discounts 
  on any items or services reimbursable by a Federal health care program, nor 
  will their redemption be conditioned in any fashion on the purchase of any items 
  or services reimbursable by a Federal health care program; rather, the coupons 
  will offer discounts on non-prescription, over-the-counter products. The coupons 
  will be given to <em>all</em> individuals as they exit a clinic or physician's 
  office, irrespective of their insurance coverage or whether they are likely 
  to require covered items or services that the contracting retailer provides. 
  Coupon recipients will be free to use or discard the coupon. The coupons are 
  typically expected to be worth approximately $[x] and will not exceed $[y]. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Company A has represented that the fee for its marketing services will be a 
  fixed amount set in arms-length negotiations between Company A and each contracting 
  retailer, will represent fair market value for Company A's marketing services,<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or 
  value of any Federally-reimbursable business generated (directly or indirectly) 
  by the Proposed Arrangement. The fee paid by each contracting retailer will 
  cover all of Company A's costs associated with performance of the contract to 
  which the fee applies, including all costs associated with engaging physicians 
  and health care clinics to distribute the coupons. Accordingly, Company A has 
  a significant economic incentive to contain costs. <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account the retailers' preferences as to markets and geographic 
  location for the coupon distribution, Company A will enter into contracts with 
  health care clinics and physician groups in the relevant locations to distribute 
  the coupons. The length of the contracts will vary depending on the volume of 
  coupons to be distributed by the particular clinic or physician group (in some 
  cases the volume of coupons could be in the many thousands). <br>
  <br>
  Company A has represented that the fee to be paid to the physicians and clinics 
  will be fixed in arms-length transactions between Company A and the physicians 
  and clinics, will be a few cents per coupon (usually less than [z] cents), will 
  be set in advance (typically a fixed amount per coupon distributed), will represent 
  fair market value for the distribution services, and will not be determined 
  in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any Federally-reimbursable 
  business generated (directly or indirectly) by the Proposed Arrangement. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>II. THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. In relevant part for purposes of this advisory opinion, 
  the statute prohibits the purposeful transfer of remuneration to a person or 
  entity to induce the person or entity to arrange for or recommend the purchasing 
  or ordering of a good or service payable by a Federal health care program. By 
  its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible 
  &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, 
  &quot;remuneration&quot; includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash 
  or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose 
  of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services or to induce 
  further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989); 
  <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 
  474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony punishable 
  by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. Conviction 
  will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, including 
  Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative proceedings 
  to exclude persons from Federal and State health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>A. Analysis</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Marketing by physicians or other health care professionals -- sometimes referred 
  to as &quot;white coat&quot; marketing -- is closely scrutinized under the anti-kickback 
  statute. Such parties are in an exceptional position of public trust and thus 
  may exert undue influence when recommending health care-related items or services, 
  especially when marketing to their patients. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, 56 Fed. 
  Reg. 35974. Given the nature of the physician-patient relationship, when physicians 
  market items and services to their patients, patients may have difficulty distinguishing 
  between the physician's professional medical advice on the one hand and a commercial 
  sales pitch on the other. <br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding, we conclude that, on the facts presented, the Proposed Arrangement 
  does not fall within the ambit of the anti-kickback statute, and even if it 
  did, we would not subject Company A to OIG sanctions for violation of the anti-kickback 
  statute. Simply put, on the facts presented, neither the contracting retailers 
  nor Company A is paying the physicians and health care clinics to arrange for 
  or recommend the purchase or order of items or services reimbursable by a Federal 
  health care program. <br>
  <br>
  Under the Proposed Arrangement, the physicians and clinics will be paid to distribute 
  coupons that will entitle the holders to discounts on purchases of certain items 
  that are not reimbursable by any Federal health care program at select retail 
  stores.<a
href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> The coupons will not be tied directly or indirectly 
  to the purchase or order of any items or services covered by a Federal health 
  care program. The physicians and clinics will be required to distribute the 
  coupons to <em>all</em> of their patients, without regard to their insurance 
  coverage or the likelihood that they will require Federally-covered items or 
  services provided by the retailer, or indeed will patronize the retailer at 
  all. The contracting retailers will be businesses offering a wide variety of 
  medical and non-medical items and services; none will be businesses specializing 
  in Federally-reimbursable items or services (e.g., storefront medical equipment 
  shops). Given the totality of the circumstances, the conduct of the physicians 
  and health clinics under the Proposed Arrangement cannot reasonably be construed 
  as recommending or arranging for the purchase or order of Federally-reimbursable 
  items or services. <br>
  <br>
  Our conclusion that the Proposed Arrangement does not implicate the anti-kickback 
  statute derives from the particular facts presented. In the instant case, we 
  might have reached a different conclusion if, by way of example only, any of 
  the following factors had been present: 
<ul>
  <li>Coupons tied directly or indirectly to the order or purchase of an item 
    or service covered by a Federal health care program (<u>e.g</u>., coupon redemption 
    conditioned directly or indirectly on the purchase of a reimbursable item 
    or service, such as a covered prescription drug or device; or coupons with 
    values that vary based on the purchase of a Federally-reimbursable item or 
    service);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Distribution of coupons targeted at Federal health care program beneficiaries 
    (<u>e.g</u>., distributed primarily to Federal health care program beneficiaries); 
    or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Coupons with exceptionally large values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any one of these or other factors may have resulted in a different outcome 
  in this opinion. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III. SECTION 1128A(a)(5) OF THE ACT</strong> <br>
  <br>
  A further question arises as to whether the Proposed Arrangement violates section 
  1128A(a)(5) of the Act, which prohibits a person from offering or transferring 
  remuneration to a beneficiary that such person knows or should know is likely 
  to influence the beneficiary to order items or services from a particular provider, 
  practitioner, or supplier for which payment may be made by Medicare or a State 
  health care program. For purposes of section 1128A(a)(5), &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market 
  value. <u>See</u> section 1128A(a)(6) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  Under the Proposed Arrangement, the relationship between the coupon distribution 
  and any inducement to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to choose a particular 
  provider for a covered item or service will be attenuated, at best. As noted 
  above, the coupons are not tied (directly or indirectly) to the purchase of 
  any items or services covered by Medicare or Medicaid, nor is the distribution 
  targeted at patients who are likely to purchase or order items or services for 
  which Medicare or Medicaid will reimburse the retailer offering the discount 
  (e.g., the coupons are not distributed only to patients who leave their physician's 
  office with a prescription in hand). The coupons may not be applied to any Medicare- 
  or Medicaid-covered item or service. The Proposed Arrangement is unlikely to 
  give the clinics or physicians that distribute the coupons a significant competitive 
  advantage in the marketplace. For these reasons, in the particular circumstances 
  of the Proposed Arrangement, the OIG will not subject Company A to sanctions 
  under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Based on the information provided, we conclude that, based on the totality of 
  the facts of the Proposed Arrangement (as described and certified in the request 
  letter and supplemental submissions), the Proposed Arrangement does not implicate 
  the anti-kickback statute and that the OIG will not subject Company A to sanctions 
  for violations of the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) 
  or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement, nor will 
  the OIG impose civil monetary penalties on Company A, in connection with the 
  Proposed Arrangement for violations of the prohibition against inducements to 
  beneficiaries under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>V. LIMITATIONS</strong> <br>

    involving an entity or individual that is not a requester to this opinion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is applicable only to the statutory provisions specifically 
    noted above. No opinion is herein expressed or implied with respect to the 
    application of any other Federal, state, or local statute, rule, regulation, 
    ordinance, or other law that may be applicable to the Proposed Arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion will not bind or obligate any agency other than the 
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>This advisory opinion is limited in scope to the specific arrangement described 
    in this letter and has no applicability to other arrangements, even those 
    that appear similar in nature or scope.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No opinion is expressed herein regarding the liability of any party under 
    the False Claims Act or other legal authorities for any improper billing, 
    claims submission, cost reporting, or related conduct. </li>
</ul>
<p>This opinion is also subject to any additional limitations set forth at 42 
  C.F.R. Part 1008. <br>
  <br>
  The OIG will not proceed against the requester with respect to any action that 
  is part of the Proposed Arrangement taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory 
  opinion as long as all of the material facts have been fully, completely, and 
  accurately presented, the fees paid under the Proposed Arrangement are fair 
  market value, and the Proposed Arrangement in practice comports with the information 
  provided. The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions and issues 
  raised in this advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, rescind, 
  modify, or terminate this opinion. In the event that this advisory opinion is 
  modified or terminated, the OIG will not proceed against the requester with 
  respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon this advisory opinion, 
  where all of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented, 
  where the fees paid under the Proposed Arrangement were at fair market value, 
  and where such action was promptly discontinued upon notification of the modification 
  or termination of this advisory opinion. An advisory opinion may be rescinded 
  only if the relevant and material facts have not been fully, completely, and 
  accurately disclosed to the OIG. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>D. McCarty Thornton <br>
  Chief Counsel to the Inspector General </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>We are not authorized to opine on &quot;fair market value.&quot; 
  <u>See</u> section 1128D(b)(3) of the Act. Therefore, for purposes of this opinion, 
  we have assumed fair market value compensation based on Company A's certifications. 
  If the compensation under the Proposed Arrangement is not at fair market value, 
  this opinion will be without force and effect. </p>
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>Although the Department of Health and Human Services 
  has promulgated safe harbor regulations that define practices that are not subject 
  to the anti-kickback statute, 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952, no safe harbor protects 
  the Proposed Arrangement. The requirements of the personal services and management 
  contracts safe harbor, § 1001.952(d), will not be met here in every case. </p>
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions 
  related to the anti-kickback implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based 
  on violations of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis for purposes of this 
  advisory opinion is the same under both. </p>
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>Company A has certified that the physicians' and clinics' 
  compensation for distributing the coupons will be consistent with fair market 
  value and fixed in arms-length negotiations. <u>See</u> <u>supra</u> note 1. 
  &quot;Per click&quot;, &quot;per patient&quot;, &quot;per order&quot;, and similar 
  payment arrangements are highly disfavored under the anti-kickback statute. 
  Here, compensation under the Proposed Arrangement will not be based directly 
  or indirectly on the volume or value of business -- Federal or otherwise -- 
  that the coupons generate (as might be the case, for example, if the physicians 
  and clinics were paid based on the number of coupons redeemed by, or the value 
  of retail sales made to, their patients). While it is possible that some physicians 
  and clinics may realize an intangible &quot;good will&quot; benefit from distributing 
  retail coupons to patients, the value of any such benefit is likely to be small 
  in these particular circumstances and, given the economic structure of the Proposed 
  Arrangement, accounted for in the arms-length negotiations between Company A 
  and the physicians and clinics. </p>
