  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: <br>
  <br>
  We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion about a rural 
  telemedicine network arrangement implemented and operated pursuant to Federal 
  grants from the Office of Rural Health Policy (&quot;ORHP&quot;) and the Office 
  for the Advancement of Telehealth (&quot;OAT&quot;), divisions of the Health 
  Resources Services Administration (&quot;HRSA&quot;). Specifically, you have 
  inquired whether the use of Federal grant funds and the continued operation 
  of the telemedicine network after the expiration of the grant period would, 
  in the circumstances presented, constitute grounds for the imposition of sanctions 
  for violations of the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social 
  Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act. <br>
  <br>
  In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. <br>
  <br>
  Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Arrangement (as defined 
  in the next sentence) could potentially involve prohibited remuneration under 
  section 1128B(b) of the Act, if the requisite intent to induce referrals were 
  present; however, the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) will not 
  impose sanctions on Health System A (&quot;Health System A&quot;) for violations 
  of the anti-kickback statute arising under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act in connection with the Arrangement (limited as set forth in the next 
  sentence), as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental 
  submissions. For purposes of this advisory opinion, the &quot;Arrangement&quot; 
  means, collectively, Health System A's (i) use of Federal grant funds under 
  the terms of the ORHP/OAT grants; (ii) continued provision of telemedicine consultations 
  within the Telemedicine Network (&quot;Telemedicine Network&quot;) after the 
  end of the grant period; (iii) continued payment of transmission line charges 
  related to the Telemedicine Network (whether by Health System A or third party 
  sources arranged for by Health System A) after the end of the grant period; 
  (iv) continued payments after the end of the grant period to an unrelated third-party 
  vendor to maintain the existing telemedicine equipment owned by Health System 
  A until January 2003; (v) lease of telemedicine equipment to members of the 
  Telemedicine Network pursuant to leases that satisfy the equipment rental safe 
  harbor at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d) after the end of the grant period; and (vi) 
  participation in the administration of the Telemedicine Network for telemedicine 
  purposes after the end of the grant period.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Health System A 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
</p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BACKGROUND</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The Rural Telemedicine Grant Program</strong> <br>
  <br>
  We begin with a discussion of the relevant Federal telemedicine grant programs. 
  For purposes of this advisory opinion, the two grant programs described below 
  will be collectively referred to as the &quot;Telemedicine Grant Program&quot; 
  or &quot;TGP&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  Congress established the Rural Telemedicine Grant Program through the Department 
  of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act of FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103-112) 
  to demonstrate and collect information on the feasibility, cost, appropriateness, 
  and acceptability (to practitioners and patients) of telemedicine consultations 
  for improving access to health care services for rural residents and for reducing 
  the isolation of rural practitioners. The program, administered by ORHP (later 
  OAT<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), was designed to demonstrate how telemedicine 
  could be used as an effective tool in the development of integrated systems 
  of health care for rural residents. <u>See</u> 1994 TGP Program Guide at 1. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For purposes of the TGP, ORHP defined telemedicine as the use of telecommunications 
  for medical diagnosis and patient care, including patient counseling and clinical 
  training of residents and health professions students when such training is 
  a by-product of direct patient care. <u>See</u> <u>Id.</u> at 1. Under the 1994 
  grant program, telemedicine consultations could be performed with or without 
  the patient present, as appropriate. <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 2. <br>
  <br>
  The 1994 grant program required recipients to participate in a telemedicine 
  network composed of (i) a &quot;hub&quot; multi-speciality entity capable of 
  providing 24-hour a day specialty consultations for all specialty services offered 
  through the network<a
href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and (ii) at least one small rural hospital (fewer 
  than 100 beds) and one rural primary care practitioner office or clinic (the 
  &quot;spokes&quot;). Other rural sites could also participate, including long-term 
  care facilities, mental health clinics, school-based clinics, emergency services 
  providers, home health providers, and health professions schools. <u>See</u> 
  <u>id.</u> at 1-2. <br>
  <br>
  To be eligible for grant purposes, a telemedicine network had to consist of 
  a partnership (whether a consortium of independent entities or other more formal 
  affiliation)<a
href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> evidenced by: 
<ul>
  <li>a resource contribution from each member (in cash or in kind);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a specified role for each member;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>active participation of each member in the planning and implementation of 
    the telemedicine project;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a clearly articulated relationship evidenced by a signed and dated memorandum 
    of agreement delineating the roles and resource contributions of each member; 
    and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a long-term commitment by each member to continue working together beyond 
    the funding period of the grant program.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>See</u> <u>id.</u> Grant recipients had to provide teleconsultation services 
  in a minimum of eight core areas: teleradiology, cardiology, dermatology, mental 
  health and/or substance abuse, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, subspecialities 
  of pediatrics, and resuscitation of trauma patients. <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 
  3. TGP grants were typically awarded to the &quot;hub&quot; entities or to the 
  network itself (if the network were a legal entity capable of receiving grant 
  funds). <br>
  <br>
  In 1996, Congress passed the Health Centers Consolidation Act of 1996 (&quot;HCCA&quot;), 
  which established, <em>inter alia</em>, the Rural Health Outreach, Network Development, 
  and Telemedicine Grant Program under section 330A of the Public Health Service 
  Act (42 U.S.C. § 254c) and specifically authorized the Director of ORHP to award 
  grants &quot;to expand access to, coordinate, restrain the cost of, and improve 
  the quality of essential health care services, including preventive and emergency 
  services, through the development of integrated health care delivery systems 
  or networks in rural areas and regions.&quot; 42 U.S.C. § 254c(b). Under HCCA, 
  telemedicine grants could be used within specified limits to: 
<ul>
  <li>demonstrate the use of telemedicine in facilitating the development of rural 
    health care networks and improving the access to health care services for 
    rural citizens;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>provide a baseline of information for a systematic evaluation of telemedicine 
    systems serving rural areas;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>purchase or lease and install telemedicine equipment; and </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>operate and evaluate the telemedicine system. </li>
</ul>
<p>42 U.S.C. § 254c(e)(3)(A). <br>
  <br>
  In 1997, the TGP grant application procedure and requirements were largely the 
  same as in 1994, except that ORHP additionally required all applicants to document 
  current referral patterns, including both referral patterns among network members 
  and referral patterns that extended beyond network members. <u>See</u> 1997 
  TGP Program Guide. In addition, ORHP allowed grant funds to be used to make 
  clinician incentive payments to consulting specialists of up to $60 per consultation, 
  so long as there were no third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, 
  that <em>could</em> be billed for such consultations (regardless of whether 
  they were in fact billed). <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 3. The 1997 grant required 
  applicants to provide at least seven clinical telemedicine services, specifically 
  including the stabilization of patients in emergency situations and at least 
  two consultative services provided by physician specialists. The grant recipients 
  could select the other six services based on community need (e.g., services 
  not available locally or services rural residents might forgo if they had to 
  travel far or often to receive them). <u>See id.</u> at 18. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The Arrangement</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The Arrangement is a telemedicine network organized by Health System A and ten 
  outlying rural facilities and funded in part through two TGP grants. <br>
  <br>
  Health System A is a [# redacted]-bed regional health care center<strong> </strong>located 
  in City W, State X, serving over [# redacted] persons spread over [# redacted] 
  square miles in [geographical designation redacted] State X and [geographical 
  designation redacted] State Y. Health System A is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable 
  institution consisting of the following subsidiaries: Health System A Hospital 
  (a [# redacted]-bed general acute care hospital and U.S. Designated Regional 
  Referral Center), Hospital B (an [# redacted]-bed psychiatric and chemical dependency 
  facility), [names of subsidiaries redacted], and Health System A Hospital Foundation, 
  a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable institution whose mission is to support the 
  health care services, research, and educational mission of Health System A. 
  Health System A belongs to Network C, a national health care network. Health 
  System A also participates in a physician-hospital organization with its medical 
  staff and is developing a health maintenance organization to provide services 
  in its service area. <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, Health System A formed the Telemedicine Network<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  with the stated goal of using telemedicine to provide better access to health 
  care services for rural citizens at remote locations without the inconvenience 
  or risks normally associated with travel or delays in treatment. Telemedicine 
  Network's service area includes approximately [# redacted] residents in an area 
  of approximately [# redacted] square miles. Telemedicine Network currently consists 
  of Health System A (the &quot;hub&quot;) and [# redacted] outlying rural health 
  care facilities (the &quot;spokes&quot;), including [# redacted] hospitals and 
  [# redacted] rural health clinics.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
  Each outlying &quot;spoke&quot; facility has a written telemedicine network 
  provider agreement with Health System A. Under these agreements, Health System 
  A agrees to provide the &quot;spoke&quot; facilities with technical communications 
  capability, telemedicine equipment (which remains the property of Health System 
  A), and technical assistance and training. In addition, Health System A agrees 
  to coordinate the Telemedicine Network telemedicine program and assume responsibility 
  for paying transmission line charges during the period it receives grant funds 
  under the TGP. In turn, the &quot;spokes&quot; agree to provide space and a 
  consultation room for the telemedicine equipment (including any remodeling necessary 
  to accommodate the equipment), site facilitators, local data collection and 
  documentation assistance, additional equipment such as video cassette recorders 
  and video tapes, and security for the telemedicine equipment. The &quot;spokes&quot; 
  also agree to promote the use of the Telemedicine Network for medical consultations 
  to their medical staffs and to encourage and train their physicians in the implementation 
  of the telemedicine program. <br>
  <br>
  In 1994 and again in 1997, Health System A Hospital Foundation applied for, 
  and was awarded, TGP grants to support the Telemedicine Network in the amounts 
  of $[x] and $[y], respectively.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> Each grant 
  had a three-year term. The grant funds were designated in part for the purchase 
  of telemedicine equipment and its placement in the outlying &quot;spoke&quot; 
  facilities and for payment of necessary line costs so that patients, physicians, 
  and other health care professionals could receive professional consultations 
  from physicians at Health System A's tertiary care facilities: Health System 
  A Hospital and Hospital B.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> The 1997 grant 
  funds were further designated to pay fees to the physicians providing the consultations. 
</p>
<p>Health System A has certified that its use of the TGP grant funds has been, 
  and will continue to be, consistent with the statutory and regulatory TGP grant 
  guidelines and conditions, which include, without limitation, the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Funds may be used to support the operating costs of the telemedicine system, 
    including compensation for specialists and referring practitioners.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No more than 40% of the total grant award may be used to purchase or lease 
    telemedicine equipment. No grant funds may be used for the costs of purchasing 
    and installing transmission equipment, such as laying cable or telephone lines, 
    microwave towers, digital switching equipment, amplifiers, and the like. Grant 
    funds may be used to pay transmission costs, such as the cost of satellite 
    time or use of phone lines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Grant funds may not be used for construction, except minor renovations to 
    accommodate the installation of the telemedicine equipment. Grant dollars 
    may not be used to acquire or build real property.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No more than 20% of the grant funds may be used to cover indirect costs 
    associated with the network.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>All grant funds must be used for services provided to or in rural communities 
    and a majority of grant dollars must actually be spent in rural communities 
    for direct services to those communities, including salaries, maintenance 
    of equipment, and transmission costs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Grant funds may be used for clinician incentive payments of up to $60 per 
    physician, per consultation, only if no third-party payer <em>could</em> be 
    billed for such consultation [added by OAT in 1997].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Grant dollars may be used to support the development of a business plan 
    as part of the network's required continuation proposal. As a condition on 
    Health System A's receiving grant funding throughout the term of the grant, 
    ORHP must approve the business plan (submitted in year two of the grant) to 
    continue the network after the grant term expires [added by OAT in 1997].</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the Telemedicine Network offers interactive and asynchronous telemedicine 
  consultations in thirty-five medical specialties. Health System A has agreements 
  with approximately [over one hundred] physicians to provide telemedicine consultations 
  through the network. Of these physicians, approximately 10% are employed by 
  Health System A; the remainder are on the Health System A hospital medical staff. 
  The greatest number of consultations are provided in the area of mental health, 
  followed by teleradiology and speech pathology.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
  The network is also used to provide educational and in-service training programs. 
  The Telemedicine Network is overseen by a project manager and a Telemedicine 
  Advisory Committee consisting of representatives of Health System A and the 
  &quot;spoke&quot; facilities. <br>
  <br>
  In its 1997 grant application, Health System A estimated that it would receive 
  one inpatient admission for every twenty-five telemedicine consultation services 
  it provides to the network. Health System A has represented that apart from 
  the telemedicine equipment funded by the TGP grants and its own payment of line 
  and some maintenance costs, Health System A has not made (and will not make) 
  any payments to, and has not financially supported (and will not financially 
  support), directly or indirectly, telemedicine related services of the other 
  members of the Telemedicine Network or any of their affiliated physicians or 
  health care professionals. </p>
<p>Health System A is currently preparing its business plan for the continuation 
  and expansion of the Telemedicine Network after the grant period expires on 
  August 31, 2000. In general, the network will operate for the same purpose and 
  in the same manner as under the TGP grants. Health System A plans to continue 
  paying for all or part of the transmission line charges related to Telemedicine 
  Network services, with the assistance of third party sources as available.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
  In addition, until no later than January 2003, Health System A will continue 
  to pay for maintenance of the telemedicine equipment owned by Health System 
  A and placed at the &quot;spoke&quot; facilities during the grant period.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
  Except as provided in the previous sentence, the rural &quot;spoke&quot; facilities 
  will provide their own staffing, space, and maintenance for telemedicine equipment. 
  Existing and new &quot;spoke&quot; facilities will be responsible for the costs 
  of purchasing new or replacement equipment for their respective sites. In some 
  cases, Health System A may purchase telemedicine equipment centrally and lease 
  it to the &quot;spoke&quot; facilities at fair market rental rates pursuant 
  to rental agreements that meet the requirements of the equipment rental safe 
  harbor at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(c). Health System A has not paid, and does not 
  intend to pay, any cash or cash equivalent to any &quot;spoke&quot; facility 
  with respect to telemedicine. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> 
  <strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal Reimbursement</strong> 
  <strong>for Telemedicine Services</strong> <br>
  <br>
  A key component of the operation and continuation of the Telemedicine Network 
  is the evolving system of reimbursement for telemedicine services. <br>
  <br>
  Historically, Medicare has reimbursed only those telemedicine applications where, 
  under conventional health care delivery methods, the medical services do not 
  require face-to-face, &quot;hands on&quot; contact between patient and physician. 
  For example, Medicare has covered teleradiology, the most widely used and reimbursed 
  form of telemedicine, as well as physician interpretation of electrocardiogram 
  and electroencephalogram readings that are transmitted electronically. By contrast, 
  Medicare has not, until recently, covered other physician services delivered 
  through telecommunications systems because under the conventional delivery of 
  medicine, those services are furnished in person. <u>See</u> <u>generally</u> 
  Medicare Program Payment for Teleconsultations in Rural Health Professional 
  Shortage Areas (Proposed Rule), 63 Fed. Reg. 33,882 (June 22, 1998); 63 Fed. 
  Reg. 58,879 (Nov. 2, 1998) (Final Rule). <br>
  <br>
  Under section 4206 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (&quot;BBA&quot;) (Pub. 
  L. 105-33), Congress required Medicare Part B, as of January 1, 1999, to begin 
  paying for certain professional consultations via telecommunications systems 
  for beneficiaries residing in rural areas designated as health professional 
  shortage areas (&quot;HPSAs&quot;). Congress further required, among other things, 
  that the payment be shared between the referring practitioner and the consulting 
  practitioner; that the amount of the payment not exceed the current fee schedule 
  amount that would be paid to the consulting practitioner; that the payment <em>not</em> 
  include any reimbursement for telephone line charges or facility fees; and that 
  beneficiaries not be billed for any transmission line charges or facility fees 
  (although beneficiaries remain obligated for applicable Medicare copayments 
  and deductibles). <br>
  <br>
  The Health Care Financing Administration (&quot;HCFA&quot;) has promulgated 
  regulations implementing section 4206. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 58,879, 58,909 
  (1998) (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. § 410.78). HCFA interprets section 4206 
  as applying only to interactive patient encounters where the patient is present 
  and the telecommunications technology allows the consulting practitioner to 
  control the interactive medical examination of the patient. <u>Id.</u> at 58,909-10. 
  &quot;Store-and-forward&quot; technologies, like those used in teleradiology, 
  typically do not meet this requirement (although HCFA allows for payment when 
  such technologies are used for interactive patient encounters that meet the 
  teleconsultation requirements). Under the regulations, the practitioner who 
  provides the consultation is paid the applicable physician fee schedule amount 
  and is required to pay 25% of that amount to the referring (e.g., the &quot;spoke&quot;) 
  practitioner. The regulations do not provide for any payment of facility fees 
  or technical components to hospitals or other facilities. <br>
  <br>
  Health System A currently receives no reimbursement from any Federal health 
  care program for teleconsultations provided through the network. Given the limitations 
  of section 4206 of BBA and the HCFA regulations (in particular, the requirements 
  that patients reside in HPSAs and that no hospital or facility technical fees 
  are paid), Health System A anticipates receiving limited Medicare reimbursement 
  related to the Telemedicine Network in the future. Health System A may receive 
  some technical fees related to teleradiology services reimbursed under the conventional 
  (i.e., &quot;hands-on&quot; services) rules. <br>
  <br>
  Network practitioners, however, may be paid for telemedicine services in several 
  ways: 
<ul>
  <li>consulting practitioners may receive Medicare payments for interactive consultations 
    under section 4206 of the BBA and the corresponding regulations; the consulting 
    practitioners are required to remit 25% of the fee to the referring practitioners;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>consulting radiologists whose services are not interactive will continue 
    to bill and be reimbursed as they always have for teleradiology services (<u>see</u> 
    <u>generally</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 2020A); however, referring practitioners 
    receive no Medicare reimbursement related to an interpretation of an x-ray 
    via telecommunications (i.e., the 25% split does not apply); </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>as of July 1, 2000, consulting and referring practitioners may be eligible 
    for Medicaid payments pursuant to recently enacted legislation in State X; 
    and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>to the extent no Federal or other third-party payments are available, consulting 
    practitioners may be paid the $60 clinician incentive fee from the 1997 grant 
    funds until the expiration of the grant term in 2000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAW AND ANALYSIS</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; transaction. For purposes 
  of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3<sup>d</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs or to impose 
  civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities 
  under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  We have stated often our view that a gift to an existing or potential referral 
  source that has independent value to such source implicates the anti-kickback 
  statute and may be unlawful if the donor of the gift has the requisite intent 
  to induce Federal health care program referrals. For example, in the preamble 
  to the 1991 safe harbor regulations, we stated that giving a physician who is 
  a referral source a free computer that has independent value to the physician 
  may violate the statute. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. 35,978 (July 29, 1991); <u>see 
  also</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, OIG Advisory Opinion 98-16 (Nov. 3, 1998) (concluding 
  that the provision of free transplant pharmacy services to a transplant center 
  may violate the anti-kickback statute); OIG Special Fraud Alert, 59 Fed. Reg. 
  65373 (Dec. 19, 1994) (explaining that the anti-kickback statute is implicated 
  if a clinical laboratory provides a phlebotomist to a physician to perform tasks 
  normally the responsibility of the physician's office staff). <br>
  <br>
  With these concerns in mind, in OIG Advisory Opinion 98-18 (Nov. 25, 1998), 
  we concluded that we would not impose sanctions on an arrangement for the provision 
  of telemedicine equipment between an ophthalmologist and an optometrist where 
  the optometrist would pay fair market value (as certified by the requesting 
  party), and the lease would fit in the equipment rental safe harbor. As noted 
  in 98-18, our concern about possible anti-kickback implications extended beyond 
  the value of the equipment itself to the value of the resulting teleconsultations 
  to both the referring and consulting practitioners. In 98-18, these concerns 
  were addressed through certifications that (i) the arrangement would have no 
  independent value to the optometrist, because she would neither use the arrangement 
  for marketing purposes, nor collect a fee for the teleconsultation services, 
  and (ii) the parties had no oral or written collateral agreements or understandings 
  between them, including agreements or understandings regarding the referral 
  of patients from either party to the other. <br>
  <br>
  Despite factual differences, the Arrangement here presents similar kickback 
  concerns. By developing, operating, administering, and funding the Telemedicine 
  Network's telemedicine network (in whole or in part), Health System A confers 
  a benefit on two potential referral sources: (i) the rural &quot;spokes&quot; 
  (and, by extension, the referring health care professionals), which obtain free 
  equipment and subsidized line charges, and (ii) the &quot;hub&quot; consulting 
  practitioners, who receive additional opportunities to earn fees. If one purpose 
  of this remuneration is to induce referrals to a Health System A facility or 
  practitioner, the anti-kickback statute would be implicated. <br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding, the Telemedicine Network presently operates under the auspices 
  of the TGP, pursuant to a clearly expressed congressional directive to promote 
  telemedicine networks in rural areas, subject to certain statutory limitations 
  and oversight by ORHP/OAT. So long as Health System A is a grant recipient in 
  good standing, and Health System A and the Telemedicine Network satisfy all 
  statutory, regulatory, and administrative grant requirements (including, but 
  not limited to, the expenditure of grant funds and the 24-hour provision of 
  specialty consultations), we do not believe, on the facts presented, that the 
  Arrangement (limited to those aspects described in Part III below) falls into 
  the category of payment practices Congress intended to outlaw under the anti-kickback 
  statute.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
  The continued operation of the Telemedicine Network beyond the grant-funded 
  period is also consistent with congressional intent and the TGP program. However, 
  the absence of applicable grant restrictions and OAT oversight in the post-grant 
  period increases the risk that improper payments for referrals could be masked 
  as payments for telemedicine network purposes. This is especially true where, 
  as here, some parties to the telemedicine network are engaged in, or contemplating, 
  other joint business relationships. <br>
  <br>
  Under the Arrangement in the post-grant period, payments from Health System 
  A to the &quot;spoke&quot; facilities will be limited to supplemental funding 
  of (i) all or part of the transmission line charges related to the teleconsultation 
  services provided through the Telemedicine Network and (ii) until January 2003, 
  continued maintenance of existing telemedicine equipment owned by Health System 
  A. For everything else, the &quot;spokes&quot; pay their own way, with financial 
  responsibility for all of their own staffing, operational, and maintenance costs, 
  as well as the costs of new or replacement equipment. The &quot;spokes&quot; 
  will remain free (though not necessarily encouraged) to use teleconsultants 
  who are not part of the Telemedicine Network. The Advisory Board will continue 
  to operate in its same capacity. <br>
  <br>
  By subsidizing the Telemedicine Network's transmission line charges and equipment 
  maintenance beyond the grant-funded period, Health System A may in some cases 
  subsidize the private practice incomes of its &quot;hub&quot; consulting practitioners 
  and the referring &quot;spoke&quot; practitioners, many of whom are potential 
  referral sources for Health System A's facilities and providers. Typically these 
  consulting and referring practitioners are not performing a hospital service 
  when they participate in a telemedicine consultation through the Telemedicine 
  Network; rather, they are engaged in their own private medical practices. Absent 
  changes to HCFA's reimbursement rules (under which hospitals are not reimbursed 
  for telemedicine services), if such practitioners are permitted to participate 
  in the network without bearing a &quot;fair share&quot; of its costs, they stand 
  to reap future financial rewards while Health System A bears the corresponding 
  financial burdens. However, we would expect that, at such time as telemedicine 
  becomes financially viable, the practitioners who benefit economically from 
  the Telemedicine Network will also pay their share of its costs. <br>
  <br>
  Finally and importantly, the Arrangement presents an opportunity for significant 
  community benefit through the study and development of telemedicine as a mechanism 
  to (i) improve access to essential health care services (including preventive 
  and emergency services) for rural patients who may otherwise forgo care; (ii) 
  constrain health care costs in rural areas; and (iii) reduce the isolation of 
  rural health care professionals. <br>
  <br>
  Given all of the facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, (i) 
  the clear congressional policy favoring the study and development of rural telemedicine 
  networks, (ii) the oversight of the Telemedicine Network by ORHP/OAT during 
  the grant period, (iii) Health System A's representation that it has complied 
  fully (and will continue to comply fully) with the terms of its TGP grants, 
  (iv) the comprehensive range of telemedicine services provided through the network, 
  (v) the limited remuneration during the post-grant period, and (vi) the significant 
  potential community benefit to rural citizens through increased access to health 
  care, we conclude that we would not impose sanctions on Health System A for 
  violations of the anti-kickback statute arising from the Arrangement. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Arrangement (as defined 
  in the next sentence) could potentially involve prohibited remuneration under 
  section 1128B(b) of the Act, if the requisite intent to induce referrals were 
  present; however, the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) will not 
  impose sanctions on Health System A for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
  arising under sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with 
  the Arrangement (limited as set forth in the next sentence), as described and 
  certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions. For purposes of 
  this paragraph, the &quot;Arrangement&quot; means, collectively, Health System 
  A's (i) use of Federal grant funds under the terms of the ORHP/OAT grants; (ii) 
  continued provision of telemedicine consultations within the Telemedicine Network 
  after the end of the grant period; (iii) continued payment of transmission line 
  charges related to the Telemedicine Network (whether by Health System A or third 
  party sources arranged for by Health System A) after the end of the grant period; 
  (iv) continued payments after the end of the grant period to an unrelated third-party 
  vendor to maintain the existing telemedicine equipment owned by Health System 
  A until January 2003; (v) lease of telemedicine equipment to members of the 
  Telemedicine Network pursuant to leases that satisfy the equipment rental safe 
  harbor at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d) after the end of the grant period; and (vi) 
  participation in the administration of the Telemedicine Network for telemedicine 
  purposes after the end of the grant period. <br>

<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>In the initial years, teleradiology played a small role

  1994 grant. Of the original [# redacted] physicians who agreed to provide consultations, 
  only [# redacted] were radiologists, and the Telemedicine Network didn't begin 
  teleradiology services until April 1998. Because of certain limitations of available 
  technology (e.g., resolution of transmissions), grant-funded teleradiology equipment 
  has been installed in only one spoke facility. However, Telemedicine Network 
  may expand its teleradiology capabilities using TGP grant funds to purchase

<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>Health System A expects that the Telemedicine Network's

<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions

<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>This opinion is limited to the facts presented. Circumstances
