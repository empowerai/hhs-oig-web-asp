<p>Re: [name redacted] 
<p>Advisory Opinion No. 99-3 <br>
  <br>
<p>Dear [name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request on behalf of Company A, for an advisory 
  opinion concerning whether a proposed pricing arrangement for a package of therapeutic 
  mattresses for skilled nursing facility patients to be marketed by Company A, 
  and certain commissioned agents (the "Proposed Arrangement") would result in 
  prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of 
  the Social Security Act (the "Act") or would constitute grounds for the imposition 
  of sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the 
  exclusion authority related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or 
  the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Arrangement, as described in your advisory opinion request 
  and supplemental submissions, might constitute prohibited remuneration under 
  the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal 
  health care program business were present, but that the Office of Inspector 
  General ("OIG") will not subject it to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the addressee and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part III below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>Company A ("Company A"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company B, is a distributor 
  of therapeutic mattresses used for the treatment and prevention of pressure 
  ulcers. The Proposed Arrangement involves two types of mattresses (also known 
  as support surfaces): (i) a powered support surface, the Company A therapeutic 
  mattress system; and (ii) a non-powered support surface, the Company A pressure 
  relieving mattress. Typically, a powered mattress is used as part of a treatment 
  protocol for aggressive wound healing, while a non-powered mattress may be used 
  to complete the course of treatment by facilitating continued healing and preventing 
  the recurrence of pressure ulcers. Company A has certified that the Company 
  A powered mattress has a fair market rental value of $<em>x</em> per month.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Company A has certified that $<em>y</em> is the fair market value of a single 
  non-powered mattress purchased by an institution. 
<p>Company A proposes offering Medicare-certified skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs") 
  special pricing for these therapeutic mattresses for patients undergoing treatment 
  for pressure ulcers. Under the Proposed Arrangement, Company A will rent a SNF 
  a powered mattress for thirty days for a fixed amount ($<em>x</em>) set in advance 
  by Company A and applicable to all similarly-situated SNF customers. The rental 
  price includes the provision of a non-powered mattress at no additional charge, 
  to be used when the patient's condition improves such that he or she no longer 
  requires the powered mattress. If the patient continues to require a powered 
  mattress after the initial thirty days, Company A will provide the powered mattress 
  for additional thirty-day periods at half of the original thirty day rental 
  amount ($(1/2)(<em>x</em>)/month). The total amount charged for the powered/non-powered 
  mattress combination ($<em>x</em>) will be substantially lower than the price 
  Company A currently charges for these mattresses when rented and sold separately 
  ($<em>x</em>+ $<em>y</em> = $(<em>x+y</em>)). The price charged for successive 
  months' rental of the powered mattress will also be lower than the price charged 
  for the same number of months rented separately. For example, a package of two 
  months' rental of the powered mattress will cost $(<em>x</em>+1/2<em>x</em>), 
  whereas two months rented separately costs $2<em>x</em> [($<em>x</em> + $<em>x</em>)]. 
<p>While Company A will market the Proposed Arrangement directly to its major 
  customers, it will also contract with durable medical equipment ("DME") suppliers 
  to serve as sales agents to market the Proposed Arrangement to some SNFs. As 
  compensation, the DME sales agents will receive 20% of collections from any 
  Proposed Arrangements for which they are responsible.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>The 
  compensation covers the cost of selling activities, delivery, follow-up, and 
  assistance in the collections process when necessary. Company A has certified 
  that the compensation represents fair market value in an arms-length transaction.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  Payment for the mattresses will be made by the SNF customers directly to Company 
  A. The contracted sales agents may market to SNFs products of other manufacturers 
  and suppliers that are reimbursable under either Part A or Part B of the Medicare 
  program. 
<p>Company A will require each DME supplier to provide Company A with an ownership 
  statement and to agree not to market Company A's therapeutic mattresses to SNFs 
  with which the DME supplier has a financial relationship. Company A has certified 
  that it will monitor the DME supplier's compliance with these conditions. In 
  addition, Company A will require the DME sales agents to disclose the special 
  mattress pricing to their SNF customers in writing and to inform the customers 
  of their obligation to report discounted prices accurately as required by any 
  Federal or state agency, in a manner consistent with the requirements of 42 
  C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h)(2)(ii). 
<p>All ordering and billing for the Proposed Arrangement will be done by Company 
  A, regardless of whether the order is generated by Company A or by a contracting 
  DME supplier. Company A's invoices for mattress packages purchased pursuant 
  to the Proposed Arrangement will fully, accurately, and clearly reflect the 
  discounted price of the package. For powered/non-powered mattress packages, 
  Company A will apportion the discount between the two products in proportion 
  to their fair market values. For one package, it will calculate the rental rate 
  net of discount for the powered mattress by multiplying the ratio of the undiscounted 
  rental rate for the powered mattress ($<em>x</em>) to the undiscounted bundled 
  or combined price ($<em>x+y</em>) by the discounted combined price ($<em>x</em>). 
  It will thus report a net rental rate of $<em>z</em> [where <em>z</em>= (<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em>/(<em>x+y</em>))] 
  for the powered mattress on the invoice. Using the same methodology, it will 
  report a net sales price for the non-powered mattress of $<em>w</em> [where 
  <em>w</em>=(<em>x</em>)(<em>y</em>/(<em>x+y</em>))]. For additional consecutive 
  months' rental of the powered mattress, Company A will report the total price 
  on the invoice ($(1/2<em>x</em>)/month). The invoice will clearly state that 
  the buyer has an obligation to report the discounted price on any cost reports 
  or other reports required by any Federal or state agency, in a manner consistent 
  with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h)(2)(ii). 
<p>Company A states that the market for the Proposed Arrangement will primarily 
  be SNFs that are being reimbursed for Medicare Part A services using the new 
  prospective payment system. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Public Law 105-33, 
  required the implementation of a prospective payment system ("PPS") covering 
  all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital) related to SNF services furnished 
  to beneficiaries under Part A of the Medicare program. The PPS for SNFs is being 
  implemented for the cost reporting period beginning after July 1, 1998. The 
  basic methodology is a prospectively fixed per diem payment adjusted to reflect 
  the resident's health status and needs and regional wage rate (the "Federal 
  case mix adjusted rate"). The per diem payment is based on classifications of 
  patients according to the amount and type of resources they use (resource utilization 
  groups, or "RUGs"). There is a transition phase during the first three cost 
  reporting years, during which SNFs will receive a blend of the Federal case 
  mix adjusted rate and a facility specific rate based on the facility's allowable 
  costs for SNF services for the fiscal 1995 cost reporting period. 
<p>One purpose of the Proposed Arrangement is to encourage SNFs to use the non-powered 
  mattress as a routine step-down treatment and to demonstrate that such use can 
  help prevent recurrences of ulcers, thereby saving costs and minimizing the 
  SNFs' risk under the new PPS system. 
<p>Company A has certified that the Company A powered mattress and the non-powered 
  Company A pressure relieving mattress included in the Proposed Arrangement are 
  the only items marketed or provided by Company A that are covered by Medicare 
  Part A. Moreover, Company A has certified that neither mattress is reimbursable 
  under Part B of the Medicare program for patients in nursing facilities. In 
  addition, Company A does not market or provide other items or services to potential 
  SNF customers that are reimbursable under Part B of the Medicare program. Company 
  A has also certified that, to its knowledge, only three State health care programs 
  (New York, Ohio, and California) may, in infrequent circumstances, provide separate 
  reimbursement for support surfaces used in long-term care facilities. 
<p>Company A has further certified that (i) Company A will have no financial arrangements 
  with any SNF that participates in the Proposed Arrangement apart from the Proposed 
  Arrangement; and (ii) Company A will have no commission-splitting or other financial 
  arrangements with any of the DME suppliers that will market the Proposed Arrangement, 
  except as disclosed in the request for an advisory opinion. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p><strong>The Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute contains a statutory exception for "a discount or 
  other reduction in price obtained by a provider of services or other entity 
  under a Federal health care program if the reduction in price is properly disclosed 
  and appropriately reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider 
  or entity under a Federal health care program." 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b)(3)(A). 
  The Department of Health and Human Services has published regulations implementing 
  this discount "safe harbor" exception. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h). 
  <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>The Bundled Pricing</strong> 
<p>The statutory discount exception, as implemented by the regulatory safe harbor, 
  does not protect "the practice of a seller giving away, or reducing the price 
  of, one good in connection with the purchase of a different good." <u>See</u> 
  56 Fed. Reg. 35952, 35978 (July 29, 1991). One of our major concerns with such 
  arrangements is the difficulty in ensuring that the monetary value of the discount 
  is appropriately apportioned and fully reported to the Federal health care programs. 
  <u>Id.</u> In other words, such "discounts" may shift costs among reimbursement 
  systems or distort the true costs of the items, making it difficult for the 
  Federal health care programs to determine appropriate reimbursement levels. 
  Accordingly, the final discount safe harbor specifically excludes from the definition 
  of discounts "furnishing one good or service without charge or at a reduced 
  charge in exchange for any agreement to buy a different good or service." <u>See</u> 
  42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h)(3)(ii). 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement involves a bundled therapeutic mattress package consisting 
  of an initial thirty day powered mattress rental, which includes a non-powered 
  mattress, and, if needed, additional thirty day rental periods at half price. 
  Where items are bundled, we will examine the circumstances to determine the 
  desirability of prosecuting such arrangements. The factors that we will look 
  at may include: (1) the amount of the benefit that is reported and passed along 
  to the programs, (2) whether the items are separately reimbursable, and (3) 
  the intent behind the arrangement. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. at 35978. 
<p>The Proposed Arrangement, as described and certified by Company A, poses a 
  minimal risk of kickback violations, and accordingly we would not subject it 
  to sanctions under the anti-kickback statute. The methodology used by Company 
  A to apportion the discount between the powered and non-powered mattresses is 
  reasonable and, assuming proper reporting by the SNF purchasers,<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  will assure that the price reported to any Federal health care program for each 
  product will fairly reflect the value of the discount. Moreover, the mattresses 
  that are the subject of the Proposed Arrangement will be used primarily in SNFs 
  that will be reimbursed a fixed prospectively determined amount for Part A beneficiaries. 
  Because the SNFs receive fixed per diem payments based on the patient's RUG 
  classification, regardless of the costs of the services provided to the patient, 
  the SNFs have an incentive to be prudent purchasers, i.e. to seek the lowest 
  price for mattresses and not to pay for any mattresses unless absolutely necessary. 
  In sum, so long as the discounted price for the package of mattresses is reflected 
  properly on the SNFs' cost reports, there is minimal risk of program fraud or 
  abuse from the Proposed Arrangement. 
<p>In addition, the Proposed Arrangement poses a minimal risk that discounts on 
  Part A items and services will be "swapped" for referrals of Part B business. 
  Many items that are included in the Part A SNF PPS payment may be separately 
  reimbursable on a charge or fee schedule basis under Part B when provided to 
  Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for skilled nursing care under Part 
  A, but who reside in a nursing facility with a SNF unit. In such situations, 
  there is a significant risk that suppliers might offer the SNF an excessively 
  low price for items or services provided to SNF Part A patients reimbursed under 
  the PPS methodology in return for the opportunity to service and bill nursing 
  facility patients with Part B coverage.<strong> </strong>Such arrangements are 
  highly suspect under the anti-kickback statute. In this case, however, Company 
  A has certified that neither the powered nor the non-powered mattress is separately 
  reimbursable by Medicare under Part B of the Medicare program for patients in 
  Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing facilities. Moreover, Company A does 
  not market or provide any items or services that are reimbursable under Part 
  B to potential SNF customers. Thus, Company A has no incentive to offer SNFs 
  a discounted price for mattresses to induce orders for Part B covered items 
  or services. 
<p>Finally, some SNFs may also utilize the powered or non-powered mattresses for 
  their residents receiving care pursuant to a State health care program. While 
  reimbursement methodologies vary widely among states, Company A has certified 
  that, to its knowledge, only three State health care programs (New York, Ohio, 
  and California) may, in infrequent circumstances, provide separate reimbursement 
  for support surfaces used in long-term care facilities. Except in these three 
  states, the cost of the mattresses would typically be included in the facility's 
  daily room and board rate. In a small number of states, the rate may be adjusted 
  based on a RUGS-type assessment. In any case, Company A's method of allocating 
  the discount between the two mattresses on the invoice will permit apportionment 
  among payors, including State health care programs, according to the appropriate 
  cost reporting principles in the same manner as other items and services used 
  for patients in such programs. 
<p><strong>The Use of DME Sales Agents</strong> 
<p>The proposed use of independent DME sales agents to provide sales and service 
  support to some customers raises different issues. Sales agents are in the business 
  of recommending or arranging for the purchase of the items or services they 
  offer for sale on behalf of their principals, typically manufacturers, or other 
  sellers (collectively, "Sellers"). Accordingly, any compensation arrangement 
  between a Seller and an independent sales agent for the purpose of selling health 
  care items or services that are directly or indirectly reimbursable by a Federal 
  health care program potentially implicates the anti-kickback statute, irrespective 
  of the methodology used to compensate the agent. Moreover, because such agents 
  are independent contractors, they are less accountable to the Seller than an 
  employee. <u>See</u> 56 Fed. Reg. 35952, 35981 (July 29, 1991); 54 Fed. Reg. 
  3088, 3093 (Jan. 23, 1989). For these reasons, this Office has a longstanding 
  concern with independent sales agency arrangements. 
<p>In some circumstances, our concerns can be addressed by structuring a sales 
  agency arrangement to fit in a safe harbor. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 56 Fed. Reg. at 
  35974. The Department of Health and Human Services has published safe harbor 
  regulations that protect certain arrangements that might otherwise technically 
  violate the anti-kickback statute from prosecution. <u>See</u> section 1128B(b)(3) 
  of the Act; 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The regulatory safe harbor potentially 
  applicable to the Proposed Arrangement is the personal services and management 
  contracts safe harbor. <u>See</u>42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d). The Proposed 
  Arrangement cannot qualify under this safe harbor, however, since the nature 
  of the services to be provided by the DME sales agents precludes an exact specification 
  of the schedule for performance of services and a determination of the total 
  aggregate compensation in advance, as required by the safe harbor regulation. 
<p>In reviewing sales arrangements that do not fit in the personal services and 
  management contracts safe harbor, this Office has identified several characteristics 
  of arrangements among Sellers, sales agents, and purchasers that appear to be 
  associated with an increased potential for program abuse, particularly overutilization 
  and excessive program costs. These suspect characteristics include, but are 
  not limited to: 
<p>-- compensation based on percentage of sales; 
<p>-- direct billing of a Federal health care program by the Seller for the item 
  or service sold by the sales agent; 
<p>-- direct contact between the sales agent and physicians in a position to order 
  items or services that are then paid for by a Federal health care program; 
<p>-- direct contact between the sales agent and Federal health care program beneficiaries; 
<p>-- use of sales agents who are health care professionals or persons in a similar 
  position to exert undue influence on purchasers or patients; and 
<p>-- marketing of items or services that are separately reimbursable by a Federal 
  health care program (e.g., items or services not included in the SNF PPS payment), 
  whether on the basis of charges or costs. 
<p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive, and the absence of any of these 
  factors certainly does not mean that a sales arrangement is permissible under 
  the anti-kickback statute. However, the more factors that are present, the greater 
  the scrutiny we ordinarily will give an arrangement. Of course, in all cases 
  the statute is not violated unless the parties have the requisite intent to 
  induce referrals. 
<p>In this case, while the sales agent compensation will be based on a percentage 
  of collections attributable to the Proposed Arrangement and may involve contact 
  between the sales agent and persons in a position to order the services, the 
  particular products being sold and rented, i.e., powered and non-powered mattresses, 
  are not separately reimbursable for patients in Medicare and Medicaid certified 
  nursing facilities and are used almost exclusively for SNF patients. To the 
  extent that the purchasers of the mattresses will be SNFs reimbursed under the 
  new Part A PPS, the cost of the mattresses will represent an expense to the 
  SNFs that must be covered by the fixed PPS payment and will necessarily reduce 
  the amount of profit for the SNF. Accordingly, the risk of overutilization and 
  excessive program costs will largely be offset by the inability of the SNFs 
  to pass on the costs of the items purchased to the Federal health care programs. 
  In addition, the percentage compensation to be paid to the DME sales agents 
  is a fixed percentage, which Company A has represented will be fair market value 
  in an arms-length transaction.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 
<p>In the circumstances of the Proposed Arrangement, the fact that the sales agents 
  may be marketing other products should not affect this conclusion. Because the 
  price for the therapeutic mattress package is fixed and collected by Company 
  A, there is no financial benefit to be gained by the DME sales agents from "swapping" 
  the Part A mattress arrangement for other Part B business or Part B business 
  for the Part A mattress business. 
<p>Finally, this opinion is premised on Company A's certifications that: (i) Company 
  A will have no financial arrangements with any SNF that participates in the 
  Proposed Arrangement apart from the Proposed Arrangement; and (ii) Company A 
  will have no commission-splitting or other financial arrangements with any of 
  the DME suppliers that will market the Proposed Arrangement, except as specifically 
  disclosed in the request for an advisory opinion. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION </strong> 
<p>Based on the facts certified in the request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Proposed Arrangement, as described in the advisory opinion request 
  and supplemental submissions, might constitute prohibited remuneration under 
  the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal 
  health care program business were present, but that the OIG will not subject 
  Company A to sanctions in connection with the Proposed Arrangement arising under 
  the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of 
  the Act.

<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. Company A has not previously rented the power mattress and has based its 
  fair market rental rate on rates for comparable products rented by other distributors; 
  we are not authorized to opine on "fair market value" (<u>see</u> section 1128D(b)(3) 
  of the Act) and therefore assume the truth of Company A's fair market value 
  certifications for purposes of this opinion. We express no opinion as to whether 
  the rental rates selected by Company A are, in fact, fair market value. If they 
  are not fair market value, this opinion is without force and effect. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. Company A has certified that the compensation rate is tentatively set at 
  20% and that it reserves the right to adjust the amount of compensation as necessary. 
  This opinion is limited to the compensation terms described in this advisory 
  opinion. We express no opinion about any different compensation terms. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. As we are not authorized to opine on "fair market value" (<u>see</u> section 
  1128D(b)(3) of the Act), we assume the truth of Company A's fair market value 
  certification for purposes of this opinion. If the certification is not true, 
  this opinion is without force and effect. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. The OIG will not hold Company A liable for omissions of the SNFs in connection 
  with their claims filing and reporting obligations, provided that Company A 
  does everything it reasonably can to ensure that the SNFs understand their obligations 
  to report the discount accurately. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. As noted above, we are not authorized to opine on "fair market value" in
