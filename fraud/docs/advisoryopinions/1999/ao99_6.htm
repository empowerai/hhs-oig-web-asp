<p align="center"><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-6</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>Ladies and Gentleman: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  the practice of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital ("St. Jude") of not billing 
  pediatric oncology patients for coinsurance and deductible amounts and the extension 
  of a variation of that practice to Hospital A and Hospital B (collectively, 
  the "Affiliates") pursuant to certain affiliation agreements with St. Jude (as 
  described in more detail in Part I below). Specifically, you have inquired whether 
  these practices (collectively, the "Billing Policy") constitute grounds for 
  sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security 
  Act (the "Act"), or under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act (civil money penalties 
  for illegal remuneration to beneficiaries) in the circumstances presented. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the information provided and subject to certain conditions described 
  below, we conclude: (i) that the Billing Policy could potentially generate prohibited 
  remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite intent to induce 
  referrals were present, but that the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will 
  not subject the Billing Policy as practiced by St. Jude or the Affiliates (as 
  described in the request letter and supplemental submissions) to sanctions arising 
  under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act; and (ii) that the OIG will not subject St. Jude or the Affiliates 
  to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Billing 
  Policy. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the Requesters<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part III below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 
  1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. St. Jude</strong> 
<p>Founded by actor Danny Thomas in 1962, St. Jude is a nationally-known, not-for-profit 
  pediatric facility dedicated to finding cures for children with catastrophic 
  illnesses through research and treatment. St. Jude specializes in research involving 
  pediatric cancers, acquired and inherited immuno-deficiencies, and genetic disorders. 
<p>Children come to St. Jude from across the nation and around the world. To be 
  eligible for services at St. Jude, children must be referred by a physician, 
  usually a community-based pediatrician. Typically, children are accepted for 
  treatment at St. Jude based solely on their eligibility and willingness to participate 
  in various research protocols developed by St. Jude, the Children's Cancer Group 
  ("CCG"), or the Pediatric Oncology Group ("POG").<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  Children are eligible if there is an open research protocol and if they have 
  not received prior treatment for their illness.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p>Generally, physicians who treat patients at St. Jude are full-time, salaried 
  faculty members of St. Jude.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Salaries for 
  these physicians are fixed annually and do not vary based on the volume or value 
  of services the physicians provide or order. In addition to treating patients, 
  the physicians conduct laboratory-based research and develop clinical research 
  treatment protocols directed toward improving patient outcomes. None of the 
  employed physicians is permitted to have an outside medical practice. 
<p>St. Jude treats approximately 600 children each year, of whom approximately 
  400 have cancer and the rest have other catastrophic illnesses. Many of these 
  children experience extended and/or repeated hospital stays. While new developments 
  in treatment methods have enabled an increasing number of children to be treated 
  on an outpatient ambulatory basis, many patients are still required to travel 
  to, and stay in, Memphis for St. Jude's diagnostic studies and treatment. To 
  defray costs for families during the course of treatment, St. Jude sponsors 
  a comprehensive domiciliary care program funded entirely by philanthropic sources 
  to provide meals, housing, and transportation for children and families. 
<p>St. Jude receives more than half of its total operating revenues (totaling 
  approximately $167 million in 1998) from volunteer contributions raised by the 
  American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities ("ALSAC"), a not-for-profit foundation 
  established in 1957 that operates in support of St. Jude. For the six year period 
  from 1994 through 1998, for example, approximately 55% of St. Jude's operating 
  expenses (excluding depreciation) were covered through ALSAC's philanthropic 
  support. The remainder of its operating funds comes from third party payers 
  (including Medicaid and CHAMPUS<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>), research 
  grants (including grants from the National Institutes of Health), and investments 
  or other miscellaneous sources. For example, for fiscal year 1998, the revenue 
  mix was as follows: philanthropy (51.4%), third party payers (28.3%), research 
  grants (16.2%), and investments/other (4.1%). In general, third-party payments 
  -- both public and private -- are insufficient to cover the patient care costs 
  incurred by St. Jude for insured children. With respect to Federal program beneficiaries, 
  for example, St. Jude expected to recover in fiscal year 1998 only about 25 
  cents for every dollar it incurred in patient care costs. 
<p>St. Jude also provides a significant amount of charity care for uninsured children, 
  who comprise approximately 20% of its patient population. In fiscal year 1998, 
  St. Jude provided the equivalent of approximately $20 million in medical care 
  to these children, or roughly 12% of its total operating revenues. In addition, 
  consistent with its research mission, St. Jude provides substantial experimental 
  and investigational care that generally is not covered by Federal or private 
  health insurance programs. 
<p><strong>B. St. Jude's Billing Policy</strong> 
<p>Since its inception, St. Jude has never billed children or their families for 
  any part of the cost of their medical care. This policy provides financial relief 
  to families of children with chronic and severe diseases for whom the costs 
  of care might otherwise be prohibitive and enhances participation in, and compliance 
  with, St. Jude's research protocols. <br>
  <br>
<p>Because its patient population is limited to children, very few of whom are 
  eligible for Medicare coverage, St. Jude does not participate in the Medicare 
  program. However, it bills Medicaid, which imposes no cost-sharing amounts on 
  children under age eighteen,<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and CHAMPUS. 
  In total, for fiscal year 1998, St. Jude waived less than $20,000 in Medicaid 
  and CHAMPUS deductibles and coinsurance amounts ($[x] for Medicaid and $[y] 
  for CHAMPUS). These copayment amounts were owed in connection with approximately 
  $6.3 million in Medicaid and CHAMPUS receipts (approximately $6.2 million from 
  Medicaid and $115,000 from CHAMPUS). The costs for delivering services to this 
  Federal patient population were almost $25.1 million, necessitating an infusion 
  of significant philanthropic resources from ALSAC for these children. 
<p>St. Jude neither advertises nor markets the Billing Policy to prospective patients, 
  their families, or referring physicians. Nor is the Billing Policy part of a 
  price reduction agreement between St. Jude and any third-party payer. The Billing 
  Policy applies to all patients, without regard to the reason for the patient's 
  inpatient or outpatient visit, the length of the patient's hospital stay, or 
  the patient's Diagnosis Related Group ("DRG") code or outpatient procedure. 
  St. Jude does not claim amounts attributable to unbilled coinsurance as bad 
  debt on its Federal program cost reports, and it does not shift these costs 
  to other third-party payers in the form of higher rates or charges. 
<p><strong>C. The St. Jude Affiliated Hospitals </strong> 
<p>Historically, to avail themselves of St. Jude's cutting edge research and treatment, 
  children and their families have had to be at St. Jude. In many cases, this 
  has meant that children and families have had to relocate temporarily to Memphis, 
  sometimes on multiple occasions, resulting in a significant financial burden 
  (sometimes including lost jobs for parents needing extended leave) and disruption 
  to family life, including separation of sick children from parents and siblings. 
<p>To expand the number of children receiving St. Jude services and to ease the 
  financial and other burdens associated with participating in St. Jude-sponsored 
  research, St. Jude has entered into affiliation arrangements with several providers 
  in the Mid-South region of the country. Pursuant to these affiliations, St. 
  Jude clinics are established at the affiliated facility; eligible children can 
  participate in St. Jude's research program and receive treatment and monitoring 
  through the clinics. In some cases, children will receive all of their medical 
  care at the local facility; in other cases, children will receive some care 
  at the local facility, but will also travel to St. Jude in Memphis to receive 
  specialized care not available locally, such as molecular diagnosis, bone marrow 
  transplants, and limb salvage procedures. 
<p>Application of the Billing Policy by two affiliates is also the subject of 
  this advisory opinion. The requesting affiliates are Hospital A ("Hospital A"), 
  a not-for-profit children's hospital in City A, State A, and Hospital B ("Hospital 
  B"), a not-for-profit acute care facility in City B, State B. Hospital A and 
  Hospital B are collectively the "Affiliates" for purposes of this opinion. 
<p>Each Affiliate has entered into one or more agreements with St. Jude to provide 
  pediatric oncology services locally under the auspices of St. Jude.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
  The two Affiliate arrangements have common elements. Both involve the establishment 
  of a distinct pediatric oncology clinic for "St. Jude Patients" being treated 
  at the Affiliate. "St. Jude Patients" are patients who have been accepted at 
  the St. Jude-affiliated clinic based on the same criteria that apply to patients 
  enrolled and treated at St. Jude. In 1998, each Affiliate admitted approximately 
  50 St. Jude Patients. Like children treated at St. Jude, most St. Jude Patients 
  will be enrolled on a St. Jude, CCG, or POG protocol, although some children 
  for whom these protocols are not appropriate may be treated under pre-established 
  treatment plans. 
<p>St. Jude will review and monitor all treatment provided at the Affiliates' 
  clinics and ensure compliance with eligibility criteria and protocol requirements. 
  Each Affiliate clinic will be staffed by a salaried physician who will act as 
  a "gatekeeper" for all items and services provided to St. Jude Patients, reviewing 
  and signing all orders and prescriptions for St. Jude Patients. At Hospital 
  B, the gatekeeper physician will be employed by St. Jude. The gatekeeper physician 
  at Hospital A will be a Hospital A employee. In both instances, the gatekeeper 
  physicians' salaries will be set in advance annually and will not vary directly 
  or indirectly based on the volume or value of items or services provided or 
  ordered for St. Jude patients.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>D. The Billing Policy as Applied to the Affiliates</strong> 
<p>Pursuant to their agreements with St. Jude, the Affiliates follow St. Jude's 
  Billing Policy and do not bill St. Jude Patients or their families. As with 
  St. Jude, the Billing Policy is not advertised or marketed by the Affiliates 
  to prospective patients or referring physicians. Nor is the Billing Policy part 
  of a price reduction agreement between the Affiliates and any third-party payer. 
  The Billing Policy applies to all St. Jude patients, regardless of the reason 
  for the patient's inpatient or outpatient visit, the length of the patient's 
  hospital stay, or the patient's DRG code or outpatient procedure. The Affiliates 
  have certified that they do not claim amounts attributable to unbilled coinsurance 
  as bad debt on their Medicare or Medicaid cost reports, and they do not shift 
  these costs to other third-party payers through higher rates or charges. The 
  Billing Policy will be disclosed to all third-party payers.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
<p>The Affiliates participate in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHAMPUS programs. 
  However, virtually all Federal health care program coinsurance amounts waived 
  pursuant to the Billing Policy arise under Medicaid.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
  For example, for fiscal year 1998, Hospital A waived a total of [less than $600] 
  in Medicaid copayments and no CHAMPUS copayments. Hospital B waived no Federal 
  coinsurance amounts for any St. Jude Patients for the period from July 1997 
  through December 1998.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
<p>ALSAC has agreed to pay all deductible and coinsurance amounts for St. Jude 
  Patients enrolled at the Affiliates.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> ALSAC 
  anticipates that its copayment obligations, mostly on behalf of private pay 
  patients, will equal approximately two percent of the Affiliates' gross revenues. 
  The Affiliates will submit an itemized bill for such copayments to ALSAC on 
  a quarterly basis, and ALSAC will pay such copayments in a timely manner. In 
  connection with its coinsurance payment obligation and pursuant to the affiliation 
  agreements, ALSAC and St. Jude will audit and monitor the Affiliates' utilization 
  of services for St. Jude Patients. 
<p><strong>II. ST. JUDE'S WAIVER POLICY IMPLICATES THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE</strong>, 
  <strong>BUT WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO OIG SANCTIONS.</strong> 
<p><strong>A. Applicable Law and Guidance</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> 
<p>Waivers of Federal health care program coinsurance and deductible amounts implicate 
  the anti-kickback statute because such waivers may constitute an inducement 
  to beneficiaries to use services in exchange for something of value, i.e., the 
  forgiveness of a financial obligation. <br>
  <br>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has published "safe harbor" regulations 
  that define practices that are not subject to the anti-kickback statute because 
  such practices would unlikely result in fraud or abuse. <u>See</u> section 1128B(b)(3) 
  of the Act; 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions 
  that, if met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned 
  for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection 
  is only afforded to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions 
  set forth in the safe harbor. Potentially applicable here is the safe harbor 
  for waivers of inpatient Part A coinsurance and deductibles where the Medicare 
  program pays a hospital under the prospective payment system. <u>See</u> 42 
  C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(k). 
<p>In a Special Fraud Alert issued in May 1991, we stated that providers who routinely 
  waive Medicare Part B coinsurance and deductibles may be held liable under the 
  anti-kickback statute. <u>See</u> Special Fraud Alert, 59 Fed. Reg. 242 (published 
  in the <u>Federal Register</u> in 1994).<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> 
  When providers forgive financial obligations for reasons other than genuine 
  financial hardship of the particular patient, they may be unlawfully inducing 
  the patient to purchase items or services in violation of the anti-kickback 
  statute's proscription against offering or paying something of value as an inducement 
  to generate business payable by a Federal health care program. We noted that 
  waivers of coinsurance and deductibles may make beneficiaries less conscientious 
  health care consumers, selecting services simply because they are free, rather 
  than because they are medically necessary. Thus, routine waivers of Medicare 
  Part B coinsurance and deductibles are suspect under the anti-kickback statute. 
<p><strong>B. Analysis</strong> 
<p><strong>1. The Billing Policy with Respect to Part A Inpatient Coinsurance 
  Does Not Meet the Safe Harbor Requirements.</strong> 
<p>The safe harbor for routine Part A coinsurance waivers applies where a hospital 
  is paid by Medicare on a prospective payment basis, and the hospital satisfies 
  three standards enumerated in the regulation at 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(k). 
  By its terms, the safe harbor does not apply to waivers of Medicaid or CHAMPUS 
  coinsurance amounts. Therefore, the safe harbor does not protect the Billing 
  Policy. 
<p><strong>2. The Billing Policy as Practiced by St. Jude Will Not Result in OIG 
  Sanctions Under the Anti-Kickback Statute.</strong> 
<p>Although the Billing Policy as practiced by St. Jude might violate the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent were present, we conclude that we will not seek 
  to impose sanctions on St. Jude arising under the anti-kickback statute in the 
  particular circumstances presented here. 
<p>This conclusion rests in the first instance on a recognition that St. Jude's 
  Billing Policy is a singular vestige of St. Jude's founding and continuing charitable 
  research mission. The Billing Policy predates the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
  and has been consistently applied to all patients. Moreover, the Billing Policy 
  is an integral component of St. Jude's extra-ordinary commitment to charitable 
  care and medical research. This institutional history merits a deference to 
  the Billing Policy that would be inappropriate for an identical policy implemented 
  today. 
<p>Standing alone, an institutional history will not protect an otherwise improper 
  practice from sanctions under the anti-kickback statute. In this case, however, 
  that history is conjoined with certain aspects of St. Jude's organization that, 
  taken together, reduce the risk that the Billing Policy will result in overutilization 
  or unnecessary services. Most significantly, 99% of physician care at St. Jude 
  is provided by salaried physicians whose compensation does not vary directly 
  or indirectly based on the volume or value of items or services they order or 
  perform and who do not have outside medical practices; the remaining 1% of services 
  are provided by contracted specialists whose compensation is fixed in advance. 
  This compensation arrangement significantly reduces any personal financial incentive 
  to provide unnecessary services to patients. In addition, the highly specialized 
  services provided by St. Jude reduce the likelihood of self-referral to the 
  hospital or its physicians.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
<p>Finally, the fact that St. Jude's primary mission is the research of childhood 
  diseases presents the following special considerations: 
<ul>
  <li>Because much of the children's treatment is dictated by peer-reviewed clinical 
    protocols, there is some protection against overutilization of services.</li>
  <li>Given the significant additional burdens on patients of participating in 
    St. Jude's research, waiving copayments is a reasonable means of inducing 
    participation and on-going compliance with protocol requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>St. Jude's research results in a substantial public benefit.</li>
  <li>The Billing Policy, which is uniformly applied to all patients, affects 
    very few Federal health care program beneficiaries, and the amounts of Federal 
    copayments waived are relatively insubstantial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the totality of these factors, including the potential benefits of 
  the Billing Policy and the safeguards described in the preceding three paragraphs, 
  we conclude that we will not subject St. Jude to sanctions arising under the 
  anti-kickback statute in connection with the Billing Policy.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>3. The Billing Policy as Practiced by the Affiliates Will Not Result 
  in OIG Sanctions Under the Anti-Kickback Statute.</strong> 
<p>The Billing Policy as applied by the Affiliates requires a somewhat different 
  analysis. As a technical matter, there is no waiver of copayments by the Affiliates, 
  since ALSAC is accepting responsibility to pay for any applicable copayments.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> 
  Nonetheless, the Billing Policy could implicate the anti-kickback statute, because 
  it provides a financial benefit to St. Jude Patients being treated at the Affiliates 
  and could be an inducement to self-refer. In addition, the Billing Policy, including 
  the payment of copayments by ALSAC, could potentially induce referrals by the 
  Affiliates to St. Jude. 
<p>Turning to the first of our concerns -- whether the Billing Policy is an inducement 
  to patients to self-refer -- our analysis is essentially the same as for the 
  Billing Policy at St. Jude. Safeguards at the Affiliates are comparable to those 
  at St. Jude, including the fact that patients can only be seen if referred by 
  a community physician; that they must meet St. Jude's medical eligibility criteria, 
  including protocol requirements; and that the scope of services is generally 
  governed by protocols. As at St. Jude, the number of St. Jude Patients for whom 
  copayments are waived is small in comparison to the total number of St. Jude 
  Patients, and there is a strong public benefit from the research promoted by 
  the affiliation arrangements, including faster research results due to enrollment 
  of more patients in St. Jude's research program. 
<p>Our second concern is with potential inducements to the Affiliates to refer 
  patients to St. Jude. By arranging for ALSAC to cover patients' coinsurance 
  obligations, St. Jude confers a benefit on the Affiliates that, if done with 
  the intent to induce referrals, could potentially violate the anti-kickback 
  statute. By way of example, an arrangement between a hospital and a physician 
  whereby the hospital pays the physician's patients' copayments to induce referrals 
  from the physician (who could, in turn, advertise the arrangement to attract 
  patients or simply avoid collection costs, including bad debt) would implicate 
  the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>Three factors suggest that the Billing Policy, although potentially remuneration 
  to the Affiliates, poses a minimal risk of Federal health care program fraud 
  or abuse in the circumstances presented. <u>First</u>, the benefit, if any, 
  to the Affiliates of ALSAC's assumption of the copayment obligation is minimal, 
  since it merely puts the Affiliates in the same position they would have been 
  in absent the affiliation with St. Jude, i.e., able to collect copayments for 
  services rendered to pediatric cancer patients. While the arrangement may result 
  in some avoided costs for the Affiliates (e.g., bad debt, costs of collection), 
  such amounts are likely to be relatively small and speculative. This benefit, 
  if any, is likely to be far less significant to the Affiliates than the mere 
  affiliation with St. Jude itself, which enables Affiliates to make St. Jude's 
  treatment and research available locally. Such benefit is separate and apart 
  from the Billing Policy. <br>
  <br>
<p><u>Second</u>, while we cannot determine a party's intent, we think it is implausible 
  that St. Jude would arrange for ALSAC to pay copayments in order to generate 
  referrals of Federal program business from the Affiliates. Simply put, if St. 
  Jude wanted referrals of children from the Affiliates it would not have entered 
  into the affiliations in the first place. In fact, the affiliation arrangements 
  are designed to <u>minimize</u> referrals to St. Jude, making St. Jude's research 
  more economical by reducing costs associated with patient care and expanding 
  participation in research studies through a more convenient and less burdensome 
  arrangement for patients. 
<p><u>Third</u>, there is little risk that referrals from the Affiliates, if any, 
  would result in inappropriate utilization or increased program costs at St. 
  Jude, since the Affiliates have no interest in referring children to St. Jude 
  unless they cannot provide the services themselves, and virtually all children 
  referred to St. Jude will be subject to research protocols. Of the children 
  who are referred, the majority typically will need experimental and investigational 
  procedures not generally covered by Federal or private insurance. Moreover, 
  St. Jude and ALSAC have a significant financial incentive to monitor utilization 
  for St. Jude Patients so as to keep ALSAC's copayments to a minimum. 
<p>For all of these reasons and because there is a substantial public benefit 
  from expanded research into childhood cancer, we conclude that the OIG will 
  not subject the Affiliates to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute 
  in connection with the Billing Policy. 
<p><strong>III. NEITHER ST. JUDE NOR THE AFFILIATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL MONETARY 
  PENALTIES UNDER SECTION 1128A(a)(5) OF THE ACT.</strong> 
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act prohibits a person from offering or transferring 
  remuneration to a beneficiary that such person knows or should know is likely 
  to influence the beneficiary to order items or services from a particular provider 
  or supplier for which payment may be made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
  "Remuneration" is defined as including the waiver of coinsurance and deductible 
  amounts, with exceptions for certain financial hardship waivers, which are not 
  prohibited. The Billing Policy as practiced by both St. Jude and the Affiliates 
  could potentially influence Medicaid beneficiaries to seek treatment at St. 
  Jude or an Affiliate and thus potentially implicates section 1128A(a)(5). However, 
  for the reasons stated above in Section II(B), the OIG will not subject St. 
  Jude or the Affiliates to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in 
  connection with the Billing Policy. 
<p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>For the above reasons and based on the facts as certified in the request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, we conclude: (i) that the Billing Policy could 
  potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the OIG will 
  not subject the Billing Policy as practiced by St. Jude or the Affiliates (as 
  described in the request letter and supplemental submissions) to sanctions arising 
  under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) 
  of the Act; and (ii) that the OIG will not subject St. Jude or the Affiliates 
  to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Billing 
  Policy.

<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. For purposes of this advisory opinion, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 
  Hospital A, and Hospital B are, collectively, the "Requesters". <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. CCG is a national cooperative research organization founded in 1995 that 
  is funded primarily by the National Institutes of Health and the National Childhood 
  Cancer Foundation. POG, founded in 1980, is a National Cancer Institute-sponsored 
  clinical trial cooperative. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. Open research protocols exist for most common forms of childhood cancer. 
  Children enrolled at St. Jude in the absence of a protocol fall into two categories: 
  children in St. Jude's Memphis service area with rare forms of cancer that are 
  not the subject of any on-going protocol and children outside the service area 
  with similar rare cancers that also are not the subject of open protocols and 
  whose cancers cannot be treated elsewhere. For these children, treatment is 
  dictated by a management plan or multi-disciplinary group plan established at 
  the time the child is accepted for treatment. These children participate in 
  St. Jude's research through contributions of tumor tissue, normal tissue, and 
  blood for laboratory research into the causes and biological characteristics 
  of childhood cancer. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. St. Jude contracts with a small number of specialists to provide services 
  to St. Jude patients on an as-needed basis in areas, such as urology, where 
  St. Jude generally has a limited need. These physicians provide only approximately 
  1% of the services furnished to children at St. Jude. All services are provided 
  "under arrangement" pursuant to written contracts that provide for compensation 
  that is fixed in advance. The specialists assign their rights to third-party 
  reimbursement to St. Jude. <a name="N_5_"></a> <br>
  <br>
<p>5. The Department of Defense CHAMPUS program has been renamed Tricare. For 
  purposes of this advisory opinion, we will refer to the program as CHAMPUS. 
  <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. The Act generally permits states to impose "nominal" cost-sharing requirements 
  on Medicaid beneficiaries; however, no cost-sharing amounts are allowed for 
  individuals under age 18. <u>See</u>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396o; 42 C.F.R. &#167; 
  447.53(b)(1) (1998). St. Jude treats a limited number of patients above age 
  18, primarily young people undergoing extended treatments. The Medicaid statute 
  permits states to exercise several options concerning coinsurance and deductibles. 
  In some states, the restriction on cost-sharing could extend to age 21. <u>See</u> 
  <u>id.</u> The relevant rules are contained in the Medicaid state plan for the 
  state in which the Medicaid recipient resides. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 435.403. 
  <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. In general, the Affiliate arrangements involve various services, management, 
  and rental agreements. St. Jude and the Affiliates have certified that all compensation 
  under these agreements represents, and will continue to represent, fair market 
  value in an arms-length transaction and is not and will not be based on the 
  volume or value of business generated between the parties. The Billing Policy 
  is the sole subject of this advisory opinion; we express no opinion about any 
  other agreements between or among the Requesters or any other parties, including, 
  but not limited to, agreements with physicians affiliated with any of the Requesters. 
  <a name="N_8_"></a> 
<p>8. To ensure that this condition is satisfied, St. Jude has certified that 
  it will obtain an annual certification from the Affiliates that will include 
  a summary analysis of the annual compensation received by the gatekeeper physicians 
  and that it will audit the operations of the Affiliates at two year intervals 
  to confirm compliance with the compensation restrictions. <a name="N_9_"></a> 
<p>9. Third-party payers will be informed of the Billing Policy. We express no 
  opinion regarding the liability of any party under the False Claims Act or other 
  legal authorities for any improper billing, claims submission, or other related 
  conduct. <a name="N_10_"></a> 
<p>10. For fiscal year 1998, Hospital A has reported a singular case of a Medicare 
  disability beneficiary being treated for a malignant tumor for whom copayments 
  were waived in the amount of [less than $3,000]. The patient was originally 
  treated at St. Jude. <a name="N_11_"></a> 
<p>11. Hospital B reported no Medicare or CHAMPUS patients for that period. It 
  identified approximately 400 inpatient and outpatient occasions of service related 
  to Medicaid patients. However, the Louisiana Medicaid program does not impose 
  any deductible or coinsurance obligations. Hospital B reported having no out-of-state 
  pediatric cancer patients who might be subject to coinsurance obligations. <a name="N_12_"></a> 
<p>12. ALSAC will not cover other losses incurred by the Affiliates in connection 
  with uninsured patients or patients obtaining procedures not covered by the 
  patient's insurance. These patients will be treated in accordance with the Affiliates' 
  existing charity care policies or they may be referred to St. Jude for treatment. 
  <a name="N_13_"></a> 
<p>13. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a name="N_14_"></a> 
<p>14. <sup>14</sup>The Special Fraud Alert specifically addressed charge-based 
  providers; however, the Fraud Alert notes that it should not be construed as 
  endorsing, by omission, routine waivers of Medicare copayments by providers 
  paid under prospective payment or cost-based systems. <a name="N_15_"></a> 
<p>15. St. Jude has certified that the Billing Policy is not advertised or marketed 
  to patients or physicians. However, it is likely that many pediatricians and 
  oncologists practicing in areas from which St. Jude draws patients may be aware 
  of St. Jude's Billing Policy, either from experience with St. Jude or as a result 
  of ALSAC activities on behalf of St. Jude. <a name="N_16_"></a> 
<p>16. We note that 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1079 appears to permit waivers of CHAMPUS 
  copayments in situations similar to those present here. Given our conclusion, 
  we need not consider whether that statute applies to the Billing Policy as practiced 
  by St. Jude. <a name="N_17_"></a> 
<p>17. ALSAC is a 501(c)(3) charitable entity unrelated to the Affiliates. We 
  note that a similar payment arrangement between ALSAC and St. Jude, which are 
  related, would be analyzed as a routine waiver of coinsurance, as it would have 
  the practical effect of simply moving money from one pocket to another. Such 
  payments would provide no meaningful check on potential overutilization. <p>
