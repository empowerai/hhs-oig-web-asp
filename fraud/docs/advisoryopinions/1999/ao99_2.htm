<p>OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-2 <br>
  <br>
<p>Dear [name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  certain arrangements for discounted ambulance services provided to residents 
  of Medicare skilled nursing facilities (collectively, the "Arrangement"). You 
  have asked whether the Arrangement would result in prohibited remuneration under 
  the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the 
  "Act") or would constitute grounds for the imposition of sanctions under the 
  anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the exclusion authority 
  related to kickbacks, section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty 
  provision for kickbacks, section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Arrangement might constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal health care program 
  business were present and might be subject to sanctions arising under sections 
  1128B(b), 1128(b)(7), and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, as well as section 1128(b)(6)(A) 
  of the Act. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the addressee and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part III below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>Ambulance Reimbursement Under the SNF Prospective Payment System</strong> 
<p>The genesis of the Arrangement is Medicare's new prospective payment system 
  for Medicare-certified skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"). In 1997, Congress 
  significantly changed the way SNFs are reimbursed for services to patients covered 
  under Medicare Part A, the hospital benefit.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Specifically, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted a prospective payment 
  system ("PPS") for SNFs covering all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital) 
  related to services furnished to beneficiaries covered under Part A, including 
  certain Part B services.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Other Part B services 
  will continue to be reimbursed separately to the providers of such services 
  pending implementation of a new consolidated billing system.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p>The basic PPS methodology is a prospectively fixed per diem payment adjusted 
  to reflect the patient's health status and needs and the regional wage rate 
  (the "Federal case mix adjusted rate"). Under PPS, the SNF per diem payment 
  will include payment for certain ancillary Part B services previously reimbursed 
  by Medicare directly to the providers of such services. This new payment scheme 
  shifts risk to the SNFs, giving them a significant financial incentive to reduce 
  costs, and may indirectly result in lower payments to suppliers and providers 
  of items and services covered by the PPS payment. <br>
  <br>
<p>Among the Part B services affected by the change in SNF reimbursement are ambulance 
  services. Traditionally, ambulance services rendered to Medicare patients residing 
  in SNFs have been covered by Medicare Part B and reimbursed on a reasonable 
  charge basis. Under PPS, ambulance services that are within the normal scope 
  of the patient's plan of care ("Plan of Care Ambulance Services") are included 
  in the fixed PPS per diem payment. SNFs must provide the Plan of Care Ambulance 
  Services directly or "under arrangement" with an ambulance company.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  Plan of Care Ambulance Services comprise a relatively small portion of the ambulance 
  services required by most SNF Part A patients, and an even smaller portion of 
  the total ambulance services required by SNF patients generally.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  Pending full implementation of consolidated billing, Medicare will continue 
  to reimburse ambulance providers for non-PPS covered ambulance services for 
  Part A patients and for services for Medicare patients whose stays are not covered 
  under Part A,<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> based on reasonable charges 
  for services provided until January 1, 2000, and on a fee schedule thereafter.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
<p>In sum, pursuant to SNF PPS, Medicare will pay SNFs a fixed per diem amount 
  for patients during a covered Part A stay, and the SNFs will be responsible 
  for paying for virtually all patient care services -- including Plan of Care 
  Ambulance Services -- out of that fixed payment. These PPS-covered ambulance 
  services are the subject of the Arrangement at issue here. 
<p><strong>The Arrangement</strong> 
<p>The Arrangement involves an agreement for PPS-covered ambulance services between 
  Ambulance Company X ("Ambulance Company X") and Nursing Home Y (the "Nursing 
  Home"). Ambulance Company X is a Medicare-certified ambulance supplier operating 
  in the State A market. The Nursing Home is a Medicare-certified SNF paid under 
  PPS for patients covered by Medicare Part A. With the advent of PPS, the Nursing 
  Home has arranged for Ambulance Company X to provide Plan of Care Ambulance 
  Services for its PPS-covered patients "under arrangement". In addition to its 
  PPS-covered patients, the Nursing Home has patients who require ambulance services 
  that are not covered by a PPS payment and that are reimbursed to the ambulance 
  services provider by Medicare under Part B or by other payers. 
<p>Ambulance Company X and the Nursing Home have entered into a Medical Transportation 
  Services Agreement (the "Agreement") for the provision of Plan of Care Ambulance 
  Services and chair car services to Nursing Home residents who are covered under 
  the PPS system. The Agreement also applies to Nursing Home residents for whom 
  the Nursing Home is reimbursed by other public or private reimbursement systems 
  under a capitated, per-diem, or other all-inclusive payment that includes ambulance 
  services and residents for whom the Nursing Home otherwise agrees to be financially 
  responsible. In other words, the Agreement applies when the Nursing Home bears 
  the risk for providing ambulance services. 
<p>Pursuant to the Agreement, Ambulance Company X will charge the Nursing Home 
  fixed per-transport rates for basic life support ("BLS"), advanced life support 
  ("ALS"), and chair car services. The contractual rates for BLS and ALS services 
  represent discounts of up to 50% of the "reasonable charge" established by Medicare 
  for Ambulance Company X's services in the State A area.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
  Ambulance Company X will charge Medicare its full usual and customary amount 
  for transporting Nursing Home residents for whom ambulance services are covered 
  under Medicare Part B. 
<p>With respect to the amount of the discount, Ambulance Company X has represented 
  that part of the proposed discount would be directly attributable to cost savings 
  Ambulance Company X can achieve when providing services for PPS residents. For 
  example, Ambulance Company X has certified that its billing costs should be 
  substantially less for services for PPS-covered residents because Ambulance 
  Company X will submit a single, consolidated bill to each SNF at the end of 
  each month and because Ambulance Company X will not need to bill residents for 
  copayments or deductibles. Ambulance Company X also believes its collection 
  rate will generally be higher for PPS residents. Ambulance Company X estimates 
  that these factors can reasonably be expected to result in savings equal to 
  approximately 10% of the Medicare reasonable charge for each transport rendered 
  to a PPS resident, depending on the circumstances. Nonetheless, in light of 
  the competitive market, Ambulance Company X is offering discounts in excess 
  of anticipated savings attributable substantially to SNF PPS. 
<p>Ambulance Company X proposes entering into similar discount arrangements with 
  other SNFs in its service area. Like Ambulance Company X's arrangement with 
  the Nursing Home, these proposed discount arrangements would be with SNFs that 
  are being reimbursed for Medicare Part A services under PPS and would apply 
  to ambulance transports provided to the Medicare residents during a covered 
  Part A stay. The discounts would not apply to Part B services. The discount 
  arrangement between Ambulance Company X and the Nursing Home and the proposed 
  discount arrangements between Ambulance Company X and other SNFs described in 
  the request letter are collectively referred to in this opinion letter as the 
  "Arrangement". 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p><strong>The Anti-Kickback Statute</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback 
  statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for referral of services or to 
  induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F. 2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F. 2d 68 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir.), 
  <u>cert. denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes 
  a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years 
  or both. Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate 
  administrative proceedings to exclude persons from Federal health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute contains a statutory exception for "a discount or 
  other reduction in price obtained by a provider of services or other entity 
  under a Federal health care program if the reduction in price is properly disclosed 
  and appropriately reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider 
  or entity under a Federal health care program." 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b)(3)(A). 
  This discount exception reflects the intent of Congress to encourage price competition 
  that benefits the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Department of Health and 
  Human Services has published regulations implementing this discount "safe harbor" 
  exception. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h). 
<p><strong>The Discount Pricing</strong> <strong>Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Our initial inquiry is whether the Arrangement fits within the discount safe 
  harbor. We conclude it does not. The statutory exception for discounts, as implemented 
  by the regulatory safe harbor, does not protect price reductions -- like those 
  at issue here -- offered to one payer but not offered to Medicare or Medicaid. 
  In the preamble to the discount safe harbor, we illustrated the potential problem 
  with such price reductions: 
<p>[W]e are aware of cases where laboratories offer a discount to physicians who 
  then bill the patient, but do not offer the same discount to the Medicare program. 
  In some of these cases, the discount offered to the physician is explicitly 
  conditioned on the physician's referral of all of his or her laboratory business. 
  Such a "discount" does not benefit Medicare, and is therefore inconsistent with 
  the statutory intent for discounts to be reported to the programs with costs 
  and charges reduced appropriately to reflect the discounts. <br>
  <br>
<p>56 Fed. Reg. 35977 (July 29, 1991). In essence, such price reductions create 
  a risk that a supplier may be offering remuneration in the form of discounts 
  on business for which the purchaser pays the supplier, in exchange for the opportunity 
  to service and bill for higher paying Federal health care program business reimbursed 
  directly by the program to the supplier. In such circumstances, neither Medicare 
  nor Medicaid benefits from the discount; to the contrary, Medicare and Medicaid 
  may, in effect, subsidize the other payer's discounted rates.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
  Moreover, suppliers may have an incentive to inappropriately increase utilization 
  or engage in abusive billing practices to recoup losses on the discounted business. 
  Accordingly, the discount safe harbor specifically excludes "[a] reduction in 
  price applicable to one payor but not to Medicare or a State health care program." 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(h)(3)(iii). 
<p>Having concluded that the Arrangement does not fit in the safe harbor, we must 
  consider whether the discount arrangement between Ambulance Company X and the 
  Nursing Home and similar arrangements with other SNFs may involve illegal remuneration 
  for the SNFs' referrals of ambulance business not covered by the PPS payment 
  and not subject to the discount. We conclude that they may. 
<p>The circumstances surrounding the Arrangement suggest that a nexus may exist 
  between the discount to the SNFs for PPS-covered transports and referrals of 
  other Federal health care program business.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
  <u>First</u>, the SNFs are in a position to direct a significant amount of business 
  to Ambulance Company X that is not covered by the PPS payment. <u>Second</u>, 
  both parties have obvious motives for agreeing to trade discounts on PPS business 
  for referrals of non-PPS business: the SNFs to minimize risk of losses under 
  the PPS system and Ambulance Company X to secure business in a highly competitive 
  market. <u>Third</u>, Ambulance Company X's request for an advisory opinion 
  comes amidst a considerable number of informal inquiries and anecdotal reports 
  regarding discounts to SNFs that this Office has received since enactment of 
  SNF PPS. These inquiries and reports suggest that suppliers of a wide range 
  of SNF services are giving SNFs discounts for PPS-covered business that are 
  linked, directly or indirectly, to referrals of Part B business. 
<p>In evaluating whether an improper nexus exists between a discount and referrals 
  of Federal business in a particular arrangement, we look for indicia that the 
  discount is not commercially reasonable in the absence of other, non-discounted 
  business. In this regard, discounts on SNF PPS business that are particularly 
  suspect include, but are not limited to: 
<ul>
  <li>discounted prices that are below the supplier's cost,<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> 
    and</li>
  <li>discounted prices that are lower than the prices that the supplier offers 
    to a buyer that (i) generates a volume of business for the supplier that is 
    the same or greater than the volume of Part A business generated by the PPS 
    SNF, but (ii) does not have any potentially available Part B or other Federal 
    health care program business. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an illustrative, not exhaustive, list of suspect discounts; other arrangements 
  may be equally suspect. Each of the above pricing arrangements independently 
  gives rise to an inference that the supplier and the SNF may be "swapping" discounts 
  on Part A business in exchange for profitable non-discounted Part B business, 
  from which the supplier can recoup losses incurred on the discounted business, 
  potentially through overutilization or abusive billing practices. <u>In connection 
  with items or services provided to PPS SNFs, the presence of <strong>either</strong> 
  of these discount arrangements is particularly suspect under the anti-kickback 
  statute.</u> Other indicators of suspect discounts include (i) discounts on 
  PPS-covered business that are coupled with exclusive supplier agreements and 
  (ii) discounts on Medicare PPS or other capitated or prospective payment business 
  made in conjunction with explicit or implicit agreements to refer other facility 
  business to the supplier, including Part B or other Federal health care program 
  business. 
<p>Based on the limited facts presented here, we are unable to exclude the possibility 
  that Ambulance Company X may be offering improper discounts to the Nursing Home 
  and other SNFs for their PPS-covered Part A business<strong> </strong>with the 
  intent to induce referrals of more lucrative Part B business. Nor are we able 
  to exclude the possibility that the Nursing Home or other SNFs may be soliciting 
  improper discounts on business for which they bear risk in exchange for referrals 
  of business for which they bear no risk. Indeed, the Arrangement poses a significant 
  risk of such improper "swapping" of business, especially in light of Ambulance 
  Company X's representation that many of its competitors are agreeing to such 
  discounts. These competitor discount arrangements may similarly run afoul of 
  the anti-kickback statute. The risk of improper "swapping" is compounded by 
  the likelihood that SNFs will refer non-PPS business to their contracted PPS 
  provider, both as a matter of practical convenience and because SNF personnel 
  may not always know which patients or transports will be covered by PPS when 
  the services are ordered. In these latter circumstances, the simplest way for 
  a SNF to ensure that it is using its contracted provider for its PPS patients 
  -- and therefore securing the Part A discounts -- is for the SNF to refer most 
  patients to that provider. 
<p>Price reductions offered to SNFs that are not offered to Medicare or Medicaid 
  patients residing in the same facility raise additional issues under section 
  1128(b)(6)(A) of the Act, which provides for permissive exclusion from the Federal 
  health care programs of individuals or entities that submit or cause to be submitted 
  bills or requests for payment (based on charges or costs) under Medicare or 
  Medicaid that are substantially in excess of such individual's or entity's usual 
  charges or costs, unless the Secretary finds good cause for such bills or requests. 
  In determining an individual's or entity's "usual" charges, we will look at 
  the amounts charged to non-Federal payers, including SNFs. If the charge to 
  Medicare substantially exceeds the amount the supplier most frequently expects 
  to receive from non-Federal payers, the supplier may be subject to exclusion 
  under section 1128(b)(6)(A) of the Act. 
<p>The limited information submitted by Ambulance Company X is insufficient to 
  make a determination whether the Arrangement may run afoul of section 1128(b)(6)(A). 
  However, Ambulance Company X estimates that its costs for services under Medicare 
  Part B are approximately 11% higher than its costs for services under Part A 
  PPS. Yet Ambulance Company X intends to charge SNFs as much as 50% less than 
  it charges Medicare for Part B services. At the very least, these facts give 
  rise to an inference that Ambulance Company X might be charging Medicare amounts 
  substantially in excess of its usual charges. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>Based on the facts certified in the request for an advisory opinion and supplemental 
  submissions, we conclude that the Arrangement -- like many similar arrangements 
  with PPS SNFs -- might constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals of Federal health care program 
  business were present and might be subject to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(6) and (7), 1128A(a)(7), or 1128B(b) of 
  the Act.

<p>1. Medicare Part A covers up to 100 days of post-hospital SNF charges. <u>See</u> 
  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395d. In addition, Medicare Part B, the supplementary benefit, 
  covers certain ancillary services provided to SNF patients, both during a covered 
  Part A stay and afterwards. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. <u>See</u> Section 4432 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. Law 105-33. 
  The PPS system for SNFs is being implemented for cost reporting periods beginning 
  after July 1, 1998. There is a transition phase during the first three cost 
  reporting years, during which SNFs will receive a blend of a new Federal case 
  mix adjusted rate and a facility specific rate based on the facility's allowable 
  costs for SNF services for the fiscal 1995 cost reporting period. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. Section 4432(b) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the Social Security 
  Act to establish a requirement for SNF consolidated billing, effective for items 
  and services furnished on or after July 1, 1998. The SNF consolidated billing 
  is a comprehensive billing requirement pursuant to which the SNF itself is responsible 
  for billing Medicare for virtually all of the services that its residents receive. 
  <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 26294 (May 12, 1998). Full implementation of SNF consolidated 
  billing has been postponed indefinitely. <u>See</u> HCFA Program Memorandum 
  Transmittal no. AB-98-35.60 (July 1998). <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 26252 (May 12, 1998). <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. The following types of ambulance services are expressly excluded from the 
  PPS payment by regulation: ambulance trips that initially convey an individual 
  to the SNF to be admitted as a resident; trips that convey the individual to 
  a hospital to be admitted as an inpatient; trips that convey an individual in 
  connection with the receipt of services from a Medicare-participating home health 
  agency under a plan of care; trips that convey an individual to a hospital in 
  connection with the receipt of outpatient services that are not furnished pursuant 
  to the individual's comprehensive care plan; and trips that convey an individual 
  from a SNF after formal discharge, unless the individual is readmitted or returns 
  within a specified period of time. <u>Id.</u> These excluded services constitute 
  a significant part of the ambulance services provided to SNF patients. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. Room and board for these patients is typically covered by Medicaid or through 
  private funds or insurance. <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. <u>See</u> Section 4531 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. Law 105-33. 
  <a name="N_8_"></a> 
<p>8. Chair car services will be provided at the applicable State Medicaid rates. 
  Chair car services are not covered by Medicare. <a name="N_9_"></a> 
<p>9. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for the purposes of this advisory opinion is the same 
  under both. <a name="N_10_"></a> 
<p>10. This is particularly problematic when the contracting payor is a PPS SNF, 
  because Medicare Part B payments essentially may subsidize Part A PPS payments 
  that the government has determined are appropriate and adequate to cover the 
  SNF's costs. <a name="N_11_"></a> 
<p>11. We note that the Agreement contains statements to the effect that remuneration 
  provided under the Agreement is not intended to induce referrals of other business. 
  We find these statements self-serving and not persuasive. <a name="N_12_"></a> 
<p>12. In this regard, we do not think it sufficient to consider only a supplier's 
  marginal costs. Rather, in determining whether a discount is below cost, we 
  look, for example, at the total of all costs divided by the total number of 
  ambulance trips. <p>
