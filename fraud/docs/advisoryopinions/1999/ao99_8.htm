<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-8</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>Dear [name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  Company A's arrangements with Company B, to facilitate a program of professional 
  training for Company B's shoe sales associates and to arrange for personal appearances 
  by podiatrists at Company B's shoe departments (collectively, the "Arrangement"). 
  Specifically, you have inquired whether the Arrangement constitutes grounds 
  for sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social 
  Security Act (the "Act"), in the circumstances presented. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Arrangement would potentially 
  generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on the totality of 
  the facts and the safeguards present in the Arrangement, the Office of Inspector 
  General ("OIG") will not subject Company A to sanctions for violations of the 
  anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act in connection with the Arrangement, as described and certified in your request 
  letter and supplemental submissions. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Company A, the 
  requester of this opinion, and is further qualified as set out in Part V below 
  and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> 
<p>Company A ("Company A") is a State D corporation engaged in the business of 
  professional training and publishing. Company A is a wholly-owned subsidiary 
  of Company C, another State D corporation. Company A is not related to any other 
  party to, or participant in, the Arrangement. 
<p>Company B, ("Company B") is a major discount retailer and retailer of shoes. 
  [Further identifying information redacted.] 
<p><strong>B. The Arrangement</strong> 
<p>The Arrangement consists of two parts, each more fully described below. The 
  first part, the "X Program", is a professional training program for Company 
  B's shoe sales managers and associates. The second part, the "Y Network", is 
  a program related to the X Program through which Company A assembles a network 
  of podiatrists across the country to make scheduled appearances at Company B's 
  shoe departments to advise and consult with Company B's customers and shoe sales 
  associates. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong> 1. The X Program</strong> 
<p>In May 1997, Company A entered into a pilot agreement (the "Initial Agreement") 
  with Company B to test the X Program in selected stores. Under the Initial Agreement, 
  Company A agreed, among other things, to do the following: 
<ul>
  <li>License the trademark "X" to Company B on an exclusive basis.</li>
  <li>Develop "learning criteria" for shoe sales managers and associates in the 
    areas of human anatomy of the foot and shoe design function.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Create computer-based training modules for Company B's shoe sales managers 
    and associates and develop achievement tests for persons who complete the 
    training.</li>
  <li>Design lapel pins and certificates of merit to be manufactured or purchased 
    by Company B and distributed to successfully trained employees.</li>
  <li>Arrange for certification of the training program by a nationally recognized 
    podiatric organization.</li>
  <li>Design in-store posters to promote the program to customers and employees, 
    to be printed, distributed, and placed by Company B.</li>
</ul>
<p>For its part, Company B agreed to pay Company A certain fees for its services 
  based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks in the development of the X 
  Program and the number of stores participating. In addition, Company B committed 
  to support the program through public relations and in-store awareness campaigns 
  for both its employees and customers. 
<p>According to materials submitted by Company A, Company B anticipated that the 
  X Program would better train shoe department sales associates, reduce sales 
  associate turnover rates through greater employee job satisfaction, improve 
  customer service, build consumer confidence, create consumer awareness, familiarize 
  participating podiatrists with Company B's shoes, and ultimately increase shoe 
  sales and profits. 
<p>The pilot program proved successful, with improved retention of shoe department 
  sales associates and positive customer feedback. In July 1998, Company B and 
  Company A entered into a second agreement (the "Implementing Agreement") to 
  continue and expand the X Program at Company B stores on an exclusive basis 
  for two years. In addition to its existing obligations under the Initial Agreement, 
  Company A agreed to assist Company B with periodic upgrades of its computer 
  training modules and, with Company B's "reasonable assistance", to create a 
  "referral service" of podiatrists located near the participating Company B stores 
  (the Y Network, described below).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>Under the Implementing Agreement, Company B agreed to pay Company A an exclusive 
  licensing fee of $[redacted] per year and a program fee of $[redacted] per year, 
  subject to certain adjustments tied to reductions in turnover of sales associates. 
  Company A has represented that all fees paid, or to be paid, by Company B under 
  the Initial and Implementing Agreements represent fair market value for the 
  services rendered or to be rendered by Company A.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p><strong> 2. The Y Network</strong> 
<p>The Y Network ("Y Network") is a program designed to create a pool of participating 
  podiatrists to make scheduled appearances in Company B's shoe departments, as 
  contemplated in the Implementing Agreement for the X Program. Participating 
  podiatrists enter into one-year agreements with Company A pursuant to which 
  they agree to provide one four-hour appearance each month at an assigned Company 
  B location.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> The monthly in-store appearances 
  are publicized by a plaque or posters in the store identifying the podiatrist 
  and the date and time of his or her next appearance. In addition to the monthly 
  in-store appearances, the podiatrist may participate from time to time in special 
  events, including product knowledge demonstrations. During the scheduled appearances, 
  the podiatrist answers questions from Company B's customers and employees regarding 
  foot care and foot problems and conducts brief "foot screenings" in conjunction 
  with answering questions.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> As an additional 
  service, some podiatrists provide free blood pressure screenings to Company 
  B's customers.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
<p>If a customer or employee asks a podiatrist about his or her private practice, 
  the podiatrist is required to provide a written notice with explicit statements 
  that Company B does not endorse the services of any individual participating 
  podiatrist; that the podiatrist has an active license in good standing and has 
  paid to participate in the Y Network; and that Company B's customers and employees 
  are free to choose any provider of podiatric services. Participating podiatrists 
  are not permitted to make on-the-spot appointments for their private practices, 
  nor write prescriptions while on Company B's premises. 
<p>Podiatrists are not compensated for the in-store appearances. Materials marketing 
  the Y Network to podiatrists promise the podiatrists high visibility, exposure 
  to a large volume of customers, and the opportunity to be the exclusive, local 
  foot care specialist at their Company B stores. 
<p>To participate in the Y Network, a podiatrist pays Company A a fixed annual 
  fee, regardless of the size or volume of business of the store to which he or 
  she is assigned.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Company A has certified that 
  this fee represents fair market value for the costs of operating the Y Network, 
  including the costs of enrolling podiatrists, credentialing them, and assigning 
  them to particular stores. To enroll as a Y Network podiatrist, a podiatrist 
  must have an active license in good standing to practice podiatric medicine 
  in the state in which the podiatrist practices and he or she must maintain professional 
  malpractice insurance. Pursuant to the Implementing Agreement, Company B retained 
  the right to disapprove any participating podiatrist for any lawful reason. 
  The Implementing Agreement also provides that participating podiatrists must 
  comply with written standards of conduct promulgated by Company B. In addition, 
  podiatrists must also comply with the standards of conduct of the relevant state 
  podiatric boards. 
<p>Podiatrists are assigned to Company B stores on a "first-come, first-served" 
  basis. A second podiatrist may be assigned to a particular Company B store only 
  with the consent of the first assigned podiatrist. Company A maintains a waiting 
  list of podiatrists for whom there is currently no store available. Groups of 
  podiatrists may share Company B locations for convenience, to spread the cost 
  of the Y Network fee among several practitioners, and to ensure that a podiatrist 
  is always available for the required in-store appearances. 
<p>In sum, the Arrangement consists of conjoined programs -- the X Program and 
  the Y Network -- through which Company A provides Company B with professional 
  training and in-store podiatrists and provides participating podiatrists with 
  access to Company B's customers. 
<p><strong>C. Federal Health Care Program Reimbursement</strong> 
<p>Some professional services provided by the podiatrists in their private practices 
  are potentially reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid, or other Federal health 
  care programs.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> Additionally, some orthotics 
  and other podiatric supplies and devices, as well as some drugs prescribed by 
  podiatrists, may be available through Company B's pharmacy operations and may 
  be reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other Federal health care program. 
  Company A has certified that none of the services the podiatrists perform while 
  at the Company B stores is reimbursable by any Federal health care program, 
  and the podiatrists will not bill any Federal program for such services. Company 
  A has further certified that neither Company B's pharmacies nor its pharmacy 
  employees, contractors, vendors, or suppliers will promote, or participate in, 
  the Arrangement and that there will be no direct or indirect connection between 
  the Arrangement and Company B's pharmacy operations. Company A has also certified 
  that none of the shoes or shoe products sold in the shoe departments of Company 
  B's retail stores are reimbursable under any Federal health care program. 
<p><strong>II. LAW</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: <br>
  <br>
<p>"Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] any 
  remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony." 
<p><u>Id</u>. Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated safe harbor regulations 
  that define practices that are not subject to the anti-kickback statute because 
  such practices would be unlikely to result in fraud or abuse. <u>See</u> 42 
  C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, 
  if met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the 
  arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection 
  is afforded only to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions 
  set forth in the safe harbor. The regulatory safe harbors potentially applicable 
  to the Arrangement are the personal services and management contracts safe harbor, 
  42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d), and the referral services safe harbor, 42 C.F.R. 
  &#167; 1001.952(f). In relevant part for purposes of this advisory opinion, 
  the personal services safe harbor requires that the compensation paid for services 
  be set at fair market value in an arms-length transaction, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 
  1001.952(d)(5); the referral services safe harbor requires that the referral 
  service be open to anyone who meets the qualifications for participation and 
  that payments made by participants be based only on the costs of operating the 
  referral service, 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1001.952(f)(1) &amp; (2). 
<p><strong>III. ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The threshold inquiry under the anti-kickback statute is whether the Arrangement 
  involves any transfer of remuneration to a person or entity who refers Federal 
  health care program business or arranges for or recommends the purchase, lease, 
  or ordering of items or services reimbursable by a Federal health care program. 
  Company A claims that the promotional activities contemplated under the Arrangement 
  do not involve "arranging for or recommending" within the meaning of the statute, 
  and that, in any event, no economic benefit flows from the podiatrists to Company 
  B for any referrals as a result of the interposition of Company A as an unrelated 
  third-party intermediary. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree. 
<p>The promotional activities conducted by Company A and Company B come within 
  the plain language of the statute, which prohibits payments to a person to "arrange 
  for or recommend" the purchasing or ordering of a good or service payable by 
  a Federal health care program. Not only are Company A and Company B providing 
  in-store posters and "awareness" campaigns, they are also orchestrating an opportunity 
  for the podiatrists to market their services personally -- and exclusively -- 
  to potential patients. The in-store signs, special promotions, and authorized 
  presence of the podiatrists in Company B's shoe departments, coupled with Company 
  B's retained right to disapprove any participating podiatrist, amount to an 
  implied recommendation of the podiatrists by Company B, notwithstanding the 
  written disclaimers the podiatrists are required to distribute to customers. 
  Some of those customers will be Federal health care program beneficiaries, and 
  some of the services subsequently provided by the podiatrists to those customers 
  in the podiatrists' private practice may be reimbursable under a Federal health 
  care program. 
<p>Having established an implied recommendation, we also think that both Company 
  A and Company B receive an economic benefit (or "remuneration") in exchange 
  for these promotional activities, since the podiatrists receive no monetary 
  compensation for their in-store appearances each month.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
  These free services benefit both Company A, which otherwise has a contractual 
  obligation to Company B to provide the podiatrists, and Company B, which desires 
  the podiatrists' monthly in-store appearances for its own purposes. The OIG's 
  position on the provision of free or below market value goods or services to 
  potential referral sources is longstanding and clear: the provision of free 
  goods or services to an actual or potential referral source may violate the 
  anti-kickback statute, depending on the circumstances. For example, the preamble 
  to the 1991 safe harbor regulations explains that giving free goods that have 
  an independent value to a physician may violate the anti-kickback statute. <u>See</u> 
  56 Fed. Reg. 35978 (July 29, 1991); <u>see also</u> Special Fraud Alert, 59 
  Fed. Reg. 65372, 65377 (Dec. 19, 1994); OIG Advisory Opinion 98-16. This analysis 
  generally applies to the provision of any free or below market value goods or 
  services to actual or potential referral sources. If the requisite intent to 
  induce or reward referrals of Federal health care program business is present, 
  the anti-kickback statute is violated. 
<p>The interposition of Company A as an intermediary between Company B and the 
  podiatrists does not vitiate our anti-kickback concerns. Through its contractual 
  arrangements with Company B and the participating podiatrists, Company A is 
  in a position to channel "recommendations" from Company B to the podiatrists 
  and "remuneration" from the podiatrists to Company B. Moreover, in some circumstances 
  this type of arrangement could pose a risk that the intermediary would be buying 
  one party's recommendations and reselling them to another party. For example, 
  Company A could accomplish this result if it were to "purchase" Company B's 
  recommendations by selling its X Program services to Company B for less than 
  fair market value (i.e., giving "remuneration") and then "sell" the recommendations 
  to the participating podiatrists by providing its Y Network services at more 
  than fair market value (i.e., receiving "remuneration"). However, as noted above, 
  Company A has certified that its fees from both Company B and the podiatrists 
  are at fair market value. 
<p>Neither of the potentially applicable safe harbors protects the Arrangement. 
  The personal services contracts safe harbor does not apply, because the podiatrists 
  are not compensated for the free services they render, apart from the opportunity 
  to generate business. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952(d)(5). The referral 
  services safe harbor is also inapplicable, because the exclusive location feature 
  of the Y Network excludes some podiatrists from participating and because Company 
  A intends to operate the Y Network at a profit. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 
  1001.952(f)(1) &amp; (2). 
<p>In these circumstances, we conclude that the Arrangement potentially violates 
  the anti-kickback statute insofar as the podiatrists may be giving something 
  of value to Company B and Company A in exchange for promotional activities that 
  rise to the level of "arranging for or recommending" within the meaning of the 
  statute. 
<p>Notwithstanding, in the particular factual circumstances presented and based 
  on the totality of the following factors, we conclude that for purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute the Arrangement poses a low risk of fraud and abuse and 
  contains safeguards that further reduce that risk for the reasons set forth 
  below. <br>
  <br>
<p>The risk of program or patient abuse from the Arrangement is relatively low, 
  since Company B and Company A have a limited ability to influence a significant 
  flow of Federal health care program business to the podiatrists. In evaluating 
  the risks posed by arrangements involving direct or indirect promotional or 
  marketing activity involving potential patients, like Company B's constructive 
  endorsement of the participating podiatrists, we look to a number of factors, 
  including, but not limited to, the following: 
<ul>
  <li><strong>The identity of the party engaged in the marketing or promotional 
    activity and the party's relationship with its audience</strong>. For example, 
    relevant inquiries may include whether the party is involved in the delivery 
    of health care (e.g., a doctor, a nurse, a home health aide, or the like) 
    and whether the party is otherwise in a position to exert undue influence 
    on potential purchasers or patients.</li>
  <li><strong>The nature of the marketing or promotional activity</strong>. One 
    relevant factor is whether and to what degree the activity may be coercive, 
    or perceived to be coercive, by the party to whom the activity is directed. 
    For example, door-to-door marketing, telephone solicitations, and direct mailings 
    are more intrusive, and typically pose a greater potential for abuse, than 
    truthful passive advertising in general circulation newspapers or on television. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>The item or service being promoted or marketed</strong>. Pertinent 
    here, for example, is whether the marketing or promotion identifies specific 
    items or services or whether it consists of more general descriptions of providers 
    or suppliers (e.g., "image" advertising). Another consideration is whether 
    the item or service marketed or promoted is one for which there is a likelihood 
    of overutilization based on the historical experience of the Federal health 
    care programs, reimbursement methodology, or other reason.</li>
  <li><strong>The target audience</strong>. Relevant aspects include whether the 
    activity is specifically directed at senior citizens, Medicaid beneficiaries, 
    or other particularly vulnerable populations. The more focused the marketing 
    or promotional activity is on persons likely to be Federal health care program 
    beneficiaries, the greater the risk to the Federal health care programs and 
    their beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>We emphasize that these factors are not indicative or necessarily probative 
  of whether a practice, in fact, actually violates the anti-kickback statute. 
  Rather, we weigh these factors, as well as other relevant concerns, in assessing 
  the level of risk presented by promotional and marketing activity. These factors 
  are not exclusive and the presence or absence of any one factor is not determinative 
  of whether, in our discretion, we would subject parties engaged in marketing 
  or promotional activity to sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>In the instant case, consideration of these factors, coupled with the safeguards 
  described below, suggests that the risk posed by the Arrangement is low. Neither 
  Company B's shoe departments<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> nor Company 
  A is involved in the delivery of health care. Company B's shoe departments sell 
  no products and provide no services reimbursable by any Federal health care 
  program. Neither Company B, a diversified discount retailer serving a broad 
  spectrum of the general public, nor Company A, a professional training and publishing 
  company, has any special health care relationship with Company B's shoe department 
  customers.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> While participating podiatrists 
  may benefit from the halo effect attributable to their association with Company 
  B, the Arrangement involves no explicit arranging for or recommending of any 
  good, facility, service, or item payable by a Federal health care program by 
  either Company B or Company A. No specific podiatric services are promoted or 
  marketed. Finally, while it involves direct patient contact, the Arrangement 
  is not targeted at Federal health care program beneficiaries, and neither Company 
  B nor Company A has control over the prospective patient mix of the shoe department 
  customers. 
<p>Three safeguards provide additional protection against fraud and abuse. <u>First</u>, 
  the fees paid by the podiatrists to Company A do not vary based on the actual 
  or anticipated volume or value of referrals. Podiatrists each pay the same fixed 
  fee regardless of the size or volume of business of the stores to which they 
  are assigned. After an initial six-month trial period, podiatrists must commit 
  to a second six-month term and then to one-year terms thereafter, during which 
  terms they are obligated to provide in-store appearances, even if no referrals 
  result. 
<p><u>Second</u>, the podiatrists provide Company B's customers and employees 
  who inquire about their private practices with written disclosures indicating 
  that Company B does not endorse the in-store podiatrist and informing them of 
  their freedom of choice. While we do not believe that such disclosures offer 
  sufficient protection from program abuse, effective and meaningful disclosure 
  offers some protection against possible abuses of patient trust. 
<p><u>Third</u>, the risk of cross-referrals to Company B's pharmacy is minimal. 
  Neither Company B's pharmacies nor its pharmacy employees, contractors, vendors, 
  or suppliers will promote, or participate in, the Arrangement, and there will 
  be no direct or indirect connection between the Arrangement and Company B's 
  pharmacy operations. The participating podiatrists are barred from writing prescriptions 
  while on Company B's premises. 
<p>As indicated above, our determination not to impose sanctions in these circumstances 
  is attributable to the entirety of the facts of the Arrangement, including, 
  but not limited to, the identities of the parties and the level of promotional 
  activities. We would likely reach a different conclusion if the Arrangement 
  involved a different setting or different parties, for example, if the participating 
  podiatrists were providing free services (whether directly or facilitated by 
  an intermediary) to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, senior centers, 
  community clinics, physicians' offices, hospitals, home health agencies, or 
  other more traditional sources of referrals of Federal health care business 
  or places where Federal health care program beneficiaries typically seek health 
  care or personal care services. Likewise, we would find suspect a similar arrangement 
  involving Company B's pharmacy departments and physician in-store appearances 
  or one involving an express Company B endorsement of a health care provider. 
<p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that the Arrangement would potentially 
  generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, if the requisite 
  intent to induce referrals were present, but that, based on the totality of 
  the facts and the safeguards present in the Arrangement, the OIG will not subject 
  Company A to sanctions for violations of the anti-kickback statute pursuant 
  to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Arrangement, 
  as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions.

<p><strong>FOOTNOTES:</strong> 
<p>1. The concept of a podiatrist "referral service" first appeared in the Initial 
  Agreement, but no such referral service was created pursuant to that agreement. 
  <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. We are precluded by statute from opining on whether fair market value shall 
  be or was paid for goods, services, or property. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 
  1320a-7d(b)(3)(A). For purposes of this advisory opinion, we rely on the requesting 
  party's certification of fair market value. If the fees paid are not fair market 
  value, this opinion is without force and effect. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. When first entering the Y Network, podiatrists enroll for an initial six 
  month trial period, followed by an additional six month period. The trial period 
  allows the podiatrists to test the program and permits Company A to comply with 
  certain franchising regulations. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. According to Company A, a "foot screening" is understood by the podiatric 
  medical community as a brief look at the feet, not an examination to evaluate 
  a patient's need for medical treatment. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. Company A has certified that these blood pressure screenings are the only 
  additional services provided by the podiatrists. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. Podiatrists pay $[redacted] for an initial six month trial period. For purposes 
  of this advisory opinion, we rely on Company A's certification that the fees 
  charged to podiatrists represent fair market value for services provided. If 
  the fees paid are not fair market value, this opinion is without force and effect. 
  <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. Routine foot care services are generally excluded from coverage under Part 
  A and Part B of Medicare, as are most orthopedic shoes and other supportive 
  devices. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1395y(a)(8) &amp; (13). <a name="N_8_"></a> 
<p>8. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. <a name="N_9_"></a> 
<p>9. In addition, Company A collects fees from the podiatrists to participate 
  in the Y Network. Company A has certified that these fees are fair market value 
  for services rendered by Company A. However, this certification does not account 
  for the value of the podiatrists' free services. <a name="N_10_"></a> 
<p>10. Company B's pharmacy operations are specifically excluded from any involvement 
  in the Arrangement. <a name="N_11_"></a> 
<p>11. Unless, of course, the shoe department customers are also customers of 
  the pharmacy or other department selling health care or personal care items 
  or services. <p>
