<p>OIG Advisory Opinion 99-1 <br>
  <br>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion regarding 
  an arrangement for the provision of back-up emergency ambulance services that 
  involves waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (the "Arrangement"). You 
  have asked whether the Arrangement constitutes prohibited remuneration within 
  the meaning of the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security 
  Act (the "Act"). 
<p>You have certified that all of the information provided in the request, including 
  all supplementary letters, is true and correct and constitutes a complete description 
  of the relevant facts and agreements among the parties. 
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Arrangement could potentially violate the anti-kickback statute if 
  the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the Office of 
  Inspector General ("OIG") will not subject the Arrangement, as described in 
  the request letter and supplemental submissions, to sanctions arising under 
  the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act. 
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the requestor and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p><strong>The State A Emergency Medical Response System &amp; Company X</strong> 
<p>In State A, there are two types of emergency medical response services. The 
  first is basic ambulance service, which involves transportation only ("Emergency 
  BAS").<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> More than seventy-three basic ambulance 
  service providers operate in the service area relevant to the Arrangement (County 
  B and County C). Approximately 95% of these providers are volunteer first aid 
  squads. 
<p>The second type of service is paramedic service, which requires a State A certificate 
  of need. In general, paramedic service providers do not transport patients. 
  Thus, if paramedic services are needed at the scene of an emergency injury or 
  illness, both a paramedic unit and a volunteer first aid squad (or other transport 
  service) are called.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Patients receive paramedic 
  treatment at the scene from the paramedic service and are transported to the 
  hospital by the local volunteer first aid squad, accompanied by paramedics from 
  the paramedic service, if appropriate. <br>
  <br>
<p>Requests for "911" emergency ambulance transportation are received by public 
  safety answering points ("PSAPs"), which determine the appropriate level of 
  ambulance service to send in response. The PSAPs have sole discretion in determining 
  how to direct responses. They are operated by municipal law enforcement agencies 
  supported by city and county taxes. 
<p>Company X ("Company X" or the "Requestor") is a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation 
  owned in equal shares by nine acute care hospitals in Counties B and C, State 
  A. Company X provides various shared services on behalf of its owner-member 
  hospitals, among them basic ambulance and paramedic services. Company X operates 
  a number of paramedic units in its service area.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p>Because Company X is the sole certificate of need holder providing paramedic 
  services within its response area, all requests for paramedic services are referred 
  to Company X. Company X is prohibited, pursuant to its certificate of need, 
  from transporting patients in conjunction with its paramedic services, except 
  in exigent circumstances.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p><strong>The Arrangement</strong> 
<p>Volunteer first aid squads are sometimes unable to respond to Emergency BAS 
  requests in a timely manner. In these circumstances, Company X is willing to 
  provide back-up transportation services. These back-up services are offered 
  on an occasional basis as a community service and are not part of any formal 
  arrangement or agreement between Company X and any PSAP or municipal or county 
  government or agency. Providing the back-up service is not a condition of any 
  contract or referral arrangement, and Company X may decline to provide the back-up 
  service at any time. 
<p>Company X offers back-up Emergency BAS in two circumstances: (1) when Company 
  X responds to a paramedic service request and a volunteer first aid squad fails 
  to arrive at the scene to transport the patient to a hospital ("Emergency BAS 
  incidental to paramedic service"); and (2) when a PSAP receives a "911" request 
  for Emergency BAS, but a volunteer first aid squad is not available to respond 
  ("Back-up Emergency BAS"). Unless the circumstances are exigent, Company X usually 
  waits approximately thirty minutes for a volunteer squad to arrive before transporting 
  a patient to a hospital.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
<p>The volunteer first aid squads in Company X's service area bill neither Federal 
  programs, private payors, nor patients for their services. Thus, typically basic 
  ambulance service to a hospital is provided without cost to insurers and to 
  patients. By contrast, Company X bills for its services in three ways. First, 
  Company X bills insurers when Company X provides paramedic services. These paramedic 
  services are provided under arrangement with hospitals, and, in the case of 
  Medicare, are paid under Part A. Second, when Company X provides Emergency BAS 
  incidental to paramedic ambulance service, the paramedic services are billed, 
  but no payor or patient is billed for the basic ambulance service. Third, when 
  Company X provides Back-up Emergency BAS only (i.e., without any paramedic services), 
  Company X bills insurers, including Medicare, for transportation. Specifically, 
  it bills Medicare Part B under Method 4.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>Company 
  X's charges for its Back-up Emergency BAS do not vary based on the payor. 
<p>It is the third billing situation that gives rise to the Arrangement. Because 
  the patients in Company X's service area do not typically pay fees for basic 
  ambulance service and because collection of such fees would tend to cast the 
  volunteer basic ambulance service system in a poor light, Company X waives patient 
  copayments and deductibles when it provides Back-up Emergency BAS for volunteer 
  first aid squads.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> Company X does not advertise 
  this practice. Except in these circumstances, Company X collects applicable 
  coinsurance whenever it bills an insurer. 
<p>Pursuant to the Arrangement, <a name="redact"></a>Company X waives copayments 
  and deductibles for only a small number of its patients. For the period from 
  August 25, 1997, to August 25, 1998, Company X waived copayments and deductibles 
  for [ ] patients. These [ ] patients constituted [less than one percent] of 
  Company X's total patients and [less than three percent] of its Medicare Part 
  B patients. Company X waived Medicare Part B copayments and deductibles in the 
  amount of 
<p>$[ ], representing [less than one percent] of Company X's $[ ] in total Medicare 
  Part B program payments, including copayments and deductibles. During this period, 
  Company X collected $[ ] in payments from private insurers, including applicable 
  copayments and deductibles. 
<p>The only patients who receive Company X's Back-up Emergency BAS are those who 
  have dialed "911" to request basic ambulance service in an emergency. Routine 
  scheduled transportation services (i.e., home to physician's office, home to 
  diagnostic testing, home to dialysis center, Emergency Department discharge 
  to home, etc.) are not provided under any circumstances as part of the Arrangement. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by the Federal health care programs. Section 1128B(b) 
  of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals of items 
  or services paid for by a Federal health care program, the anti-kickback statute 
  is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes criminal liability to parties 
  on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. For purposes of the 
  anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, 
  in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration is to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9<sup>th</sup> 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 476 U.S. 988 (1985). Violations of the statute constitute a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from the Federal and state health care programs 
  or to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
<p>We have a clear and long-standing concern about potentially abusive waivers 
  of Medicare copayments and deductibles. For example, we have previously stated 
  that providers who routinely waive Medicare copayments or deductibles may be 
  held liable under the anti-kickback statute. <u>See, e.g.</u>, Special Fraud 
  Alert, 59 Fed. Reg. 65374 (Dec. 19, 1994); Advisory Opinion 98-6 (April 20, 
  1998); Advisory Opinion 97-4 (Sept. 25, 1997). One indicator of a potentially 
  prohibited waiver is the failure to collect copayments or deductibles for a 
  specific group of Medicare patients for reasons unrelated to individualized, 
  good faith assessments of financial hardship. 
<p>Waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to Federal health care program 
  beneficiaries may constitute prohibited remuneration to induce self-referrals 
  under the anti-kickback statute. In the circumstances presented here, however, 
  the risk of such prohibited remuneration is minimal. Critical to this determination 
  is a recognition that in areas where Company X provides Back-up Emergency BAS 
  for volunteer first aid squads, there is no expectation on the part of an emergency 
  patient that there will be a charge -- much less a copayment -- for Emergency 
  BAS. In light of that fact, Company X's failure to collect a copayment for the 
  isolated instances in which it provides Back-up Emergency BAS can hardly be 
  described as an inducement to use the service. Moreover, even if Company X were 
  trying to induce referrals, the certificate of need requirements preclude it 
  from expanding its provision of such services substantially. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>Based on the facts certified by Company X, we conclude that, although the Arrangement 
  technically would fall within the prohibition of the anti-kickback statute if 
  the requisite intent were present, we will not seek to impose sanctions under 
  sections 1128(b)(7) (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act for 
  waivers of copayments and deductibles made under the Arrangement. <br>

<p><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong><a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. According to the request for an advisory opinion and supplemental submissions, 
  State A's two types of emergency transportation services are known as basic 
  life support ("BLS") and advanced life support ("ALS"). To avoid confusion with 
  the use of the terms BLS and ALS for purposes of Medicare reimbursement, this 
  advisory opinion uses the terms "basic ambulance service" and "paramedic service" 
  to describe the two State A services. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. In rare circumstances, Emergency BAS may be provided by providers other 
  than volunteer first aid squads. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. As required by state regulation, Company X operates a minimum of 7.5 full 
  time equivalent paramedic units in its service area. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. Company X provides non-Emergency BAS and paramedic services under contractual 
  arrangements not relevant here. This opinion is limited to emergency transport 
  services only. No opinion is expressed with respect to any non-emergency services. 
  <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. Usually Company X provides basic ambulance service only within its service 
  area; however, under exigent circumstances it will receive and respond to requests 
  for basic ambulance service from outside its service area. <a name="N_6_"></a> 
<p>6. Under Method 4, providers bill separate charges for services, mileage, and 
  supplies. <a name="N_7_"></a> 
<p>7. Company X waives copayments and deductibles only in connection with its 
  provision of Back-up Emergency BAS for volunteer first aid squads. Except for 
  waivers of copayments and deductibles in connection with Back-up Emergency BAS 
  for volunteer first aid squads, this opinion is without force and effect for 
  waivers of a Federal health care program coinsurance amount. <a name="N_8_"></a> 
<p>8. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the Arrangement 
  are based on violations of the anti-kickback statute, the analysis for purposes 
  of this advisory opinion is the same for both. <p>
