<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-7</strong> </p>
<p>Dear [name redacted] and [name redacted]: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  the National Eye Care Project (&quot;NECP&quot;) and Dr. A's participation in 
  the NECP. A key component of the NECP involves an insurance only billing policy 
  (i.e., an across-the-board waiver of any out-of-pocket beneficiary copayments) 
  for medical services covered by the NECP. Specifically, you have requested confirmation 
  that this policy does not constitute grounds for the imposition of a sanction 
  under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), 
  which prohibits the offering of inducements to beneficiaries in order to influence 
  their selection of a provider for Medicare or Medicaid covered services. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, the insurance only billing practice (to 
  the extent it results in waivers of coinsurance obligations for eligible Medicare 
  or Medicaid patients referred by the NECP) constitutes prohibited remuneration 
  within the meaning of section 1128A(a)(5). Notwithstanding, for the reasons 
  set forth below and subject to certain conditions described below, in the particular 
  circumstances presented, the OIG will not subject the NECP or Dr. A (as a participating 
  NECP ophthalmologist) to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any person other than the addressees and 
  is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p>The National Eye Care Project is a public outreach program that provides medical 
  eye care for eligible senior citizens. The program began in 1983 and is cosponsored 
  by the Foundation of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (&quot;Foundation&quot;) 
  and the Knights Templar Eye Foundation, Inc. Dr. A is the [title redacted] and 
  is one of the participating ophthalmologists. </p>
<p>The NECP encourages elderly citizens to protect their eyesight by having a 
  comprehensive eye exam and any needed treatment. The Foundation has set up a 
  referral network of ophthalmologists who agree to provide a comprehensive medical 
  eye examination and up to twelve months of follow-up care for any condition 
  diagnosed at the initial visit without any out-of-pocket cost to the NECP patients. 
  The NECP does not cover eyeglasses, prescription drugs, hospital services, or 
  services of other medical professionals.<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Participating ophthalmologists agree to accept insurance reimbursement as payment 
  in full for care rendered to the NECP patients; no copayments or deductibles 
  (collectively referred to as &quot;coinsurance&quot;) are collected from any 
  patient for the treatment of any condition diagnosed at the initial visit. If 
  the treatment continues for more than one year after the initial diagnosis, 
  a participating ophthalmologist may waive the coinsurance only if he or she 
  determines that the patient is in financial need according to an individualized 
  need determination performed by the ophthalmologist. If a patient has no insurance 
  coverage, the participating ophthalmologist will render eye care without charge. 
</p>
<p>The NECP is promoted through public service announcements by the Foundation. 
  Individual ophthalmologists do not refer patients to, or advertise their participation 
  in, the NECP. The advertisements encourage the elderly to call an 800 number 
  maintained by the Foundation, either for free eye care information or for referral 
  to a participating ophthalmologist. A caller to the Foundation's 800 number 
  who wishes to see an ophthalmologist is screened for eligibility. Individuals 
  are eligible if they are U.S. citizens or legal residents, age 65 and older, 
  who have not seen an ophthalmologist in the past three years.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  In most cases, the NECP will only refer a caller once. </p>
<p>Once a person is determined to be eligible, he or she is assigned to a participating 
  ophthalmologist by a computer program that uses zip codes and geographic proximity 
  to match the person with a nearby participating ophthalmologist. Computer assignments 
  are made on a rotating basis; a physician only receives a second patient after 
  all other participating ophthalmologists in that area have been assigned a first 
  patient. In addition, participating ophthalmologists cannot examine or treat 
  more than fifteen new NECP patients in any one calendar year. The only exception 
  to this limit is for participating ophthalmologists practicing in health professional 
  shortage areas or medically underserved areas. Consequently, the number of NECP 
  patients any participating ophthalmologist sees is unlikely to constitute a 
  significant proportion of his or her practice. </p>
<p>The NECP has received national recognition during its sixteen year history, 
  including the President's Citation for Private Sector Initiative in 1986 and 
  1988, the American Medical Association's President's Citation for Service to 
  the Public, the American Association of Retired Persons Award for Public Service, 
  and more than thirty other citations and commendations from government agencies. 
</p>
<p>Prior to the initial implementation of the NECP, the Foundation consulted with 
  the OIG to assure that the program would not violate the anti-kickback statute. 
  In a letter dated October 30, 1984, then Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow 
  approved the NECP as long as: (i) all ophthalmologists are free to participate; 
  (ii) the ophthalmologists who participate are aware of Medicare reimbursement 
  policy for ophthalmological services; (iii) referrals by the project to ophthalmologists 
  are made on a rotating basis; and (iv) the number of beneficiaries for whom 
  coinsurance is waived does not constitute a significant proportion of any one 
  ophthalmologist's practice. The NECP has certified that it is in compliance 
  with these requirements. <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Prior to enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
  of 1996 (&quot;HIPAA&quot;), the NECP requested that participating ophthalmologists 
  waive the coinsurance for eligible patients referred to them by the NECP without 
  performing any financial need determination. However, as of January 1, 1997, 
  when HIPAA took effect, the NECP modified its program to comply with section 
  231(h) of HIPAA, now section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act (described below), and narrowed 
  the focus of its advertising and outreach efforts to target only seniors who 
  would meet financial need criteria. Information sheets were modified to read: 
  &quot;For seniors <u>without the means to pay</u>, the fees for the examination 
  and treatment are waived.&quot; (emphasis added). When potential patients telephone 
  the NECP, operators now perform a financial need analysis before the patients 
  are referred to a participating physician. As a result of this and other factors 
  (such as a decrease in advertising by the NECP), the number of callers dropped 
  from 5,698 in 1996 to 1,913 in 1997. </p>
<p>The NECP has requested an opinion as to whether its former practice of insurance 
  only billing for all patients irrespective of financial need would run afoul 
  of section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act. </p>
<p><strong>II. THE NECP'S WAIVER OF COINSURANCE IMPLICATES THE CIVIL MONETARY 
  PENALTY PROHIBITING INDUCEMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Applicable Law </strong></p>
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act prohibits a person from offering or transferring 
  remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits under Medicare or Medicaid 
  that such person knows or should know is likely to influence such individual 
  to order or receive from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier any 
  item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare 
  or Medicaid. For purposes of this section, &quot;remuneration&quot; is defined 
  as including the waiver of coinsurance amounts, except in certain narrowly defined 
  circumstances, such as copayment waivers that are not advertised, not routine, 
  and made after a good faith financial determination. The definition of remuneration 
  also includes an exception for certain incentives given to individuals to promote 
  the delivery of preventive care. <u>See</u> Section 1128A(i)(6)(D) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>The NECP clearly falls within the activities proscribed by section 1128A(a)(5) 
  of the Act. Congress specifically included waivers of coinsurance in its statutory 
  definition of &quot;remuneration.&quot; However laudatory the goal, the NECP 
  uses the promise of free care to motivate otherwise reluctant patients to undergo 
  eye examination and treatment (if needed). In short, the patient visits the 
  <u>particular</u> ophthalmologist identified by the NECP because the patient 
  is told that the ophthalmologist will waive any out-of-pocket costs associated 
  with the treatment. </p>
<p>The statutory proscription in section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act reflects serious 
  programmatic concerns with waivers of coinsurance. We published a Special Fraud 
  Alert (&quot;Fraud Alert&quot;) in May 1991, which stated that providers who 
  routinely waive Medicare Part B coinsurance may be held liable under the anti-kickback 
  statute. <u>See</u> Special Fraud Alert, <u>reprinted</u> <u>in</u> 59 Fed. 
  Reg. 242 (1994). Although the Fraud Alert pre-dates the passage of section 1128A(a)(5) 
  and therefore addresses only the potential problems under the anti-kickback 
  and false claims statutes, the programmatic concerns are identical. When providers 
  forgive financial obligations for reasons other than genuine financial hardship 
  of the particular patient, they may be inducing the patient to use items or 
  services that are unnecessary, simply because they are free. Thus, except in 
  those special cases specifically excepted from section 1128A(a)(5), Medicare 
  Part B waivers of coinsurance are highly problematic. </p>
<p>However, for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that we will not impose 
  sanctions on the NECP under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in the particular 
  circumstances presented here. We stress that, standing alone, none of the factors 
  below would assure us that the NECP program is not prone to fraud and abuse, 
  nor would we necessarily reach the same conclusion if we were reviewing the 
  NECP for the first time. However, because of the NECP's reliance on prior written 
  approval from the Inspector General, coupled with the unique nature of the program 
  and the safeguards the NECP has put in place, we will not impose sanctions. 
</p>
<p><u>First</u>, our determination is based on our recognition that the NECP program 
  was created nearly fifteen years ago in reliance on explicit approval from this 
  Office. When the NECP was first developed, its counsel consulted the OIG and, 
  on October 30, 1984, then Inspector General Kusserow issued a letter to the 
  NECP that approved the project, as long as (i) all ophthalmologists are free 
  to participate; (ii) the ophthalmologists who participate are aware of Medicare 
  reimbursement policy for ophthalmological services; (iii) referrals by the project 
  to ophthalmologists are made on a rotating basis; and (iv) the number of beneficiaries 
  for whom coinsurance is waived does not constitute a significant proportion 
  of any one ophthalmologist's practice. The NECP has operated its program in 
  reliance on this approval. </p>
<p><u>Second</u>, we are not aware of any documented overutilization by participating 
  ophthalmologists or any other documented abuses associated with the NECP during 
  its fifteen years of operation. While no demonstration of harm is required by 
  section 1128A(a)(5) or many of the other health care fraud and abuse authorities, 
  in this particular instance -- where the NECP sought and received official written 
  approval in advance of operation and has complied with the terms of that approval 
  -- it is reasonable to take the absence of any evidence of abuse into consideration. 
</p>
<p><u>Third</u>, while the NECP is over-inclusive in that the waiver of coinsurance 
  is not limited to the financially needy, the NECP has nevertheless provided 
  a significant benefit to financially needy individuals who may not otherwise 
  have sought or received care. The NECP has been recognized by, and received 
  awards from, the public and private sectors for its benefits to public welfare 
  including recognition by several United States Presidents and the American Medical 
  Association. Congressional recognition of the value of the NECP and of the inadvertent 
  impact of section 1128A(a)(5) on the NECP was a major impetus in the recent 
  amendment specifically confirming the Secretary's discretion under section 1128D(b)(2)(E) 
  of the Act to exempt certain practices that would otherwise be prohibited under 
  section 1128A(a)(5). <u>See</u> Pub. L. No. 105-277 (1998); 144 Cong. Rec. H10243, 
  10253 &amp; 10258 (1998) (&quot;HHS is authorized to issue an advisory opinion 
  permitting waiver of [the coinsurance and deductibles] requirements with regard 
  to [services provided by the NECP].&quot;) (statement of Rep. Stearns). </p>
<p><u>Fourth</u>, at least some parts of the comprehensive eye examination given 
  to the NECP patients on their initial visit constitute preventive care services 
  and would be exempt from the definition of remuneration in any event. <u>See</u> 
  Section 1128A(i)(6)(D) of the Act. </p>
<p><u>Finally</u>, the benefit to any one ophthalmologist is limited. The rotating 
  basis upon which the NECP pairs eligible patients with ophthalmologists greatly 
  reduces the risk that an ophthalmologist participating in the NECP could benefit 
  in any significant way from the NECP referrals, thus minimizing any risk of 
  fraud and abuse. Participating ophthalmologists do not advertise that they participate 
  in the NECP and cannot refer patients to themselves through the NECP. A computer 
  assigns the eligible patients on a rotating basis. Each participating ophthalmologist 
  in a location (defined by zip code and geographic proximity) receives one patient 
  before any other participating ophthalmologist in that area receives a second 
  patient. </p>
<p>Moreover, ophthalmologists cannot examine or treat more than fifteen new NECP 
  patients in any one calendar year.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> The only 
  exceptions to this policy are for ophthalmologists practicing in health professional 
  shortage areas or medically underserved areas. Consequently, the number of NECP 
  patients is not likely to constitute a significant percentage of any participating 
  ophthalmologist's practice. </p>
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>For the above reasons and based on the facts as certified in the request letter 
  and supplemental submissions, we conclude that the insurance only billing practice 
  (to the extent it results in waivers of coinsurance obligations for eligible 
  Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by the NECP) constitutes prohibited remuneration 
  within the meaning of section 1128A(a)(5). Notwithstanding, for the reasons 
  and subject to the conditions set forth above, in the particular circumstances 
  presented, the OIG will not subject the NECP or Dr. A (as a participating NECP 
  ophthalmologist) to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act. </p>
