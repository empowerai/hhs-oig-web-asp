<p><strong>Re: OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-10</strong> </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: </p>
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion concerning 
  a corporate sponsorship program between Drug Company A (&quot;Company A&quot;) 
  and Charity B (&quot;Charity B&quot;) (the &quot;Proposed Arrangement&quot;). 
  Specifically, you have inquired whether the Proposed Arrangement constitutes 
  grounds for sanctions under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the 
  Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), or under the civil monetary penalty 
  provision for inducements to beneficiaries, section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act, 
  in the circumstances presented. </p>
<p>In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and information 
  presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such 
  information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts 
  have not been disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without 
  force and effect. </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that (i) the Proposed Arrangement 
  would potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the Office 
  of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) will not subject Company A or Charity 
  B to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 
  1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement, 
  as described and certified in the request letter and supplemental submissions; 
  and (ii) the OIG will not subject Company A or Charity B to sanctions under 
  section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with the Proposed Arrangement. 
</p>
<p>This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than Company A and Charity 
  B, the requesters of this opinion, and it is further qualified as set out in 
  Part VI below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. </p>
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A. The Parties</strong> </p>
<p>Company A is a licensed pharmacy that dispenses respiratory drugs via mail 
  order to patients in State X and other states. Respiratory drugs, and the nebulizers 
  used to inhale them, are provided pursuant to a prescription from a patient's 
  physician. Patients usually obtain the drugs from a pharmacy and the nebulizer 
  from a durable medical equipment (&quot;DME&quot;) supplier. Company A's business 
  typically comes from referrals from physicians and DME suppliers. Many customers 
  are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or other Federal health care program. </p>
<p>Charity B is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in State X formed to conduct 
  educational and public awareness campaigns about lung diseases and the hazards 
  of smoking and to promote activities that lead to healthy lungs. Charity B is 
  a state constituent of the American Lung Association. Charity B does not provide 
  any DME or prescribe any drugs, make any referrals to particular providers of 
  health care services (including pharmacies), or express any preferences regarding 
  any providers. Charity B receives financial support from individuals and corporations. 
  Aggregate annual donations typically fluctuate between $[x] and $[y] million. 
  No shareholders, officers, directors, or employees of Company A serve on Charity 
  B's board of directors or on any other Charity B decision-making body. </p>
<p><strong>B. The Proposed Arrangement</strong> </p>
<p>Company A and Charity B wish to enter into an arrangement pursuant to which 
  Company A will make charitable donations to Charity B, and Charity B will allow 
  Company A to use its name, logo, and other proprietary symbols and phrases (collectively, 
  for purposes of this opinion, &quot;Charity B's marks&quot;) for certain limited 
  promotional activities (the &quot;Proposed Arrangement&quot;). There will be 
  no other business arrangements between Company A and Charity B. Company A will 
  not offer patients rebates or discounts on nebulizer drugs in connection with 
  the Proposed Arrangement. </p>
<p>Under the Proposed Arrangement, Company A would donate a fixed sum to Charity 
  B for each nebulizer drug prescription Company A fills for patients residing 
  in State X. The sum would not exceed ten dollars per prescription shipment. 
  In order to calculate the aggregate donation, Company A would track prescriptions 
  by the state in which the patient resides, but not by referral source or patient 
  name. The Proposed Arrangement would be an exclusive arrangement; neither Company 
  A nor Charity B would enter into a similar arrangement with any other party. 
</p>
<p>Charity B will permit Company A to use Charity B's marks solely in advertising 
  and promotional materials that generally identify, describe, or portray the 
  Proposed Arrangement or Charity B's charitable activities. The thrust of any 
  advertising will be the promotion of Charity B's charitable activities and Company 
  A's financial support of those activities. For example, promotional material 
  may describe Charity B's children's programs and may indicate that Company A 
  is providing financial support for those activities.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  Promotional material under the Proposed Arrangement will not refer to Company 
  A's products or services, and Charity B's marks will not be used in, or in connection 
  with, any advertising for Company A's products or services. Advertisements will 
  not be placed or distributed so as to suggest Charity B's endorsement of any 
  specific Company A product or service (e.g., advertisements about the Proposed 
  Arrangement will not be placed alongside or in the vicinity of Company A product 
  advertisements; brochures about the Proposed Arrangement will not be accompanied 
  by advertisements for specific Company A products or services). </p>
<p>The majority of Company A advertising of the Proposed Arrangement will be placed 
  in regional trade publications directed at DME companies, physicians, respiratory 
  therapists, and other health care professionals who have direct contact with 
  patients using nebulizer drugs. None of these health care professionals will 
  receive any financial incentive to induce referrals as a result of the Proposed 
  Arrangement.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Company A may also send brochures 
  explaining the Proposed Arrangement to its existing patient customers, as well 
  as DME suppliers, physicians, respiratory therapists, and other appropriate 
  health care professionals. Company A will not send brochures or other marketing 
  materials to prospective patient customers. </p>
<p>All advertising or other materials that use Charity B's marks will be subject 
  to Charity B's review and approval. Charity B has represented that it will not 
  permit Company A to use Charity B's marks in any way that would constitute an 
  endorsement of Company A's products or services. Charity B may itself promote 
  the Proposed Arrangement through its newsletter or in a separate letter from 
  Charity B's president to its membership. Neither the newsletter nor the president's 
  letter will describe, recommend, or endorse any particular Company A product 
  or service. </p>
<p>Company A and Charity B have certified that all advertising and promotional 
  activity under the Proposed Arrangement will comply with all applicable Federal 
  and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, compliance with 
  consumer laws prohibiting false advertising, unfair and/or deceptive advertising, 
  and consumer fraud.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Charity B would treat Company A's donations as unrestricted general corporate 
  donations. The proceeds would go into Charity B's general fund to be used at 
  the sole discretion of Charity B's board of directors. Although the funds are 
  unrestricted and may be used as the board sees fit, the parties anticipate that 
  Company A's funds would be used for three Charity B projects that serve children 
  with asthma: a free summer camp with special asthma-related activities, an asthma 
  screening program to identify children at risk for asthma, and a school-based 
  educational program to teach children to manage their asthma. The funding and 
  operation of these programs, including the selection of participating children, 
  is wholly the responsibility of Charity B, without any participation by Company 
  A. Company A is not informed of the identity of program participants. While 
  the scope and intensity of program services will be enhanced by Company A's 
  donations, none of the Charity B programs will be dependent on them. At ten 
  dollars per prescription shipment, Company A estimates that its annual donations 
  to Charity B will be in the range of $[c] to [d], amounting to approximately 
  [less than 9%] of Charity B's total revenue from grants and donations. </p>
<p><strong>C. Federal Reimbursement</strong> </p>
<p>Because they are considered supplies necessary for the proper use of a nebulizer, 
  respiratory drugs are covered by Medicare Part B's DME, prosthetics, orthotics, 
  and supplies (&quot;DMEPOS&quot;) benefit. For covered nebulizer drugs, Medicare 
  pays the dispensing pharmacy 80% of the lesser of (i) the actual charge or (ii) 
  the allowable 95% of the average wholesale price. <u>See</u> sections 1833(a)(1) 
  and 1842(o) of the Act. The beneficiary is responsible for paying the dispensing 
  pharmacy the remaining 20% of the actual charge or 20% of the allowable 95% 
  of the average wholesale price as a Medicare copayment.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  Company A has represented that the Medicare fee schedule is approximately eighty 
  percent of Company A's usual and customary prices for respiratory drugs. Medicaid 
  reimburses nebulizer drugs as a prescription drug benefit in accordance with 
  the upper limits established by the Health Care Financing Administration. <u>See</u> 
  42 C.F.R. §§ 447.331-.334. Company A has certified that it will not seek to 
  pass the costs of its donations through to any Federal health care program or 
  beneficiary. </p>
<p><strong>II. LAW</strong> </p>
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Specifically, the statute provides that: </p>
<p>&quot;Whoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays [or solicits or receives] 
  any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, 
  overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person 
  -- to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the 
  furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part under a Federal health care program, or to purchase, lease, order, or 
  arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, 
  service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal 
  health care program, shall be guilty of a felony.&quot; </p>
<p><u>Id.</u> Thus, where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible &quot;kickback&quot; 
  transaction. For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, &quot;remuneration&quot; 
  includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or 
  indirectly, covertly or overtly. </p>
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>III. THE OIG WILL NOT SUBJECT THE REQUESTERS TO SANCTIONS UNDER SECTION 
  1128B(B) OF THE ACT</strong> </p>
<p>The threshold inquiry under the anti-kickback statute is whether the Proposed 
  Arrangement involves any transfer of remuneration to a potential referral source, 
  that is, to a person or entity that refers Federal health care program business 
  or arranges for or recommends the purchase, lease, or ordering of items or services 
  reimbursable by a Federal health care program. </p>
<p>Payments by a health care entity to a charitable organization -- particularly 
  one with a health care mission -- in exchange for the exclusive use of the charitable 
  organization's name, logo, and other proprietary symbols and phrases for promotional 
  purposes potentially implicate the plain language of the statute. Depending 
  on the circumstances, the use of the name, logo, and other propriety material 
  in promotional materials may amount to an express or implied recommendation 
  by the charitable organization of the entity's products or services. To the 
  extent such products or services are covered by the Federal health care programs, 
  the statute may be implicated. </p>
<p>We have said previously that in evaluating the risks posed by arrangements 
  involving direct or indirect promotional or marketing activity, we look at a 
  number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
<ul>
  <li>The identity of the party engaged in the marketing or promotional activity 
    and the party's relationship with its audience.</li>
  <li>The item or service being promoted or marketed.</li>
  <li>The nature of the marketing or promotional activity.</li>
  <li>The target audience.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These factors are not indicative or necessarily probative of whether a practice, 
  in fact, violates the anti-kickback statute. Rather, we weigh these factors, 
  as well as other relevant concerns, in assessing the level of risk presented 
  by promotional and marketing activity. These factors are not exclusive and the 
  presence or absence of any one factor is not determinative of whether, in our 
  discretion, we would subject parties engaged in marketing or promotional activity 
  to sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute. </p>
<p>In the instant case, consideration of these factors, coupled with other factors 
  described below, suggests that the risk of unlawful kickbacks posed by the Proposed 
  Arrangement is low. </p>
<p>We begin by recognizing that Charity B, like many nonprofit organizations, 
  likely enjoys a high level of public recognition and trust, particularly among 
  those in State X affected by respiratory diseases. Thus, a recommendation or 
  endorsement by Charity B of Company A's products or services would probably 
  carry great weight. However, where, as here, there is no recommendation or endorsement 
  of any Company A product or service, Charity B's ability to influence referrals 
  is more limited. In this regard, Company A and Charity B have certified that: 
<ul>
  <li>Promotional activities will be limited to identifying, describing, or portraying 
    generally the Proposed Arrangement and/or Charity B's charitable activities, 
    without reference to any of Company A's products or services;</li>
  <li>Charity B's marks will not be used in, or in connection with, any Company 
    A product or service advertising; and</li>
  <li>Advertisements will not be placed or distributed in such a way as to suggest 
    Charity B's endorsement of any Company A product or service (e.g., advertisements 
    about the Proposed Arrangement will not be placed alongside or in the vicinity 
    of any Company A product advertisements; customer brochures about the Proposed 
    Arrangement will not be accompanied by advertisements for specific Company 
    A products or services). </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Moreover, the promotional activities primarily involve print advertisements 
  in trade publications aimed, not at prospective patient customers, but at a 
  less vulnerable audience (i.e., health care professionals, such as DME suppliers, 
  physicians, and respiratory therapists). There will be no direct contact with 
  prospective Company A patient customers. Direct contact with existing customers 
  will be limited to brochures generally describing the Proposed Arrangement, 
  without reference to specific Company A products or services. </p>
<p>Other aspects of the arrangement provide additional protection against fraud 
  and abuse. No physician, DME supplier, respiratory therapist, or other health 
  care professional in a position to refer patients to Company A will receive 
  any remuneration under the Proposed Arrangement. Moreover, there is no risk 
  that Company A will pass the costs of its donations on to Medicare through increased 
  billings, as Company A's usual and customary charge is already substantially 
  higher than the Medicare fee schedule.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> Nor 
  will it pass those costs on to Medicaid, which pays under a fee schedule. In 
  addition, Company A has certified that it will not seek to pass the costs of 
  donations on to Federal beneficiaries by charging them in excess of the Federal 
  program allowable amount. </p>
<p>Finally, we recognize that the Proposed Arrangement's fund-raising potential 
  may significantly benefit children with asthma and others affected by respiratory 
  diseases. In addition, the Proposed Arrangement may help Charity B publicize 
  its programs to physicians and others in a position to refer children for Charity 
  B services, while conserving scarce Charity B resources that might otherwise 
  be spent on outreach efforts. Assuming that promotional activity under the Proposed 
  Arrangement is truthful, non-deceptive, and not misleading, we think the Proposed 
  Arrangement will generally benefit the public. </p>
<p>In sum, for the totality of the above reasons, we would not subject Company 
  A or Charity B to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute in connection 
  with the Proposed Arrangement. </p>
<p><strong>IV. THE OIG WILL NOT SUBJECT THE REQUESTERS TO CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES 
  UNDER SECTION 1128A(a)(5) OF THE ACT</strong> </p>
<p>Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act prohibits a person from offering or transferring 
  remuneration to a beneficiary that such person knows or should know is likely 
  to influence the beneficiary to order items or services from a particular provider 
  or supplier for which payment may be made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
</p>
<p>Company A and Charity B are concerned that the Proposed Arrangement may implicate 
  section 1128A(a)(5), insofar as some beneficiaries might believe they stand 
  a better chance of being able to participate in free Charity B programs (which 
  are sometimes oversubscribed) if they purchase Company A's products. Even if 
  this were likely, on the facts presented we do not believe the statute would 
  be implicated. Any connection between participation in a Charity B program and 
  the purchase of Company A's products would be wholly speculative. Thus, for 
  the reasons stated here and above in Section III, the OIG will not subject Company 
  A or Charity B to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection 
  with the Proposed Arrangement. </p>
<p><strong>V. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>Based on the information provided, we conclude that (i) the Proposed Arrangement 
  would potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, 
  if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the OIG will 
  not subject Company A or Charity B to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback 
  statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act in connection 
  with the Proposed Arrangement, as described and certified in the request letter 
  and supplemental submissions; and (ii) the OIG will not subject Company A or 
  Charity B to sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act in connection with 
  the Proposed Arrangement. </p>

</p>
<p>FOTNOTES: </p>
<p>1. A prototype advertisement submitted with the advisory opinion request shows 
  a photograph of children at summer camp with a caption stating that Company 
  A is teaming up with Charity B to help asthmatic children attend Charity B's 
  special summer camp and that a portion of the proceeds from the purchase of 
  nebulizer drugs will be donated to Charity B to support the summer camp. The 
  advertisement incorporates both Company A's and Charity B's logos. A preliminary 
  version of the prototype included an instruction to readers (presumably physicians, 
  DME suppliers, and respiratory therapists) to call Company A at a 1-800 number 
  and &quot;mention this offer.&quot; This element was subsequently deleted. Company 
  A and Charity B have certified that advertisements under the Proposed Arrangement 
  will not include any instructions to contact Company A or any suggestion that 
  readers may receive a benefit if they contact Company A or if they recommend 
  or purchase Company A's products or services. Advertisements may include instructions 
  for contacting Charity B about Charity B's programs. <a name="N_2_"></a></p>
<p>2. The requesters point out that some providers may benefit incidentally and 
  indirectly if their pediatric patients partake of Charity B's asthma-related 
  services supported by Company A and thus become better able to comply with their 
  treatment plans. <a
name="N_3_"></a></p>
<p>3. Endorsements of commercial products by charitable organizations raise significant 
  issues, not addressed here, of consumer and business law. This advisory opinion 
  is limited to consideration of potential implications of the Proposed Arrangement 
  under the anti-kickback statute and the section 1128A(a)(5) prohibition against 
  inducements to beneficiaries. We express no opinion about the legality of the 
  Proposed Arrangement under other laws. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>
<p>4. If the provider does not accept assignment, there is no limiting charge; 
  thus, beneficiaries may be charged amounts in excess of the Medicare allowable 
  amount. Company A has certified that it will not require beneficiaries to pay 
  more than 20% of the Medicare allowable amount. <a name="N_5_"></a></p>
<p>5. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Proposed Arrangement are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. <a name="N_6_"></a></p>
<p>6. <u>See</u> OIG Advisory Opinion 99-8 (July 6, 1999). <a name="N_7_"></a></p>
<p>7. It would be inappropriate for Company A to offset its donations through 
  higher billings to Medicare or other Federal programs. Thus, for example, if 
  Company A's actual charges were lower than the Medicare fee schedule, Company 
  A would be expected to bill Medicare the lower amount, without passing the cost 
  of the donation to Charity B through to Medicare. </p>
