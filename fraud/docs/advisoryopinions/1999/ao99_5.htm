<p>Re: [name redacted] 
<p>Advisory Opinion No. 99-5 
<p>Dear [name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your request for an advisory opinion, in which 
  you ask whether an annual fee imposed by city ordinance on ambulance companies 
  wishing to provide ambulance services in the city (the "Ambulance Fee") constitutes 
  prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of 
  the Social Security Act (the "Act"), and, if so, whether the Ambulance Fee assessment 
  constitutes grounds for the imposition of sanctions under the anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Act, the exclusion authority related to kickbacks, 
  section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, or the civil monetary penalty provision for kickbacks, 
  section 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. 
<p>You have certified that all of the information you provided in your request, 
  including all supplementary information, is true and correct, and constitutes 
  a complete description of the material facts regarding the assessment of the 
  Ambulance Fee. In issuing this opinion, we have relied solely on the facts and 
  information you presented to us. We have not undertaken any independent investigation 
  of such information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material 
  facts have not been disclosed, this opinion is without force and effect. 
<p>Based on the facts certified in your request for an advisory opinion, we conclude 
  that the Ambulance Fee could constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, but that the 
  Office of Inspector General ("OIG") will not subject the Ambulance Fee, as described 
  in the request and supplemental submissions, to sanctions arising under the 
  anti-kickback statute pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the 
  Act. This opinion may not be relied on by any persons other than the addressee 
  and is further qualified as set out in Part IV below and in 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong> 
<p>The requester of this advisory opinion is the City of [name redacted] (the 
  "City"). By city ordinance, the City established the Ambulance Fee ($50,000 
  per year) for ambulance companies wishing to provide ambulance services in the 
  City. The City intends that the collected Ambulance Fees will partially offset 
  the costs of the City's 911 dispatch system. The factual background is as follows. 
<p>In addition to fire fighting, the City's fire department operates the City's 
  emergency "911" dispatch service, as well as its Basic Life Support First Responder 
  service (the "First Responder" service). The 911 system receives and dispatches 
  calls for assistance from police, fire, and emergency medical services ("EMS"). 
  In the event of a medical emergency, the 911 dispatcher will dispatch both a 
  fire department vehicle to provide First Responder service and a City-licensed 
  ambulance company vehicle. In 1998, the 911 dispatch service received 4,886 
  calls, of which 3,232 (approximately 66%) required the dispatching of an ambulance. 
  The costs of providing the fire department's 911 dispatch service and the First 
  Responder service are not reimbursed by any Federal health care program. <br>
  <br>
<p>Until recently, the City was served by one ambulance company. On August 11, 
  1998, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 98-49 (the "Ordinance"). The Ordinance 
  amended the City's existing ambulance regulations to allow the City to enter 
  into ambulance agreements with any ambulance company that pays the requisite 
  fees and meets specified regulatory requirements, such as minimum levels of 
  equipment, staffing and insurance. Under the Ordinance, companies that desire 
  to operate an ambulance in the City must file a sworn application with a non-refundable 
  application fee of $1,000. If the City approves the application, the company 
  may enter into a three-year ambulance agreement with the City and pay the City 
  an annual fee of $50,000. There is no other remuneration from the ambulance 
  company to the City.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>If the new arrangement created by the Ordinance leads to more than one ambulance 
  company operating in the City, then the referral of emergency 911 calls shall 
  rotate among the participating ambulance companies on a weekly basis. Each ambulance 
  company shall be responsible for responding to all emergency 911 calls during 
  the one-week "shift" assigned to it. When each participating ambulance company 
  has served its one-week shift, the rotation shall repeat in the same order. 
  To date, two ambulance companies have paid the $50,000 annual fee to participate 
  in the ambulance arrangement created by the Ordinance. 
<p>The City Council determined $50,000 to be a reasonable amount for the Ambulance 
  Fee after reviewing the cost and scope of the City fire department's involvement 
  in the provision of EMS in the City. This process included the formation of 
  a committee<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (the "Ambulance Committee") to 
  review the proposed ambulance arrangement later adopted by the Ordinance. The 
  Ambulance Committee considered the City's FY 1998 budget, as well as the fact 
  that the majority of calls to which the fire department responded in 1997 involved 
  emergencies requiring both ambulance and First Responder services. 
<p>The City has certified that the cost to the City of its 911 system for dispatching 
  EMS calls is approximately $150,000 per year (including salaries, benefits and 
  overhead).<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> This amount represents the proportion 
  of the total cost of the 911 system attributable to ambulance dispatching services. 
<p>The City Attorney has certified that the Ordinance was duly noticed as required 
  by the State's Open Meetings Act, that the Ordinance and Ambulance Fee fall 
  within the City's authority under the State's Health and Safety Code to regulate 
  EMS, and that the Ordinance's enactment was in accordance with local and state 
  law. 
<p><strong>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</strong> 
<p>The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully 
  to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce referrals of items 
  or services reimbursable by any Federal health care program. <u>See</u> section 
  1128B(b) of the Act. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce referrals 
  of items or services for which payment may be made by a Federal health care 
  program, the anti-kickback statute is violated. By its terms, the statute ascribes 
  criminal liability to parties on both sides of an impermissible "kickback" transaction. 
  For purposes of the anti-kickback statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer 
  of anything of value, in cash or in-kind, directly or indirectly, covertly or 
  overtly. 
<p>The statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> 
  purpose of the remuneration was to obtain money for the referral of services 
  or to induce further referrals. <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105 (9th 
  Cir. 1989); <u>United States v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <u>cert. 
  denied</u>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Violation of the statute constitutes a felony 
  punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. 
  Conviction will also lead to automatic exclusion from Federal health care programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. This Office may also initiate administrative 
  proceedings to exclude persons from Federal and state health care programs or 
  to impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited 
  activities under sections 1128(b)(7) and 1128A(a)(7) of the Act.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>"Pay to play" arrangements, like the proposed arrangement between the ambulance 
  companies and the City enacted by the Ordinance, clearly implicate the anti-kickback 
  statute. The payment of the Ambulance Fee to the City for the opportunity to 
  provide EMS fits squarely within the language of the anti-kickback statute. 
  Depending on the intent of the parties, the proposed arrangement could violate 
  the statute. 
<p>However, for the following reasons and based on the facts certified in your 
  request for an advisory opinion and in subsequent submissions, the OIG will 
  not subject the Ambulance Fee to sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute 
  pursuant to sections 1128(b)(7) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act. <u>First</u>, the 
  Ambulance Fee is only one part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme by the City 
  to provide oversight and fiscal management to the delivery of EMS. The Ambulance 
  Fee was established by a valid governmental entity legally empowered to regulate 
  the provision of EMS in the City. 
<p><u>Second</u>, the Ambulance Fee is reasonably related to the costs of the 
  operation of the City's 911 system attributable to dispatching ambulances. The 
  City has certified that its annual cost of dispatching ambulances is approximately 
  $150,000. So long as the aggregate collected Ambulance Fees do not exceed the 
  City's cost of dispatching ambulances, then the Fee is a reasonable charge to 
  participating ambulance companies. To date, only two ambulance companies have 
  paid Ambulance Fees, the aggregate of which ($102,000<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>) 
  falls far short of the City's cost of dispatching ambulances. 
<p><u>Third</u>, the Ambulance Fee is not tied directly or indirectly to the volume 
  or value of referrals. The amount of the Ambulance Fee is the same regardless 
  of the volume of business that accrues to the ambulance company that pays it. 
  The City's 911 system employs a fixed rotation system for distributing calls. 
  There is no guarantee as to the volume of business that will accrue to any single 
  ambulance company. Indeed, there is no guarantee against a decrease in business 
  volume resulting from an additional ambulance company contracting with the City 
  for a place in the rotation. 
<p><u>Fourth</u>, the Ambulance Fee assessment should not increase the risk of 
  overutilization or costs to Federal health care programs. Neither the number 
  of Federal program beneficiaries requiring emergency transport in the City, 
  nor the treatment these patients will require or receive at a hospital, is related 
  to the existence or use of the Ambulance Fee. In light of the specific circumstances 
  presented, we would not impose sanctions arising under the anti-kickback statute 
  in connection with the Ambulance Fee. 
<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> 
<p>The advisory opinion process is a "means of relating the anti-kickback statute 
  to the particular facts of a specific arrangement." 62 Fed. Reg. 7350, 7351 
  (Feb. 19, 1997). The advisory opinion process permits the OIG to protect specific 
  arrangements that "contain[] limitations, requirements, or controls that give 
  adequate assurance that Federal health care programs cannot be abused." <u>Id.</u> 
  In evaluating an arrangement's potential to lead to fraud or abuse of the Federal 
  health care programs, no one fact or element is necessarily dispositive. We 
  are persuaded that, taken as a whole, the aspects of the Ambulance Fee described 
  above -- including, but not limited to, its reasonable relationship to the costs 
  of the 911 system, its existence within a municipal regulatory scheme and legislative-representative 
  context, and its uniformity across providers -- create sufficient limitations, 
  requirements, or controls so as to give adequate assurance that the Ambulance 
  Fee will not lead to program abuse under the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>Accordingly, we conclude that while the Ambulance Fee might technically violate 
  the anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent to induce referrals were present, 
  the OIG will not impose sanctions on the requesters under sections 1128(b)(7) 
  (as it relates to kickbacks) or 1128A(a)(7) of the Act, based on the facts certified 
  in the requester's request for an advisory opinion. <br>
  <br>

<p>Chief Counsel to the Inspector General <br>
  <br>
<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. The City has certified that ambulance companies operating in the City have 
  restocked medical supplies used by the fire department when assisting the ambulance 
  companies with First Responder services. The Ambulance Fee arrangement is the 
  complete and entire arrangement that is the subject of this advisory opinion. 
  No opinion is expressed with respect to the fire department restocking. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. The Committee was comprised of the City's Mayor, City Manager, City Attorney, 
  Fire Chief, Police Chief, and two City Council members. <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. While the OIG does not make independent assessments of the fair market value 
  of given services (<u>see</u> section 1128D(b)(3) of the Act), we note that 
  the City justified its figure for the cost of its 911 system by delineating 
  the cost of each item of overhead and then apportioning those costs in accordance 
  with the ratio of ambulance calls to total 911 calls. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. Because both the criminal and administrative sanctions related to the anti-kickback 
  implications of the Ambulance Fee are based on violations of the anti-kickback 
  statute, the analysis for purposes of this advisory opinion is the same under 
  both. <a name="N_5_"></a> 
<p>5. This figure includes a $1,000 application fee per ambulance company. <p>
