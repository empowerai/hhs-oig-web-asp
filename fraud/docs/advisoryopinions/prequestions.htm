<h1>Recommended Preliminary Questions and Supplementary Information for Addressing Requests 
for OIG Advisory Opinions In Accordance With Section 1128D of the Social Security 
Act and 42 CFR Part 1008 </h1>

<h2>I. Introduction </h2>

<p>In requesting an advisory opinion from the Office of Inspector General (OIG), 
you must fully and accurately provide the information required by regulations 
set forth at 42 CFR part&nbsp;1008. In addition, you are encouraged, but not 
required, to respond to the suggested questions set forth below, as appropriate 
to the subject matter of your request. Providing the information that corresponds 
to the subject matter of your inquiry for an advisory opinion may expedite the 
processing of your request by the OIG. The Office of Inspector General reserves 
the right to modify or add suggested questions at any time. </p>

<p>For the purposes of the questions listed below, we will refer to the factual 
context of the question as the &quot;arrangement&quot; and use the following 
definitions. We ask that persons requesting an opinion use the same definitions 
in any submission.</p> 

<ul>
<li>&quot;Referral&quot; means referral of a patient or the purchasing, leasing,  ordering (or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering)  of any good, facility, service or item if any portion of that patient's care  or the cost of the good, facility, service or item may be paid in whole or in  part by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other Federal health care program.  </li>
<li>&quot;Fair market value&quot; means the value that would be assigned to the  item or service in question by individuals or entities who have an arms-length  relationship and who have no ability to influence referrals of any health care  business to each other.  </li>
<li>&quot;Federal Health Care Program&quot; means any plan or program that provides  health benefits, whether directly or indirectly, through insurance, or otherwise,  which is funded directly, in whole or in part, by the United States Government  (other than the health insurance program under 5 U.S.C. 89).  </li>
<li>&quot;Party or Parties&quot; are all individuals or entities that will or  may participate in any way with the arrangement, including indirect ownership  interests. This also includes any parties or third-party beneficiaries to contracts,  as well as others affected by the arrangement. Generally, anyone who may pay  or receive remuneration as a result of the arrangement is a party to the arrangement.  </li>
<li>&quot;Remuneration&quot; means anything of value, whether tangible or intangible.  For example, a reduction or discount, like a direct payment, is remuneration.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Subject Areas </h2>
<p>Set forth below are three specific subject areas for which we are providing 
suggested questions to be answered in advisory opinion requests. </p>
