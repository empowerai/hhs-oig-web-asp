<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicians who rent office space to health care suppliers and providers should make sure the
rental amounts reflect fair-market value for the space actually used by the supplier, according to a
special fraud alert issued today by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector
General.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excessive rental payments can be a ruse to disguise kickbacks from the suppliers to physician-landlords for referrals and may violate the federal anti-kickback law, according to the fraud alert.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have received reports that some suppliers whose businesses depend on physician referrals
are paying excessive rent for office space to their physician-landlords to keep referrals flowing,"
Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. "This fraud alert provides clear guidance to suppliers and
physicians about how to structure office space rental agreements that are within the law." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-kickback law prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully receiving or paying
anything of value to influence the referral of federal health care program business, including Medicare
and Medicaid. Violations of the law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines up to
$25,000, administrative civil money penalties up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in
federal health care programs. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kickbacks can distort medical decision-making, cause
overutilization, increase costs and
freeze out competitors who refuse to pay kickbacks for referrals," Brown said. "The quality of patient
care can suffer when physicians order services or recommend supplies based on profit rather than
patients' best medical interests." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questionable features of suspect rental arrangements center on the following three areas: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<strong>Appropriateness of Rental Agreements.</strong>  The threshold inquiry when examining rental
payments is whether payment is appropriate at all.  Payments of "rent" for space that traditionally has
been provided for free or for a nominal charge for the benefit of the physicians' patients, such as
consignment closets for durable-medical equipment, may be disguised kickbacks.  In general, rental
payments for consignment closets in physicians' offices are suspect.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<strong>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>	Rental Amounts.</strong>  Rental amounts should be at fair-market value, be fixed in advance and not
take into account, directly or indirectly, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated
between the parties. Fair-market value rental payments should not exceed the amount paid for
comparable property. Moreover, where a physician rents space, the rate paid by the supplier generally
should not exceed the rate paid by the physicians in the primary lease for their office space.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<strong>Time and Space Considerations.  </strong>Suppliers should only rent premises of a size and for a time
that is reasonable and necessary for a commercially reasonable business purpose.  Rental of space in
excess of the suppliers' needs creates a presumption that the payments may be a pretext for giving
money to physicians for their referrals. In addition, rental amount calculations should prorate rent based
on the amount of space and duration of time the premises are used.  The basis for any proration should
be documented and updated as necessary. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Office of Inspector General strongly recommends that suppliers and physician-landlords
make every effort to comply with the space rental safe harbor to the anti-kickback law. When an
arrangement meets all of the safe-harbor requirements, the arrangement is immune from prosecution
under the anti-kickback law.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are the safe-harbor requirements, all of which must be met: 1) the agreement is
in writing and signed by the parties; 2) the agreement covers all of the premises rented by the parties
for the term of the agreement and specifies the premises covered by the agreement; 3) if the agreement
is intended to provide the lessee with access to the premises for periodic intervals of time rather than
on a full-time basis for the term of the rental agreement, the rental agreement specifies exactly the
schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact rent for such intervals; 4) the term of the
rental agreement is not less than one year; 5) the aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent
with fair-market value in arms-length transactions, and is not determined in a manner that takes into
account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties for
which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a state health care program; and 6)
the aggregate space rented does not exceed what is reasonably necessary to accomplish the
commercially reasonable business purpose of the rental.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrangements for office equipment or personal services of  physicians' office staff can also be
structured to comply with the equipment rental safe harbor and personal services and management
contracts safe harbor. Specific equipment used should be identified and documented and payment
limited to the prorated portion of its use.  Similarly, any services provided should be documented and
payment should be limited to the time actually spent performing such services.
