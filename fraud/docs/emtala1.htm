  to Provide Emergency Services to Managed Care Enrollees</strong></big></p>
<p>A special advisory bulletin issued today by the Department of Health and Human 
  Services' Office of Inspector General and the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA) makes clear that hospitals must not delay required screening and stabilizing 
  emergency treatment for managed care enrollees to obtain prior authorization 
  from managed care plans. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;This guidance makes clear that despite the terms of any managed care agreements 
  among plans, hospitals, doctors and enrollees, federal law requires that a medical 
  screening and stabilizing treatment be provided in an emergency,&quot; Inspector 
  General June Gibbs Brown said. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;Anyone who believes they are experiencing a medical emergency -- regardless 
  of their ability to pay or the kind of insurance they have -- has a right to 
  expect that hospitals and physicians will meet their obligations under federal 
  law to provide a required emergency medical screening and stabilizing care,&quot; 
  HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Under the 1986 patient anti-dumping law, also known as the Emergency Medical 
  Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), all Medicare-participating hospitals with 
  emergency rooms must provide all patients requesting emergency care with an 
  appropriate medical screening to determine if the person has an emergency medical 
  condition. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  If the person has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide 
  stabilizing care within its capabilities. A transfer of an unstable patient 
  to another facility is allowed only when an informed patient requests the transfer 
  or a physician certifies that the medical benefits of the transfer outweigh 
  the risks. Hospitals may not delay providing medical screening or stabilizing 
  care to inquire about a patient's insurance or other payment arrangements. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Office of Inspector General and HCFA issued the special advisory bulletin 
  after receiving inquiries from the medical community for clarification of the 
  law and complaints that some managed care patients have been improperly denied 
  emergency care. The bulletin was first published in draft form in the Dec. 7, 
  1998, <em>Federal Register</em> and had a public comment period. More than 150 
  comments were received. The final special advisory bulletin went on public display 
  today and is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 10, 1999, <em>Federal Register</em>.

  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;We want to provide clear guidance to hospitals and physicians about their 
  obligations to provide emergency care to managed care enrollees,&quot; Inspector 
  General Brown said. &quot;While hospitals may feel caught between the obligations 
  imposed under the law and the expectations of managed care plans, hospitals 
  clearly must follow the law.&quot; <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Violators of the anti-dumping law face significant penalties. Large hospitals 
  and doctors who negligently violate any requirements of the law are subject 
  to a civil money penalty of up to $50,000 for each offense. The penalty for 
  hospitals with fewer than 100 beds is $25,000 per violation. Hospitals also 
  can face termination from the Medicare program, and physicians found responsible 
  for repeated or gross and flagrant violations can be excluded from participation 
  in all federal health care programs. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In recent years, both the Office of Inspector General and HCFA have stepped 
  up enforcement of the patient anti-dumping law, devoting increased resources 
  to the investigation and resolution of alleged violations. In fiscal year 1999, 
  the Office of Inspector General executed 60 settlements and received one default 
  judgment for total recoveries of more than $1.7 million. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The bulletin also recommends the following &quot;best practices&quot; to help 
  hospitals ensure compliance with the law: 
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Prior Authorization Before Screening or Commencing Stabilizing 
    Treatment.</strong> It is not appropriate for a hospital to seek, or direct 
    a patient to seek, authorization to provide screening or stabilizing services 
    from the individual's health plan or insurance company until after the hospital 
    has provided (1) an appropriate medical screening examination to determine 
    the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition, and (2) any further 
    treatment necessary to commence stabilization of an emergency medical condition. 
    The hospital may seek authorization for payment for all services after providing 
    a medical screening examination and once necessary stabilizing treatment is 
    underway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use of Advance Beneficiary Notices (ABNs) and other Financial Responsibility 
    Forms. </strong>A hospital would violate the patient anti-dumping statute 
    if it delayed a medical screening examination or necessary stabilizing treatment 
    to prepare an ABN and obtain a beneficiary signature. It normally is permissible 
    to ask for general registration information prior to performing an appropriate 
    medical screening. In accordance with HCFA guidelines, a hospital may continue 
    to follow reasonable registration processes, including asking whether an individual 
    is insured and, if so, what that insurance is, as long as this inquiry does 
    not delay screening or treatment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Qualified Medical Personnel Must Perform Medical Screening Examinations 
    and Physicians Must Authorize Transfers.</strong> A hospital should ensure 
    that either a physician or other qualified medical personnel provides an appropriate 
    medical screening examination to <u>all</u> individuals seeking emergency 
    care. If the individual has an emergency medical condition and the individual 
    requires a transfer, only a physician, or if a physician is not physically 
    present in the emergency department at the time, a qualified medical person 
    in consultation with a physician, may authorize a transfer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When a Patient Inquires About Financial Liability for Emergency 
    Services.</strong> If a patient inquires about payment obligations for emergency 
    services, such an inquiry should be answered by a staff member who has been 
    well trained to provide information regarding potential financial liability. 
    This staff member should clearly inform the patient that, regardless of the 
    patient's ability to pay, the hospital will provide a medical screening and 
    stabilizing treatment, if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Voluntary Withdrawal.</strong> If a hospital is aware that an individual 
    intends to leave prior to the screening examination, a hospital should take 
    the following steps: (1) offer the individual further medical examination 
    and treatment within the staff and facilities available at the hospital as 
    may be required to identify and stabilize an emergency medical condition; 
    (2) inform the individual of the benefits of such examination and treatment 
    and of the risks of withdrawal prior to receiving such examination and treatment; 
    and (3) take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed 
    consent to refuse such examination and treatment.</li>
</ul>
