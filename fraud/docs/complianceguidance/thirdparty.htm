<p align="center"><strong>I.  INTRODUCTION</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
continues in its efforts to promote voluntarily developed and implemented compliance programs
for the health care industry.  The following compliance program guidance is intended to assist
third-party medical billing companies (hereinafter referred to as "billing companies")<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and their
agents and subcontractors in developing effective internal controls that promote adherence to
applicable Federal and State law, and the program requirements of Federal, State and private
health plans.

<p>Billing companies are becoming a vital segment of the national health care industry.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
Increasingly, health care providers<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> are relying on billing companies to assist them in processing
claims in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.  Additionally, health care
providers are consulting with billing companies to provide timely and accurate advice regarding
reimbursement matters, as well as overall business decision-making.  As a result, the OIG
considers the compliance guidance for third-party medical billing companies particularly
important in the partnership to defeat health care fraud.

<p>At this juncture, it is important to note the tremendous variation among billing companies in
terms of the type of services<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the manner in which these services are provided to their
respective clients.  For example, some billing companies code the bills for their provider clients,
while others only process bills that have already been coded by the provider.  Some billing
companies offer a spectrum of management services, including accounts receivable management
and bad debt collections, while others offer only one or none of these services.  Clearly,
variations in services give rise to different policies to ensure effective compliance.  This guidance
does not purport to provide instruction on all aspects of compliance.  Rather, we have
concentrated our attention on general Federal health care reimbursement principles.  For those
billing companies that focus their services in a particular sector of the health care industry, the
billing company should also consult any compliance program guidance previously issued by the
OIG for that particular sector.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 

<p>This guidance is pertinent for all billing companies, large or small, regardless of the type of
services provided.  The applicability of the recommendations and guidelines provided in this
document depend on the circumstances of each particular billing company.  However, regardless
of the billing company's size and structure, the OIG believes every billing company can and
should strive to accomplish the objectives and principles underlying all of the compliance
policies and procedures recommended within this guidance.

<p>Within this document, the OIG first provides its general views on the value and fundamental
principles of billing company compliance programs, and then provides specific elements that
each billing company should consider when developing and implementing an effective
compliance program.  Although this document presents basic procedural and structural guidance
for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself a compliance program.  Rather, it is a set of
guidelines for consideration by a billing company interested in implementing a compliance
program.

<p>Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within a billing company
that promotes prevention, detection and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to
Federal and State law, and Federal, State and private payor health care program requirements, as
well as the billing company's ethical and business policies.  In practice, the compliance program
should effectively articulate and demonstrate the organization's commitment to legal and ethical
conduct.  Eventually, a compliance program should become part of the fabric of routine billing
company operations.

<p>Specifically, compliance programs guide a billing company's governing body (<u>e.g.</u>, boards of
directors or trustees), chief executive officer (CEO), managers, billing and coding personnel and
other employees in the efficient management and operation of the company.  They are especially
critical as an internal quality assurance control in reimbursement and payment areas, where
claims and billing operations are often the source of fraud and abuse and, therefore, historically
have been the focus of Government regulation, scrutiny and sanctions.

<p>It is incumbent upon a billing company's corporate officers and managers to provide ethical
leadership to the organization and to assure adequate systems are in place to facilitate and
promote ethical and legal conduct.  Employees, managers and the Government will focus on the
words and actions of a billing company's leadership as a measure of the organization's
commitment to compliance.  Indeed, many billing companies have adopted mission statements
articulating their commitment to high ethical standards.  Compliance programs also provide a
central coordinating mechanism for furnishing and disseminating information and guidance on
applicable Federal and State statutes, regulations and other payor requirements.

<p>The OIG believes that open and frequent communication<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> between the billing company and the
health care provider is fundamental to the success of any compliance endeavor.  The OIG realizes
billing companies are in a unique position with regard to establishing compliance programs.  An
individual billing company may support a variety of providers with different specialities and,
consequently, different risk areas.  It is with this in mind that the OIG strongly recommends the
billing company coordinate with its provider clients to establish compliance responsibilities.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  
Once the responsibilities have been clearly delineated, they should be formalized in the written
contract between the provider and the billing company.  Specifically, the OIG recommends that
the contract enumerate those functions that are shared responsibilities and those that are the sole
responsibility of either the billing company or the provider.

<p>Implementing an effective compliance program requires a substantial commitment of time,
energy and resources by senior management and the billing company's governing body.  
Superficial programs that simply purport to comply with the elements discussed and described in
this guidance or programs hastily constructed and implemented without appropriate ongoing
monitoring will likely be ineffective and could expose the billing company to greater liability
than no program at all.  Additionally, an ineffective compliance program may expose the billing
company's provider clients to liability where those providers have relied on the billing company's
expertise and its assurances of an effective compliance program.  Although it may require
significant additional resources or reallocation of existing resources to implement an effective
compliance program, the long term benefits of implementing the program significantly outweigh
the costs.  Undertaking a voluntary compliance program is a beneficial investment that advances
both the billing company's organization and the stability and solvency of the Medicare program. <a name="_1_2"></a> 

<p><strong>A.  <u>BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</u></strong> 

<p>The OIG believes an effective compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the public
and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse, improving
operational quality, improving the quality of health care and reducing the costs of health care.  
Attaining these goals provides positive results to business, Government and individual citizens
alike.  In addition to fulfilling its legal duty to ensure that it is not submitting false or inaccurate
claims to Government and private payors, a billing company may gain numerous additional
benefits by implementing an effective compliance program.  These benefits may include:

<ul>
  <li>The formulation of effective internal controls to assure compliance with Federal regulations,
private payor policies and internal guidelines;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Improved medical record documentation;<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Improved collaboration, communication and cooperation among health care providers and
those processing and using health information;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to more quickly and accurately react to employees' operational compliance
concerns and the capability to effectively target resources to address those concerns;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A more efficient communications system that establishes a clear process and structure for
addressing compliance concerns quickly and effectively;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the billing company's
strong commitment to honest and responsible corporate conduct;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior relating to
fraud and abuse;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Increased likelihood of identification and prevention of criminal and unethical conduct;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes, regulations and other
program directives related to fraud and abuse and related issues;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A methodology that encourages employees to report potential problems;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of possible misconduct by corporate
officers, managers, employees and independent contractors, who can impact billing decisions;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>An improved relationship with the applicable Medicare contractor;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Early detection and reporting, minimizing the loss to the Government from false claims, and
thereby reducing the billing company's exposure to civil damages and penalties, criminal
sanctions, and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion;<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Enhancement of the structure of the billing company's operations and the consistency between
separate business units.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is a sound business investment
on the part of a billing company.

<p>The OIG recognizes the implementation of an effective compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud, abuse and waste from an organization.  However, a sincere effort by billing
companies to comply with applicable Federal and State standards, as well as the requirements of
private health care programs, through the establishment of an effective compliance program,
significantly reduces the risk of unlawful or improper conduct.<a name="_1_3"></a>

<p><strong>B.  <u>APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</u></strong> 

<p>Given the diversity in size and services offered by billing companies within the industry, there is
no single "best" compliance program.  The OIG understands the variances and complexities
within the industry and is sensitive to the differences between large and small billing companies.  
Similarly, the OIG understands the availability of resources for any one billing company can
differ vastly, given that billing companies vary greatly in the type of services offered and the
manner that they are provided.  Nonetheless, elements of this guidance can be used by all billing
companies, regardless of size, location or corporate structure, to establish an effective
compliance program.  The OIG recognizes some billing companies may not be able to adopt
certain elements to the same comprehensive degree that others with more extensive resources
may achieve.  This guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how a billing company can best
establish internal controls and monitor company conduct to correct and prevent fraudulent
activities.  By no means should the contents of this guidance be viewed as an exclusive
discussion of the advisable elements of a compliance program.  On the contrary, the OIG
strongly encourages billing companies to develop and implement compliance elements that
uniquely address the individual billing company's risk areas.

<p>The OIG appreciates that the success of the compliance program guidance hinges on thoughtful
and practical comments from those individuals and organizations that will utilize the tools set
forth in this document.  In a continuing effort to collaborate closely with the private sector, the
OIG solicited input and support from representatives of the major trade associations in the
development of this compliance program guidance.  Further, we took into consideration previous
OIG publications, such as Special Fraud Alerts,<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> the recent findings and recommendations in
reports issued by OIG's Office of Audit Services, comments from the Health Care Financing
Administration, as well as the experience of past and recent fraud investigations related to billing
companies conducted by OIG's Office of Investigations and the Department of Justice.

<p>As appropriate, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more information and
knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the law, and in the rules, policies and
procedures of the Federal, State and private health plans occur.  The OIG understands billing
companies will need adequate time to react to these modifications and expansions and to make
any necessary changes to their voluntary compliance programs.  New compliance practices may
eventually be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG discovers significant enhancements to
better ensure an effective compliance program.  We recognize the development and
implementation of compliance programs in billing companies often raise sensitive and complex
legal and managerial issues.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is critical
guidance for those who are sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant health care statutes
and regulations.<a name="_1_4"></a>

<p align="center"><strong>II.  COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong> 

<p>The elements proposed by these guidelines are similar to those of the clinical laboratory model
compliance program guidance published by the OIG in February 1997 (updated in August 1998),
the hospital compliance program guidance published in February 1998, the home health
compliance program guidance published in August 1998<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and our corporate integrity
agreements.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  The elements represent a guide that can be tailored to fit the needs and financial
realities of a particular billing company, large or small, regardless of the type of services offered.  
The OIG is cognizant that with regard to compliance programs, one model is not suitable to
every organization.  Nonetheless, the OIG believes every billing company, regardless of size,
structure or services offered can benefit from the principles espoused in this guidance.  

<p>The OIG firmly believes every effective compliance program must begin with a formal
commitment<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> by the billing company's governing body to include <u>all</u> of the applicable elements
listed below.  These elements are based on the seven steps of the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  We believe every billing company can implement all of the recommended
elements, expanding upon the seven steps of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The OIG
recognizes full implementation of all elements may not be immediately feasible for all billing
companies.  However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful commitment on the part of the
billing company administration, especially the governing body and the CEO, will substantially
contribute to the program's successful implementation.  As the compliance program is
implemented, that commitment should cascade down through the management to every
employee in the organization.

<p>At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include the following seven
elements:

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as written policies
and procedures that promote the billing company's commitment to compliance (<u>e.g.</u>, by including
adherence to the compliance program as an element in evaluating managers and employees) and
that address specific areas of potential fraud, such as the claims submission process, code gaming
and financial relationships with its providers;

<p>(2) The designation of a chief compliance officer and other appropriate bodies, <u>e.g.</u>, a corporate
compliance committee, charged with the responsibility of operating and monitoring the
compliance program and who report directly to the CEO and the governing body;<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training programs
for all affected employees;<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

<p>(4) The creation and maintenance of a process, such as a hotline, to receive complaints and the
adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of complainants and to protect callers from
retaliation;

<p>(5) The development of a system to respond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the
enforcement of appropriate disciplinary action against employees who have violated internal
compliance policies, applicable statutes, regulations or Federal, State or private payor health care
program requirements;

<p>(6) The use of audits and/or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist in
the reduction of identified problem areas;<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> and 

<p>(7) The investigation and correction of identified systemic problems and the development of
policies addressing the non-employment of sanctioned individuals.<a name="_1_5"></a>

<p><strong>A.  <u>WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</u></strong> 

<p>Every compliance program should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies, standards and practices that identify specific areas of risk and vulnerability
to the billing company.  These policies should be developed under the direction and supervision
of the chief compliance officer and the compliance committee (if such a committee is practicable
for the billing company) and, at a minimum, should be provided to all individuals who are
affected by the particular policy at issue, including the billing company's agents and independent
contractors<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> who may affect billing decisions.<a name="_1_6"></a>

<p><strong>1.  Standards of Conduct</strong> 

<p>Billing companies should develop standards of conduct for all affected employees that include a
clearly delineated commitment to compliance by the billing company's senior management<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20) </sup></a> 
and its divisions.  The standards should function in the same fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a
foundational document that details the fundamental principles, values and framework for action
within an organization.  Standards should articulate the billing company's commitment to comply
with all Federal and State standards, with an emphasis on preventing fraud and abuse.  They
should state the organization's mission, goals and ethical principles relating to compliance and
clearly define the organization's commitment to compliance and its expectations for all billing
company governing body members, officers, managers, employees and, where appropriate,
contractors and other agents.  The standards should promote integrity, support objectivity and
foster trust.  Standards should not only address compliance with statutes and regulations, but
should also set forth broad principles that guide employees in conducting business professionally
and properly.  Furthermore, a billing company's standards of conduct should reflect a
commitment to the highest quality health data submission, as evidenced by its accuracy,
reliability, timeliness and validity.<a name="_1_7"></a>

<p><strong>2.  Written Policies</strong> <strong>for Risk Areas</strong> 

<p>As part of its commitment to compliance, billing companies should establish a comprehensive
set of policies that delineate billing and coding procedures for the company.  In contrast to the
standards of conduct, which are designed to be a clear and concise collection of fundamental
standards, the written policies should articulate specific procedures personnel should follow
when submitting initial or follow-up claims to Federal health care programs.

<p>Among the issues to be addressed in the polices are the education and training requirements for
billing and coding personnel; the risk areas for fraud, waste and abuse; the integrity of the billing
company's information system; the methodology for resolving ambiguities in the provider's
paperwork;<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> the procedure for identifying and reporting credit balances; and the procedure to
ensure duplicate bills are not submitted in an attempt to gain duplicate payment.

<p>Billing companies that provide coding services should provide additional policies for risk areas
that apply specifically to coding.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>  The policies and procedures should describe the necessary
steps to take in reviewing a billing document.  Specific attention should be placed on the proper
steps the coder should take if unable to locate a code for a documented diagnosis or procedure or
if the medical record documentation is not sufficient to determine a diagnosis or procedure.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  
Billing companies that provide additional services should consider consulting an attorney for
guidance on other regulatory issues.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a><a name="_1_8"></a>

<p><strong>a.  Risk Assessment - All Billing Companies</strong> 

<p>The OIG believes a billing company's written policies and procedures, its educational program
and its audit and investigation plans should take into consideration the particular statutes, rules
and program instructions that apply to each function or department of the billing company.  
Consequently, we recommend coordination between these functions with an emphasis on areas
of special concern that have been identified by the OIG through its investigative and audit
functions.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  Furthermore, the OIG recommends that billing companies conduct a
comprehensive self-administered risk analysis or contract for an independent risk analysis by
experienced health care consulting professionals.  This risk analysis should identify and rank the
various compliance and business risks the company may experience in its daily operations.

<p>Once completed, the risk analysis should serve as the basis for the written policies the billing
company should develop.  The OIG has provided the following specific list of particular risk
areas that should be addressed by billing companies.  It should be noted that this list is not
all-encompassing and the risk analysis completed as a result of the company's audit may provide
a more individualized roadmap.  Nonetheless, this list is a compilation of several years of OIG
audits, investigations and evaluations and should provide a solid starting point for a company's
initial effort.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Among the risk areas the OIG has identified as particularly problematic are:<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

<ul>
  <li>Billing for items or services not actually documented;<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Unbundling;<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Upcoding,<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> such as, for example, "DRG creep;"<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Inappropriate balance billing;<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Inadequate resolution of overpayments;<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of integrity in computer systems;<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Computer software programs that encourage billing personnel to enter data in fields indicating
services were rendered though not actually performed or documented;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Failure to maintain the confidentiality of information/records;<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Knowing misuse of provider identification numbers, which results in improper billing;<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Outpatient services rendered in connection with inpatient stays;<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Duplicate billing in an attempt to gain duplicate payment;<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Billing for discharge in lieu of transfer;<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Failure to properly use modifiers;<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Billing company incentives that violate the anti-kickback statute or other similar Federal or
State statute or regulation;<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Joint ventures;<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Routine waiver of copayments and billing third-party insurance only;<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Discounts and professional courtesy.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>A billing company's prior history of noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations and
Federal health care program requirements may indicate additional types of risk areas where the
billing company may be vulnerable and may require necessary policy measures to prevent
avoidable recurrence.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>  Additional risk areas should be assessed by billing companies as well as
incorporated into the written policies and procedures and training elements developed as part of
their compliance programs.

<p>Billing companies that do not code bills should implement policies that require notification to the
provider who is coding to implement and follow compliance safeguards with respect to
documentation of services rendered.  Moreover, the OIG recommends that billing companies
who do not code for their provider clients incorporate in their contractual agreements the
provider's acknowledgment and agreement to address the following coding compliance
safeguards.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a><a name="_1_9"></a>

<p><strong>b.  Risk Assessment - Billing Companies that Provide Coding Services</strong> 

<p>The written policies and procedures concerning proper coding should reflect the current
reimbursement principles set forth in applicable statutes, regulations<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> and Federal, State or
private payor health care program requirements and should be developed in tandem with
organizational standards.  Furthermore, written policies and procedures should ensure that coding
and billing are based on medical record documentation.  Particular attention should be paid to
issues of appropriate diagnosis codes, DRG coding, individual Medicare Part B claims (including
documentation guidelines for evaluation and management services) and the use of patient
discharge codes.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  The billing company should also institute a policy that all rejected claims
pertaining to diagnosis and procedure codes be reviewed by the coder or the coding department.  
This should facilitate a reduction in similar errors.  Among the risk areas that billing companies
who provide coding services should address are:

<ul>
  <li>Internal coding practices;<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>"Assumption" coding;<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Alteration of the documentation;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Coding without proper documentation<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> of all physician and other professional services;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Billing for services provided by unqualified or unlicensed clinical personnel;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Availability of all necessary documentation at the time of coding; and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Employment of sanctioned individuals.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Billing companies that provide coding services should maintain an up-to-date, user-friendly
index for coding policies and procedures to ensure that specific information can be readily
located.  Similarly, for billing companies that provide coding services, the billing company
should assure that essential coding materials are readily accessible to all coding staff.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>  Finally,
billing companies should emphasize in their standards the importance of safeguarding the
confidentiality of medical, financial and other personal information in their possession.<a name="_1_10"></a>

<p><strong>3.  Claim Submission Process</strong> 

<p>A number of the risk areas identified above, pertaining to the claim development and submission
process, have been the subject of administrative proceedings, as well as investigations and
prosecutions under the civil False Claims Act and criminal statutes.  Settlement of these cases
often has required the defendants to execute corporate integrity agreements, in addition to paying
significant civil damages and/or criminal fines and penalties.  These corporate integrity
agreements have provided the OIG with a mechanism to advise billing companies concerning
acceptable practices to ensure compliance with applicable Federal and State statutes, regulations
and program requirements.  The following recommendations include a number of provisions
from various corporate integrity agreements.  Although these recommendations include examples
of effective policies, each billing company should develop its own specific policies tailored to fit
its individual needs.

<p>With respect to claims, a billing company's written policies and procedures should reflect and
reinforce current Federal and State statutes.  The policies must create a mechanism for the billing
or reimbursement staff to communicate effectively and accurately with the health care provider.  
Policies and procedures should:

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that proper and timely documentation of all physician and other professional services
is obtained prior to billing to ensure that only accurate and properly documented services are billed;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Emphasize that claims should be submitted only when appropriate documentation supports
the claims and only when such documentation is maintained, appropriately organized in
legible form and available for audit and review.  The documentation, which may include
patient records, should record the time spent in conducting the activity leading to the record
entry and the identity of the individual providing the service;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Indicate that the diagnosis and procedures reported on the reimbursement claim should be
based on the medical record and other documentation and that the documentation necessary
for accurate code assignment should be available to coding staff at the time of coding.  The
Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS),
International Classification of Disease (ICD), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), any
other applicable code or revenue code (or successor code(s)) used by the coding staff should
accurately describe the service that was ordered by the physician;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Provide that the compensation for billing department coders and billing consultants should not
provide any financial incentive to improperly upcode claims;<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Establish and maintain a process for pre- and post-submission review of claims<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> to ensure
claims submitted for reimbursement accurately represent services provided, are supported by
sufficient documentation and are in conformity with any applicable coverage criteria for
reimbursement; and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain clarification from the provider when documentation is confusing or lacking adequate
justification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because coding for providers often involves the interpretation of medical diagnosis and other
clinical data and documentation, a billing company may wish to contract with/assign a qualified
physician to provide guidance to the coding staff regarding clinical issues.  Procedures should be
in place to access medical experts when necessary.  Such procedures should allow for medical
personnel to be available for guidance without interrupting or interfering with the quality of
patient care.<a name="_1_11"></a>

<p><strong>4.  Credit Balances</strong> 

<p>Credit balances occur when payments, allowances or charge reversals posted to an account
exceed the charges to the account.  Providers and their billers should establish policies and
procedures, as well as responsibility, for timely and appropriate identification and resolution of
these overpayments.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  For example, a billing company may redesignate segments of its
information system to allow for the segregation of patient accounts reflecting credit balances.  
The billing company could remove these accounts from the active accounts and place them in a
holding account pending the processing of a reimbursement claim to the appropriate payor.  A
billing company's information system should have the ability to print out the individual patient
accounts that reflect a credit balance in order to permit simplified tracking of credit balances.  
The billing company should maintain a complete audit trail of all credit balances.

<p>In addition, a billing company should designate at least one person (<u>e.g.</u>, in the patient accounts
department or reasonable equivalent thereof) as having the responsibility for the tracking,
recording and reporting of credit balances.  Further, a comptroller or an accountant in the billing
company's accounting department (or reasonable equivalent thereof) may review reports of credit
balances and adjustments on a monthly basis as an additional safeguard.<a name="_1_12"></a>

<p><strong>5.  Integrity of Data Systems</strong> 

<p>Increasingly, the health care industry is using electronic data interchange (EDI) to conduct
business more quickly and efficiently.  As a result, the industry is relying on the capabilities of
computers.  Billing companies should establish procedures for maintaining the integrity of its
data collection systems.  This should include procedures for regularly backing-up data (either by
diskette, restricted system or tape) to ensure the accuracy of all data collected in connection with
submission of claims and reporting of credit balances.  At all times, the billing company should
have a complete and accurate audit trail.  Additionally, billing companies should develop a
system to prevent the contamination of data by outside parties.  This system should include
regularly scheduled virus checks.  Finally, billing companies should ensure that electronic data
are protected against unauthorized access or disclosure.<a name="_1_13"></a> 

<p><strong>6.  Retention of Records</strong> 

<p>Billing company compliance programs should provide for the implementation of a records
system.  This system should establish policies and procedures regarding the creation,
distribution, retention, storage, retrieval and destruction of documents.  The three types of
documents developed under this system should include:  1) all records and documentation
required by either Federal or State law and the program requirements of Federal, State and
private health plans (for billing companies, this should include all documents related to the
billing and coding process); 2) records listing the persons responsible for implementing each part
of the compliance plan; and 3) all records necessary to protect the integrity of the billing
company's compliance process and confirm the effectiveness of the program.  The
documentation necessary to satisfy the third requirement includes:  evidence of adequate
employee training; reports from the billing company's hotline; results of any investigation
conducted as a consequence of a hotline call; modifications to the compliance program;
self-disclosure; all written notifications to providers;<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> and the results of the billing company's
auditing and monitoring efforts.<a name="_1_14"></a>

<p><strong>7.  Compliance as an Element of a Performance Plan</strong> 

<p>Compliance programs should require that the promotion of, and adherence to, the elements of the
compliance program be a factor in evaluating the performance of all employees.  Employees
should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and procedures.  In addition, all
managers and supervisors involved in the coding  and claims submission processes should:

<ul>
  <li>Discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance policies and
legal requirements applicable to their function;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and requirements is
a condition of employment; and <br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Disclose to all supervised personnel that the billing company will take disciplinary action up
to and including termination for violation of these policies or requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to making performance of these duties an element in evaluations, the compliance
officer or company management should include a policy that managers and supervisors will be
sanctioned for failure to instruct adequately their subordinates or for failure to detect
noncompliance with applicable policies and legal requirements, where reasonable diligence on
the part of the manager or supervisor should have led to the discovery of any problems or
violations.<a name="_1_15"></a>

<p><strong>B</strong>.  <strong><u>DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE
COMMITTEE</u></strong><a name="_1_16"></a> 

<p><strong>1.  Compliance Officer</strong> 

<p>Every billing company should designate a compliance officer to serve as the focal point for
compliance activities.  This responsibility may be the individual's sole duty or added to other
management responsibilities, depending upon the size and resources of the billing company and
the complexity of the task.  For those billing companies that have limited resources, the
compliance function could be outsourced to an expert in compliance.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>

<p>Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate authority is critical to the success of the
program, necessitating the appointment of a high-level official in the billing company with direct
access to the company's governing body, the CEO, all other senior management and legal
counsel.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  The officer should have sufficient funding and staff to perform his or her
responsibilities fully.  Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance
officer with regard to planning, implementing and monitoring the compliance program.  With
this in mind, the OIG recommends the billing company's compliance officer closely coordinate
compliance functions with the provider's compliance officer.

<p>The compliance officer's primary responsibilities should include:

<ul>
  <li>Overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program;<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Reporting on a regular basis to the billing company's governing body, CEO and compliance
committee (if applicable) on the progress of implementation, and assisting these components
in establishing methods to improve the billing company's efficiency and quality of services
and to reduce the billing company's vulnerability to fraud, abuse and waste;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs and in the law
and policies and procedures of Government and private payor health plans;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewing employees' certifications that they have received, read and understood the
standards of conduct;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Developing, coordinating and participating in a multifaceted educational and training program
that focuses on the elements of the compliance program and seeks to ensure that all
appropriate employees and management are knowledgeable of, and comply with, pertinent
Federal and State standards;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Coordinating personnel issues with the billing company's human resources/personnel office
(or its equivalent) to ensure that providers and employees do not appear in the Cumulative
Sanction Report;<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Assisting the billing company's financial management in coordinating internal compliance
review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of departments;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including the
flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding to reports of
problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action with all billing
departments, providers and sub-providers, agents and, if appropriate, independent contractors;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Developing policies and programs that encourage managers and employees to report
suspected fraud and other improprieties without fear of retaliation; and <br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Continuing the momentum of the compliance program and the accomplishment of its
objectives long after the initial years of implementation.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other information
that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to, patient records (where
appropriate), billing records and records concerning the marketing efforts of the facility and the
billing company's arrangements with other parties, including employees, professionals on staff,
relevant independent contractors, suppliers, agents, supplemental staffing entities and physicians. 
This policy enables the compliance officer to review contracts and obligations (seeking the
advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that may contain referral and payment provisions that
could violate statutory or regulatory requirements.

<p>In addition, the compliance officer should be copied on the results of all internal audit reports
and work closely with key managers to identify aberrant trends in the coding and billing areas.  
The compliance officer should ascertain patterns that require a change in policy and forward
these issues to the compliance committee to remedy the problem.  A compliance officer should
have full authority to stop the processing of claims that he or she believes are problematic until
such time as the issue in question has been resolved.<a name="_1_17"></a> 

<p><strong>2.  Compliance Committee</strong> 

<p>The OIG recommends, where feasible,<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> that a compliance committee be established to advise
the compliance officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>  When
assembling a team of people to serve as the billing company's compliance committee, the
company should include individuals with a variety of skills.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>  Appropriate members of the
compliance committee include the director of billing and the director of coding.  The OIG
strongly recommends that the compliance officer manage the compliance committee.  Once a
billing company chooses the people that will accept the responsibilities vested in members of the
compliance committee, the billing company must train these individuals on the policies and
procedures of the compliance program.

<p>The committee's responsibilities should include:

<ul>
  <li>Analyzing the organization's regulatory environment, the legal requirements with which it
must comply<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a> and specific risk areas;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Assessing existing policies and procedures that address these areas for possible incorporation
into the compliance program;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Working with appropriate departments to develop standards of conduct and policies and
procedures that promote allegiance to the company's compliance program;<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's standards,
policies and procedures as part of its daily operations;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Determining the appropriate strategy/approach to promote compliance with the program and
detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other fraud reporting mechanisms;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Developing a system to solicit, evaluate and respond to complaints and problems; and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of identifying
troublesome issues and deficient areas experienced by the billing company and implementing
corrective and preventive action.</li>
</ul>

<p>The committee may also address other functions as the compliance concept becomes part of the
overall operating structure and daily routine.<a name="_1_18"></a>

<p><strong>C. <u>CONDUCTING  EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong><a name="_1_19"></a> 

<p><strong>1. Initial Training in Compliance</strong> 

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, employees, and the continual
retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant elements of an effective compliance
program.  In order to ensure the appropriate information is being disseminated to the correct
individuals, the training should be separated into two sessions, depending on the employees'
involvement in the submission of claims for reimbursement.  All employees should attend the
general session on compliance, while employees whose job primarily focuses on submission of
claims for reimbursement should be the participants in the detailed sessions.

<p>In the development of a training program, the billing company should consult with its provider
clients to ensure that a consistent message is being delivered and avoid any potential conflicts in
the implementation of policies and procedures.<a name="_1_20"></a>

<p><strong>a.  General Sessions</strong> 

<p>As part of their compliance programs, billing companies should require all affected personnel to
attend training on an annual basis, including appropriate training in Federal and State statutes,
regulations and guidelines, the policies of private payors and training in corporate ethics.  The
general training sessions should emphasize the organization's commitment to compliance with
these legal requirements and policies.

<p>These training programs should include sessions highlighting the organization's compliance
program, summarizing fraud and abuse statutes and regulations, Federal, State and private payor
health care program requirements, coding requirements, claim submission processes and
marketing practices that reflect current legal and program standards.  The organization must take
steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all affected employees,
physicians, independent contractors and other significant agents, <u>e.g.</u>, by requiring participation
in training programs and disseminating publications that explain specific requirements in a
practical manner.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>  Managers of specific departments or groups can assist in identifying areas
that require training and in carrying out such training.<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>  Training instructors may come from
outside or inside the organization.  New employees should be targeted for training early in their
employment.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>

<p>As part of the initial training, the standards of conduct should be distributed to all employees.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  
At the end of this training session, every employee, as well as contracted consultants, should be
required to sign and date a statement that reflects the employee's knowledge of and commitment
to the standards of conduct.

<p>This attestation should be retained in the employee's personnel file.  For contracted consultants,
the attestation should become part of the contract and remain in the<a name="training"></a> file that contains such
documentation.  Further, to assist in ensuring employees continuously meet the expected high
standards set forth in the code of conduct, any employee handbook delineating or expanding
upon these standards of conduct should be regularly updated as applicable statutes, regulations
and Federal health care program requirements are modified.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a>  Billing companies should<a name="training 2"></a> provide
an additional attestation in the modified standards that stipulates the employee's knowledge of
and commitment to the modifications.<a name="_1_21"></a>

<p><strong>b.  Coding and Billing Training</strong> 

<p>In addition to specific training in the risk areas identified in section II.A.2, above, primary
training to appropriate corporate officers, managers and other billing company staff should
include such topics as:

<ul>
  <li>Specific Government and private payor reimbursement principles;<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>General prohibitions on paying or receiving remuneration to induce referrals;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Proper selection and sequencing of diagnoses;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Improper alterations to documentation;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Submitting a claim for physician services when rendered by a non-physician (<u>i.e.</u>, the
"incident to" rule and the physician physical presence requirement);<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Proper documentation of services rendered, including the correct application of official coding
rules and guidelines;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Signing a form for a physician without the physician's authorization; and <br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational programs are
particularly relevant to a billing company's marketing and financial personnel, in that the
pressure to meet business goals may render these employees particularly vulnerable to engaging
in prohibited practices.<a name="_1_22"></a>

<p><strong>2.  Format of the Training Program</strong> 

<p>The OIG suggests all relevant levels of personnel be made part of various educational and
training programs of the billing company.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>  Employees should be required to have a minimum
number of educational hours per year, as appropriate, as part of their employment
responsibilities.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>  For example, as discussed above, certain employees involved in billing
functions should be required to attend periodic training in applicable reimbursement coverage
and documentation of records.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> 

<p>A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training and training in several different
languages, particularly where a billing company has a culturally diverse staff, should be
implemented so that all affected employees are knowledgeable about the institution's standards
of conduct and procedures for alerting senior management to problems and concerns.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>  
Targeted training should be provided to corporate officers, managers and other employees whose
actions affect the accuracy of the claims submitted to the Government, such as employees
involved in the coding, billing and marketing processes.  All training materials should be
designed to take into account the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual trainees.  
Given the complexity and interdependent relationships of many departments, it is important for
the compliance officer to supervise and coordinate the training program.

<p>The OIG recommends attendance and participation at training programs be made a condition of
continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements should result in
disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is serious.  Adherence to
the provisions of the compliance program, such as training requirements, should be a factor in
the annual evaluation of each employee.  The billing company should retain adequate records of
its training of employees, including attendance logs and material distributed at training sessions.<a name="_1_23"></a>

<p><strong>3.  Continuing Education on Compliance Issues</strong> 

<p>It is essential that compliance issues remain at the forefront of the billing company's priorities.  
The OIG recommends billing company compliance programs address the need for periodic
professional education courses for billing company personnel.  In particular, the billing company
should ensure that coding personnel receive annual professional training on the updated codes for
the current year.

<p>In order to maintain a sense of seriousness about compliance in the billing company's operations,
the billing company must continue to disseminate the compliance message.  One effective
mechanism for maintaining a consistent presence of the compliance message is to publish a
monthly newsletter to address compliance concerns.  This would allow the billing company to
address specific examples of problems the company encountered during its ongoing audits and
risk analysis, while reinforcing the company's firm commitment to the general principles of
compliance and ethical conduct.  The newsletter could also include the risk areas published by
the OIG in its Special Fraud Alerts.  Finally, the billing company could use the newsletter as a
mechanism to address areas of ambiguity in the coding and billing process.  The billing company
should maintain its newsletters in a central location to document the guidance offered and
provide new employees with access to guidance previously provided. <a name="_1_24"></a> 

<p><strong>D. <u>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong><a name="_1_25"></a> 

<p><strong>1.  Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> 

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and the billing company
personnel is equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program and the
reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse and waste.  Written confidentiality and non-retaliation
policies should be developed and distributed to all employees to encourage communication and
the reporting of incidents of potential fraud.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>  The compliance committee should also develop
several independent reporting paths for an employee to report fraud, waste or abuse so that such
reports cannot be diverted by supervisors or other personnel.

<p>The OIG encourages the establishment of procedures for personnel to seek clarification from the
compliance officer or members of the compliance committee in the event of any confusion or
question regarding a company policy, practice or procedure.  Questions and responses should be
documented and dated and, if appropriate, shared with other staff so that standards, policies,
practices and procedures can be updated and improved to reflect any necessary changes or
clarifications.  The compliance officer may want to solicit employee input in developing these
communication and reporting systems.<a name="_1_26"></a> 

<p><strong>2.  Hotlines</strong> <strong>and Other Forms of Communication</strong> 

<p>The OIG encourages the use of hotlines<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a> (including anonymous hotlines), e-mails, written
memoranda, newsletters and other forms of information exchange to maintain these open lines of
communication.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>  If the billing company establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be
made readily available to all employees and independent contractors, by circulating the number
on wallet cards or conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  
Employees should be permitted to report matters on an anonymous basis.  Matters reported
through the hotline or other communication sources that suggest substantial violations of
compliance policies, Federal, State or private payor health care program requirements,
regulations or statutes should be documented and investigated promptly to determine their
veracity.  A log should be maintained by the compliance officer that records such calls, including
the nature of any investigation and its results.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>  Such information should be included in reports
to the governing body, the CEO and compliance committee.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>  Further, while the billing
company should always strive to maintain the confidentiality of an employee's identity, it should
also explicitly communicate that there may be a point where the individual's identity may
become known or may have to be revealed.

<p>The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by employees who may have participated
in illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex legal and
management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis.  The compliance officer
should work closely with legal counsel, who can provide guidance regarding such issues.<a name="_1_27"></a>

<p><strong>E. <u>ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED    DISCIPLINARY
GUIDELINES</u></strong><a name="_1_28"></a> 

<p><strong>1.  Discipline Policy and Actions</strong> 

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action for
corporate officers, managers and employees who have failed to comply with the billing
company's standards of conduct, policies and procedures, Federal, State or private payor health
care program requirements, or Federal and State laws, or those who have otherwise engaged in
wrongdoing, which has the potential to impair the billing company's status as a reliable, honest
and trustworthy organization.

<p>The OIG believes the compliance program should include a written policy statement setting forth
the degrees of disciplinary actions that may be imposed upon corporate officers, managers and
employees for failing to comply with the billing company's standards and policies and applicable
statutes and regulations.  Intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject transgressors to
significant sanctions.  Such sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension, termination
or financial penalties, as appropriate.  Each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis
to determine the appropriate sanction.  The written standards of conduct should elaborate on the
procedures for handling disciplinary problems and identify who will be responsible for taking
appropriate action.  Some disciplinary actions can be handled by department managers, while
others may have to be resolved by a senior manager.  Disciplinary action may be appropriate
where a responsible employee's failure to detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence
or reckless conduct.  Personnel should be advised by the billing company that disciplinary action
will be taken on a fair and equitable basis.  Managers and supervisors should be made aware that
they have a responsibility to discipline employees in an appropriate and consistent manner.

<p>It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of possible disciplinary actions for improper
conduct and to educate officers and other staff regarding these standards.  The consequences of
noncompliance should be consistently applied and enforced for the disciplinary policy to have
the required deterrent effect.  All levels of employees should be subject to the same disciplinary
action for the commission of similar offenses.  The commitment to compliance applies to all
personnel levels within a billing company.  The OIG believes that corporate officers, managers
and supervisors should be held accountable for failing to comply with, or for the foreseeable
failure of their subordinates to adhere to, the applicable standards, laws, rules, program
instructions and procedures.<a name="_1_29"></a> 

<p><strong>2.  New Employee Policy</strong> 

<p>For all new employees who have discretionary authority to make decisions that may involve
compliance with the law or compliance oversight, billing companies should conduct a reasonable
and prudent background investigation, including a reference check, as part of every such
employment application.  The application should specifically require the applicant to disclose
any criminal conviction, as defined by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7(i), or exclusion action.  Pursuant to
the compliance program, billing company policies should prohibit the employment of individuals
who have been recently convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are listed as
debarred, excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>  In
addition, pending the resolution of any criminal charges or proposed debarment or exclusion, the
OIG recommends that such individuals should be removed from direct responsibility for, or
involvement in, any Federal health care program.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>  Similarly, with regard to current employees
or independent contractors, if resolution of the matter results in conviction, debarment or
exclusion, then the billing company should remove the individual from direct responsibility for
or involvement with all Federal health care programs.<a name="Auditing"></a><a name="_1_30"></a>

<p><strong>F. <u>AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong> 

<p>An ongoing evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program.  The OIG believes
an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of its implementation and regular
reporting to senior company officers.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a>  Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring,
including reports of suspected noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance officer
and reviewed with the billing company's senior management and the compliance committee.  
The extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors such as the size of
the company, the resources available to the company, the company's prior history of
noncompliance and the risk factors that are prevalent in a particular billing company.

<p>Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and ensure
compliance is the performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or external
auditors who have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes, regulations, and Federal,
State and private payor health care program requirements.  The audits should focus on the billing
company's programs or divisions, including external relationships with third-party contractors,
specifically those with substantive exposure to Government enforcement actions.  At a
minimum, these audits should be designed to address the billing company's compliance with
laws governing kickback arrangements, coding practices, claim submission, reimbursement and
marketing.  In addition, the audits and reviews should examine the billing company's compliance
with specific rules and policies that have been the focus of particular attention on the part of the
Medicare fiscal intermediaries or carriers, and law enforcement, as evidenced by OIG Special
Fraud Alerts, OIG audits and evaluations, and law enforcement's initiatives.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>  In addition, the
billing company should focus on any areas of specific concern identified within that billing
company and those that may have been identified by any outside agency, whether Federal or
State.

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer to
identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>  Significant variations from the
baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine the cause of the deviation.  If the
inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for legitimate, explainable reasons, the
compliance officer or manager may want to limit any corrective action or take no action.  If it is
determined that the deviation was caused by improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules,
including fraud and systemic problems, the billing company should take prompt steps to correct
the problem.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>  Any overpayments discovered as a result of such deviations should be reported
promptly to the appropriate provider, with appropriate documentation and a thorough explanation
of the reason for the overpayment.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>

<p>An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at a minimum, annual)
reviews of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>, whether there
has been appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, training, ongoing educational
programs and disciplinary actions, among others.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>  This process will verify actual conformance
by all departments with the compliance program.  Such reviews could support a determination
that appropriate records have been created and maintained to document the implementation of an
effective program.  However, when monitoring discloses deviations were not detected in a timely
manner due to program deficiencies, appropriate modifications must be implemented.  Such
evaluations, when developed with the support of management, can help ensure compliance with
the billing company's policies and procedures.

<p>As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider techniques
such as: 

<ul>
  <li>On-site visits;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Testing billing and coding staff on their knowledge of reimbursement and coverage criteria
(<u>e.g</u>., presenting hypothetical scenarios of situations experienced in daily practice and assess responses);<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Unannounced mock surveys, audits and investigations;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Examination of the billing company's complaint logs;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Checking personnel records to determine whether any individuals who have been reprimanded
for compliance issues in the past are among those currently engaged in improper conduct;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Interviews with personnel involved in management, operations, coding, claim development
and submission and other related activities;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of a broad cross-section of the billing
company's employees and staff;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Reviews of written materials and documentation prepared by the different divisions of a
billing company; and <br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Trend analyses, or longitudinal studies, that seek deviations, positive or negative, in specific
areas over a given period.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewers should:

<ul>
  <li>Possess the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential issues
with the subject matter to be reviewed;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Be objective and independent of line management;<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel and all relevant
areas of operation;<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing body
members of the compliance committee and its provider clients on a regular basis, but not less
than annually;<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a> and<br>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these reports, management can take whatever steps are necessary to correct past problems
and prevent them from recurring.  In certain cases, subsequent reviews or studies would be
advisable to ensure that the recommended corrective actions have been implemented
successfully.

<p>The billing company should document its efforts to comply with applicable statutes, regulations
and Federal health care program requirements.  For example, where a billing company, in its
efforts to comply with a particular statute, regulation or program requirement, requests advice
from a Government agency (including a Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier) charged with
administering a Federal health care program, the billing company should document and retain a
record of the request and any written or oral response.  This step is extremely important if the
billing company intends to rely on that response to guide it in future decisions, actions or claim
reimbursement requests or appeals.  A log of oral inquiries between the billing company and
third parties will help the organization document its attempts at compliance.  In addition, the
billing company should maintain records relevant to the issue of whether its reliance was
"reasonable," and whether it exercised due diligence in developing procedures to implement the
advice.<a name="_1_31"></a> 

<p><strong>G. <u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE
ACTION INITIATIVES</u></strong><a name="_1_32"></a> 

<p><strong>1.  Violations and Investigations</strong> 

<p>Violations of the billing company's compliance program, failures to comply with applicable
Federal or State law, rules and program instructions and other types of misconduct threaten a
billing company's status as a reliable, honest and trustworthy company.  Detected but uncorrected
misconduct can seriously endanger the mission, reputation and legal status of the billing
company.  Consequently, upon reports or reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance, it
is important that the chief compliance officer or other management officials promptly investigate
the conduct in question to determine whether a material violation of applicable law, rule or
program instruction or the requirements of the compliance program has occurred, and if so, take
steps to correct the problem.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>  As appropriate, such steps may include an immediate referral to
criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities, a corrective action plan,<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> a report to the
Government,<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> and the notification to the provider of any discrepancies or overpayments, if
applicable.

<p>Even if the overpayment detection and return process is working and is being monitored by the
billing company's audit or coding divisions, the OIG still believes that the compliance officer
needs to be made aware of these significant overpayments, violations or deviations that may
reveal trends or patterns indicative of a systemic problem.

<p>Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will probably
include interviews and a review of relevant documents.  Some billing companies should consider
engaging outside counsel, auditors or health care experts to assist in an investigation.  Records of
the investigation should contain documentation of the alleged violation, a description of the
investigative process (including the objectivity of the investigators and methodologies utilized),
copies of interview notes and key documents, a log of the witnesses interviewed and the
documents reviewed, the results of the investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken and any
corrective action implemented.  Although any action taken as the result of an investigation will
necessarily vary depending upon the billing company and the situation, billing companies should
strive for some consistency by utilizing sound practices and disciplinary protocols.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  Further,
after a reasonable period, the compliance officer should review the circumstances that formed the
basis for the investigation to determine whether similar problems have been uncovered or
modifications of the compliance program are necessary to prevent and detect other inappropriate
conduct or violations.

<p>If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer believes the
integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of employees under
investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work activity until the
investigation is completed (unless an internal or Government-led undercover operation known to
the billing company is in effect).  In addition, the compliance officer should take appropriate
steps to secure or prevent the destruction of documents or other evidence relevant to the
investigation.  If the billing company determines disciplinary action is warranted, it should be
prompt and imposed in accordance with the billing company's written standards of disciplinary
action.<a name="_1_33"></a>

<p><strong>2.  Reporting</strong><a name="_1_34"></a> 

<p><strong>a.  Obligations based on Billing Company Misconduct</strong> 

<p>If the compliance officer, compliance committee or a management official discovers credible
evidence of misconduct by the billing company from any source and, after reasonable inquiry,
has reason to believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil or administrative law,<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a>
then the billing company should report the existence of misconduct promptly to the appropriate
Government authority<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a> within a reasonable period, but not more than sixty (60) days after
determining that there is credible evidence of a violation.  Prompt reporting will demonstrate the
billing company's good faith and willingness to work with governmental authorities to correct
and remedy the problem.  In addition, reporting such conduct will be considered a mitigating
factor by the OIG in determining administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments and
exclusion), if the reporting company becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a><a name="_1_35"></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>b.  Obligations based on Provider Misconduct</strong> 

<p>Billing companies are in a unique position to discover various types of fraud, waste, abuse and
mistakes on the part of the provider for which they furnish services.  This unique access to
information may place the billing company in a precarious position.  On the one hand, the billing
company's allegiance is to the provider client.  On the other, the billing company maintains a
commitment to compliance with the applicable Federal and State laws, and the program
requirements of Federal, State and private health plans.  The OIG recognizes the importance of
maintaining a positive and interactive communication between billing companies and the
providers they service.  It is with this understanding that the OIG has addressed the issue of
obligations on the part of third-party medical billing companies with regard to provider
misconduct.

<p>If the billing company finds evidence of misconduct<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a> (<u>e.g.</u>, inaccurate claim submission) on
the part of the provider that they service, the billing company should refrain from the submission
of questionable claims and notify the provider in writing within thirty (30) days of such a
determination.  This notification should include all claim specific information and the rationale
for such a determination.

<p>If the billing company discovers credible evidence of the provider's continued misconduct or
flagrant fraudulent or abusive conduct,<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a> the billing company should:  (1) refrain from
submitting any false or inappropriate claims; (2) terminate the contract; and/or (3) report the
misconduct to the appropriate Federal and State authorities within a reasonable time, but not
more than sixty (60) days after determining that there is credible evidence of a violation.<a name="_1_36"></a> 

<p><strong>c.  Reporting Procedure</strong> 

<p>When reporting misconduct to the Government, a billing company should provide all evidence
relevant to the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State law(s) and the potential cost
impact.  The compliance officer, with guidance from the governmental authorities, could be
requested to continue to investigate the reported violation.  Once the investigation is completed,
the compliance officer should be required to notify the appropriate governmental authority of the
outcome of the investigation, including a description of the impact of the alleged violation on the
operation of the applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries.  If the investigation
ultimately reveals  criminal, civil or administrative violations have occurred, the appropriate
Federal and State officials<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a> shou<a name="ld be notified immediately."></a>ld be notified immediately.<a name="_1_37"></a> 

<p><strong>3.  Corrective Actions</strong> 

<p>Billing companies play a critical role in the restitution of overpayments to appropriate payors.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> 
As previously stated, billing companies should take appropriate corrective action, including
prompt identification of any overpayment to the provider and the affected payor and the
imposition of proper disciplinary action, if applicable.  Failure to notify authorities of an
overpayment within a reasonable period of time could be interpreted as an intentional attempt to
conceal the overpayment from the Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a
criminal violation with respect to the billing company, as well as any individuals who may have
been involved.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  For this reason, billing company compliance programs should ensure that
overpayments are identified quickly and encourage their providers to promptly return
overpayments obtained from Medicare or other Federal health care programs.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a><a name="_1_38"></a>

<p align="center"><strong>III.  CONCLUSION</strong> 

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation to the process necessary
to develop an effective and cost-efficient third-party medical billing compliance program.  As
previously stated, however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources of an
individual billing company, depending upon its particular corporate structure, mission and
employee composition.  The statutes, regulations and guidelines of the Federal and State health
insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private health plans, should be
integrated into every billing company's compliance program.

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches millions of
beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly evolving.  In particular,
the billing process has changed dramatically in recent years.  As a result, the time is right for
billing companies to implement strong, voluntary compliance programs.  As stated throughout
this guidance, compliance is a dynamic process that helps to ensure billing companies are better
able to fulfill their commitment to ethical behavior, and to meet the changes and challenges being
imposed upon them by Congress and private insurers.  Ultimately, it is OIG's hope that
voluntarily created compliance programs will enable billing companies to meet their goals and
substantially reduce fraud, waste and abuse, as well as the cost of health care to Federal, State
and private health insurers.<a name="N_1_"></a>

<p>FOOTNOTES:

<p>1. For the purposes of this compliance program guidance, "third-party medical billing
companies" include clearinghouses and value-added networks.<a name="N_2_"></a>

<p>2. Recent survey results from the Healthcare Billing and Management Association (HBMA)
show that its membership processes more than 17.6 million claims per month totaling $18 billion
a year.<a name="N_3_"></a>

<p>3. For the purposes of this compliance program guidance, "provider" shall include any
individual, company, corporation or organization that submits claims for reimbursement to a
Federal health care program.  The term "Federal health care programs" is applied in this
document as defined in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(f), which includes any plan or program that
provides health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded
directly, in whole or in part by the United States Federal Government (<u>i.e.</u>, via programs such as
Medicare, Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Black Lung, or Longshore and Harbor
Worker's Compensation Act) or any State health plan (<u>e.g.</u>, Medicaid, or program receiving
funds from block grants for social services or child health services).  Also, for purposes of this
document, the term "Federal health care program requirements" refers to the statutes, regulations,
rules, requirements, directives and instructions governing Medicare, Medicaid and all other
Federal health care programs.<a name="N_4_"></a> 

<p>4. Billing companies provide services for virtually every aspect of the health care industry. 
Among the areas of greatest concentration for  billing companies are:  physicians, ambulatory
surgery centers (ASCs), durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies
(DMEPOS) industry, home health agencies (HHAs) and hospitals.<a name="N_5_"></a> 

<p>5. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 45076 (8/24/98) for Compliance Program Guidance for Clinical
Laboratories; 63 Fed. Reg. 42410 (8/7/98) for Compliance Program Guidance for Home Health
Agencies; 63 Fed. Reg. 8987 (2/23/98) for Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals.  These
documents are also located on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig.<a name="N_6_"></a> 

<p>6. <u>E.g.</u>, the billing company should communicate the results of audits, determinations of
inappropriate claim submissions and notifications of overpayments.<a name="N_7_"></a> 

<p>7. At a minimum, the billing company should send a copy of its compliance program to all of its
provider clients.  The billing company should also coordinate with its provider clients in the
development of a training program, an audit plan and policies for investigating misconduct.<a name="N_8_"></a> 

<p>8. Billing and coding personnel can provide critical advice to physicians and other health care
providers that may greatly improve the quality of medical record documentation.<a name="N_9_"></a> 

<p>9. The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an <u>effective</u> compliance program that
pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the appropriateness of administrative
sanctions.  However, the burden is on the billing company to demonstrate the operational
effectiveness of a compliance program.  Further, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3729-3733,
provides that a person who has violated the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the
Government within thirty days of detection, in certain circumstances will be subject to not less
than double, as opposed to treble, damages.  <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3729(a).  Thus, the ability to react
quickly when violations of the law are discovered may materially help reduce the billing
company's liability.<a name="N_10_"></a> 

<p>10. Special Fraud Alerts are available on the OIG website at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig.<a name="N_11_"></a> 
<p>11. Nothing stated herein should be substituted for, or used in lieu of, competent legal advice
from counsel.<a name="N_12_"></a> 

<p>12. <u>See</u> note 5.<a name="N_13_"></a> 

<p>13. Corporate integrity agreements are executed as part of a civil settlement agreement between
the health care provider or entity responsible for billing for the provider and the Government to
resolve a case based on allegations of health care fraud or abuse.  These OIG-imposed programs
are in effect for a period of three to five years and require many of the elements included in this
compliance guidance.<a name="N_14_"></a> 

<p>14. Formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of directors, where applicable.  A
formal commitment does include the allocation of adequate resources to ensure that each of the
elements is addressed.<a name="N_15_"></a> 

<p>15. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, comment.
(n.3(k)).  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and practices for the Federal
criminal justice system that prescribe appropriate sanctions for offenders convicted of Federal
crimes.<a name="N_16_"></a> 

<p>16. The integral functions of a compliance officer and a corporate compliance committee in
implementing an effective compliance program are discussed throughout this compliance
guidance.  However, the OIG recognizes that the differences in the sizes and structures of billing
companies will result in differences in the ways in which compliance programs are set up.  The
important thing is that the billing company structures its compliance program in such a way that
the program is able to accomplish the key functions of a corporate compliance officer and a
corporate compliance committee discussed within this document.<a name="N_17_"></a> 

<p>17. Training and education programs for billing companies should be detailed and
comprehensive.  They should cover specific billing and coding procedures, as well as the general
areas of compliance.<a name="N_18_"></a> 

<p>18. For example, spot-checking the work of coding and billing personnel periodically should be
an element of an effective compliance program.  Identification of risk areas, discussed in further
detail in section II.A.2, is the first step in correcting aberrant billing patterns.<a name="N_19_"></a> 

<p>19. According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization must have established
compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other agents in order
to receive sentencing credit for an "effective" compliance program.  The Federal Sentencing
Guidelines define "agent" as "any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an
independent contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization."  <u>See</u> United States
Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(d).<a name="N_20_"></a> 

<p>20. The OIG strongly encourages high-level involvement by the billing company's governing
body, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, general counsel and chief financial officer,
in the development of standards of conduct.  Such involvement should help communicate a
strong and explicit organizational commitment to compliance goals and standards.<a name="N_21_"></a> 

<p>21. Billing company personnel should maintain an open dialogue with their providers regarding
documentation issues.  If the documentation received from a provider is ambiguous or
conflicting, the billing company should contact the provider for clarification or resolution.<a name="N_22_"></a> 

<p>22. <u>See</u> section II.A.2.b.<a name="N_23_"></a> 

<p>23. If the coding staff finds the physician's documentation to be unclear or conflicting, then they
should ask the physician for clarification.  This will frequently allow the coder to choose a more
appropriate code.  If the coder does not know how to code a particular type of bill for Medicare
payment, he or she should first consult with a supervisor.  If the question persists, the supervisor
should contact the provider's carrier/intermediary.  The billing company could also contact an
authoritative coding organization.  For example, the American Hospital Association maintains a
central office on ICD-9-CM.  All such correspondence should be maintained in a log.  In the rare
instance that the documentation appears to be for a new type of disease or syndrome, the
supervisor can send an inquiry to the National Center for Health Statistics, 6525 Belcrest Road,
Room 1100, Hyattsville, MD 20782.<a name="N_24_"></a> 

<p>24. For example, billing companies that provide marketing services should develop policies to
ensure compliance with the anti-kickback statute. &nbsp;42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b).  In addition, such
policies should provide that the billing company shall not submit or cause to be submitted to
health care programs claims for patients by virtue of a compensation agreement that was
designed to induce such referrals in violation of the anti-kickback statute, or similar Federal or
State statute or regulation.  Further, the policies and procedures should reference the OIG's safe
harbor regulations, clarifying those payment practices that would be immune from prosecution
under the anti-kickback statute.  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1001.952.<a name="N_25_"></a> 

<p>25. The OIG periodically issues Special Fraud Alerts setting forth activities believed to raise
legal and enforcement issues.  Billing company compliance programs should require the legal
staff, chief compliance officer or other appropriate personnel to carefully consider any and all
Special Fraud Alerts issued by the OIG that relate to health care providers to which they offer
services.  Moreover, the compliance programs should address the ramifications of failing to cease
and correct any conduct criticized in such a Special Fraud Alert, if applicable to billing
companies, or to take reasonable action to prevent such conduct from reoccurring in the future. 
If appropriate, billing companies should take the steps described in Section G regarding
investigations, reporting and correction of identified problems.<a name="N_26_"></a>

<p>26. The OIG's work plan is currently available on the Internet at <em>http://www.oig.hhs.gov</em>. 
  The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG intends to address in 
  the fiscal year. The Work Plan contains the projects of the Office of Audit 
  Services, Office of Evaluation and Inspections, Office of Investigations and 
  the Office of Counsel to the Inspector General. <a name="N_27_"></a> 
<p>27. Billing for items or services not actually documented involves submitting a claim that cannot
be substantiated in the documentation.<a name="N_28_"></a>

<p>28. "Unbundling" occurs when a billing entity uses separate billing codes for  services that have
an aggregate billing code.<a name="N_29_"></a>

<p>29. "Upcoding" reflects the practice of using a billing code that provides a higher reimbursement
rate than the billing code that actually reflects the service furnished to the patient.  Upcoding has
been a major focus of the OIG's law  enforcement efforts.  In fact, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 added another civil monetary penalty to the OIG's
sanction authorities for upcoding violations.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7a(a)(1)(A).<a name="N_30_"></a> 

<p>30. "DRG creep" is a variety of upcoding that involves the practice of billing using a Diagnosis
Related Group (DRG) code that provides a higher reimbursement rate than the DRG code that
accurately reflects patient's diagnosis.<a name="N_31_"></a> 

<p>31. Inappropriate balance billing refers to the practice of billing Medicare beneficiaries for the
difference between the total provider charges and the Medicare Part B allowable payment.<a name="N_32_"></a> 

<p>32. An overpayment is an improper or excessive payment made to a health care provider as a
result of patient billing or claims processing errors for which a refund is owed by the provider. 
Examples of Medicare overpayments include instances where a provider is:  (1) paid twice for
the same service either by Medicare or by Medicare and another insurer or beneficiary; or (2)
paid for services planned but not performed or for non-covered services.  Billing companies
should institute procedures to provide for timely and accurate reporting to both the provider and
the health care program of overpayments.<a name="N_33_"></a> 

<p>33. Because billing companies are in the business of processing health care information, it is
essential they develop policies and procedures to ensure the integrity of the information they
process and to ensure that records can be easily located and accessed within a well-organized
filing or alternative retrieval system.  All billing companies should have a back-up system
(whether by disk, tape or system) to ensure the integrity of data.  Policies should provide for a
regular system back-up to ensure that no information is lost.<a name="N_34_"></a> 

<p>34. All billing companies should develop, implement, audit and enforce policies and procedures
to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of financial, medical, personnel and other sensitive
information in their possession.  These policies should address both electronic and hard copy
documents.<a name="N_35_"></a> 

<p>35. Of particular concern, billing companies should be aware of the provisions of reassignment
of benefits.  These provisions govern who may receive payment due to a provider or supplier of
services or a beneficiary.  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.&#167;&#167; 424.70-424.80.  <u>See also</u> Medicare Carrier Manual    
&#167; 3060.10. <a name="N_36_"></a> 

<p>36. Billing companies that submit claims for non-physician outpatient services that were already
included in the hospital's inpatient payment under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) are in
effect submitting duplicate claims.<a name="N_37_"></a> 

<p>37. Duplicate billing occurs when the billing company submits more than one claim for the same
service or the bill is submitted to more than one primary payor at the same time.  Although
duplicate billing can occur due to simple error, knowing duplicate billing -- which is sometimes
evidenced by systematic or repeated double billing -- can create liability under criminal, civil or
administrative law, particularly if any overpayment is not promptly refunded.<a name="N_38_"></a> 

<p>38. Under the Medicare regulations, when a PPS hospital transfers a patient to another PPS
hospital, only the hospital to which the patient was transferred may charge the full DRG; the
transferring hospital should charge Medicare only a per diem amount.  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 412.4.<a name="N_39_"></a> 

<p>39. A modifier, as defined by the CPT-4 manual, provides the means by which the reporting
position (or provider) can indicate a service or procedure that has been performed has been
altered by some specific circumstance, but not changed in its definition or code.  Assuming the
modifier is used correctly and appropriately, this specificity provides the justification for 
payment for these services.  For correct use of modifiers, the billing company should reference
the appropriate sections of the Medicare carrier manual.  For general information on the correct
use of modifiers, the billing personnel should also reference the Correct Coding Initiative.  <u>See</u>
Medicare Carrier Manual &#167; 4630.<a name="N_40_"></a> 

<p>40. For billing companies that provide marketing services, percentage arrangements may
implicate the anti-kickback statute.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b) and 59 Fed. Reg. 65372
(12/19/94).  <u>Cf.</u> OIG Ad. Op. 98-10 (1998).  The OIG has a longstanding concern that percentage
billing arrangements may increase the risk of upcoding and similar abusive billing practices. 
<u>See, e.g.,</u> OIG Ad. Op. 98-1 (1998) and OIG Ad. Op. 98-4 (1998).<a name="N_41_"></a> 

<p>41.<sup> </sup>The OIG is troubled by the proliferation of business arrangements that may violate the
anti-kickback statute.  Such arrangements are generally established between those in a position to
refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which a Federal
health care program pays.  Sometimes established as "joint ventures," these arrangements may
take a variety of forms.  The OIG currently has a number of investigations and audits underway
that focus on such areas of concern.  Similarly, the billing company should not confer
gifts/entertainment upon the client-provider as this could also implicate the anti-kickback statute.

<p>42. Billing companies should encourage providers to make a good faith effort to collect
copayments, deductibles and non-covered services from federally and privately-insured patients. 
Billing "insurance only" may violate the False Claims Act, the anti-kickback statute, the Civil
Monetary Penalties Law, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7a(a)5, <em>as amended by</em> Pub. L. No. 104-91 &#167; 231(h),
and State laws.  For additional information on this problem, the OIG has published a Special
Fraud Alert on the routine waiver of copayments or deductibles under Medicare Part B.  <u>See</u> 59
Fed. Reg. 65,373 (12/19/94).<a name="N_43_"></a> 

<p>43. Discounts and professional courtesy may not be appropriate unless the total fee is discounted
or reduced.  In such situations, the payor <u>(eg.</u>, Medicare, Medicaid or any other private payor)
should receive its proportional share of the discount or reduction.<a name="N_44_"></a> 

<p>44. "Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an organization has previously committed
casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable steps to prevent such misconduct" and is a
significant factor in the assessment of whether a compliance program is effective.  <u>See</u> United
States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(7)(ii).
<a name="N_45_"></a> 

<p>45. The following risk areas are in no way a comprehensive list of risk areas for health care
providers.  They are merely a suggested list of documentation risks.  They do not address the
additional risk areas that apply to health care providers (<u>e.g.</u>, medical necessity issues).<a name="N_46_"></a> 

<p>46. The official coding guidelines are promulgated by the Health Care Financing 
  Administration, the National Center for Health Statistics, the American Medical 
  Association and the American Health Information Management Association. <u>See</u> 
  International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup>Revision, Clinical Modification 
  (ICD-9 CM)(and its successors); 1998 Health Care Financing Administration Common 
  Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) (and its successors); and Physicians' Current 
  Procedural Terminology (CPT). In addition, there are specialized coding systems 
  for specific segments of the health care industry. Among these are ADA (for 
  dental procedures), DSM IV (psychiatric health benefits) and DMERCs (for durable 
  medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies.)<a name="N_47_"></a> 
<p>47. The failure of a provider to:  (i) document items and services rendered; and (ii) properly
submit them for reimbursement is a major area of potential fraud and abuse in Federal health care
programs.  The OIG has undertaken numerous audits, investigations, inspections and national
enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing potential and actual fraud, abuse and waste in these
areas.<a name="N_48_"></a> 

<p>48. Internal coding practices, including software edits, should be reviewed periodically to
determine consistency with all applicable Federal, State and private payor health care program
requirements.<a name="N_49_"></a> 

<p>49. This refers to the coding of a diagnosis or procedure without supporting clinical
documentation.  Coding personnel must be aware of the need for documented verification of
services from the attending physician.<a name="N_50_"></a> 

<p>50. While proper documentation is the responsibility of the health care provider, the coder should
be aware of proper documentation requirements and should encourage providers to document
their services appropriately.  Depending on the circumstances, proper documentation can include: 

<p>(1) The reason for the patient encounter;

<p>(2) An appropriate history and evaluation;

<p>(3) Documentation of all services;

<p>(4) Documentation of reasons for the services;

<p>(5) An ongoing assessment of the patient's condition;

<p>(6) Information on the patient's progress and treatment outcome;

<p>(7) A documented treatment plan;

<p>(8) A plan of care, including treatments, medications (including dosage and  frequency), referrals
and consultations, patient and family education, and follow-up care;

<p>(9) Changes in treatment plan;

<p>(10) Documentation of medical rationale for the services rendered;

<p>(11) Documentation that supports the standards of medical necessity, <u>e.g.</u>,  certificates of medical
necessity for DMEPOS and home health services;

<p>(12) Abnormal test results addressed in the physician's documentation;

<p>(13) Identification of relevant health risk factors;

<p>(14) Documentation that meets the E &amp; M codes billed;

<p>(15) Medical records that are dated and authenticated; and/or

<p>(16) Prescriptions.

<p>Billing companies should also reference the <em>Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and
Management (E/M) Services</em>, published by the Health Care Financing Administration.  These
guidelines are available on the Internet at <em>http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mcarpti.htm.</em><a name="N_51_"></a> 

<p>51. Billing companies should ensure that they do not employ or contract with individuals that
have been sanctioned by the OIG or barred from Federal procurement programs.  The
Cumulative Sanction Report is available on the Internet at <em>http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig</em>.  In
addition, the General Services Administration maintains a monthly listing of debarred
contractors on the Internet at <em>http://epls.arnet.gov/</em>.<a name="N_52_"></a> 

<p>52. Examples of reference resources necessary for proper coding include:  a medical dictionary;
an anatomy/physiology textbook; up-to-date ICD, HCPCS and CPT code books; Physician's
Desk Reference; Merck Manual; the applicable contractor's provider manual; and subscriptions
to the American Hospital Association's <em>Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM</em> (and its successors) and the
American Medical Association's <em>CPT Assistant</em>.<a name="N_53_"></a> 

<p>53. <u>See</u> OIG Ad. Op. 98-1 (1998) and OIG Ad. Op. 98-4 (1998).  <u>See also</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 424.73.<a name="N_54_"></a> 

<p>54. The OIG recommends that, at a minimum, a valid statistical sample of claims be reviewed
annually both before and after billing is submitted.  This review should be done by a qualified
expert in the applicable coding process.<a name="N_55_"></a> 

<p>55. The billing company should also refer to State escheat laws for the specific requirements
relating to notifications, time periods and payment of any unclaimed funds.<a name="N_56_"></a> 

<p>56. This should include notifications regarding:  inappropriate claims; overpayments; and
termination of the contract.<a name="N_57_"></a> 

<p>57. If the billing company chooses to outsource the compliance function, the OIG recommends
the billing company engage an individual with significant experience in the billing and coding
industries.  Multiple small billing and coding facilities may contract with an individual to
job-share the individual's time and expertise in the area of compliance.<a name="N_58_"></a> 

<p>58. The OIG believes that it is not advisable for the compliance function to be subordinate to the
billing company's general counsel, or comptroller or similar billing company financial officer. 
Free standing compliance functions help to ensure independent and objective legal reviews and
financial analyses of the institution's compliance efforts and activities.  By separating the
compliance function from the key management positions of general counsel or chief financial
officer (where the size and structure of the billing company make this a feasible option), a system
of checks and balances is established to more effectively achieve the goals of the compliance
program.<a name="N_59_"></a> 

<p>59. For multi-site billing companies, the OIG encourages coordination with each billing facility
owned by the billing company through the use of a corporate compliance officer.<a name="N_60_"></a> 

<p>60.<a name="N_61_"> </a> <u>See</u> note 51.

<p>61. Periodic on-site visits of the billing company's operations, bulletins with compliance updates
and reminders, distribution of audiotapes or videotapes on different risk areas, lectures at
management and employee meetings, circulation of recent health care articles covering fraud and
abuse, and innovative changes to compliance training are various examples of approaches and
techniques the compliance officer can employ for the purpose of ensuring continued interest in
the compliance program and the billing company's commitment to its principles and policies.<a name="N_62_"></a> 

<p>62. The OIG recognizes that smaller billing companies may not be able to establish a compliance
committee.  In those situations, the compliance officer should fulfill the responsibilities of the
compliance committee.<a name="N_63_"></a> 

<p>63. The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals with varying
responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, finance, audit, human resources,
utilization review, medicine, coding and legal, as well as employees and managers of key
operating units.  These individuals should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive
experience within their respective departments to implement any necessary changes in the
company's policies and procedures.<a name="N_64_"></a> 

<p>64. A billing company should expect its compliance committee members and compliance officer
to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness and an approachable demeanor,
while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the billing company.  The compliance
committee members should also have significant professional experience in working with billing,
coding, clinical records and auditing principles.<a name="N_65_"></a> 

<p>65. This includes, but is not limited to, the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.   &#167;&#167; 3729-3733, the
criminal false claims statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 287, 1001, the fraud and abuse provisions of the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33 and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-191.<a name="N_66_"></a> 

<p>66. For billing companies, this includes developing and fostering excellent coordination and
communication with its provider clients.<a name="N_67_"></a> 

<p>67. Some publications, such as Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection reports, and advisory
opinions, as well as the annual OIG work plan, are readily available from the OIG and could be
the basis for standards, educational courses and programs for appropriate billing employees.<a name="N_68_"></a> 

<p>68. Significant variations in functions and responsibilities of different departments or groups may
create the need for training materials that are tailored to the compliance concerns associated with
particular operations and duties.<a name="N_69_"></a> 

<p>69. Certain positions, such as those involving the coding of medical services, create a greater
organizational legal exposure, and therefore require specialized training.  Billing companies
should fill such positions with individuals who have the appropriate educational background,
training and credentials.<a name="N_70_"></a> 

<p>70. Where the billing company has a culturally diverse employee base, the standards of conduct
should be translated into other languages and written at appropriate reading levels.<a name="N_71_"></a> 

<p>71.<sup> </sup>The OIG recognizes that not all standards, policies and procedures need to be communicated
to all employees.  However, the OIG believes that the bulk of the standards that relate to
complying with fraud and abuse laws and other ethical areas should be addressed and made part
of all employees' training.  The billing company should determine what additional training to
provide categories of employees based upon their job responsibilities.<a name="N_72_"></a> 

<p>72. Government, in this context, includes the appropriate Medicare carrier or intermediary.<a name="N_73_"></a> 

<p>73. In addition, where feasible, the OIG recommends that a billing company afford outside
contractors and its provider clients the opportunity to participate in the billing company's
compliance training and educational programs, or develop their own programs that complement
the billing company's standards of conduct, compliance requirements and other rules and
practices.<a name="N_74_"></a> 

<p>74. Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of corporate integrity agreements that
require many of these training elements.  The OIG usually requires a minimum of one to three
hours annually for basic training in compliance areas.  Additional training is required for
specialty fields such as billing, coding and marketing.<a name="N_75_"></a> 

<p>75. Appropriate coding and billing depends upon the quality and completeness of documentation. 
Therefore, the OIG believes that the billing company must foster an environment where
interactive communication is encouraged.  Health care providers should be reminded that
thorough, precise and timely documentation of services provided serves the interests of the
patient, the interest of the provider, as well as the interests of the billing company.<a name="N_76_"></a> 

<p>76. Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and employee
comprehension of the billing company's policies and procedures.<a name="N_77_"></a> 

<p>77.<sup> </sup>The OIG believes that whistle blowers should be protected against retaliation, a concept
embodied in the provisions of the False Claims Act.  <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h).  In many cases,
employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u> <u>tam</u> provisions out of frustration
because of the company's failure to take action when a questionable, fraudulent or abusive
situation was brought to the attention of senior corporate officials.<a name="N_78_"></a> 

<p>78. The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a small billing company to
maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls solely on compliance issues.  These
companies may explore alternative methods, such as contracting with an independent source to
provide hotline services or establishing a written method of confidential disclosure.<a name="N_79_"></a> 

<p>79. In addition to methods of communication used by current employees, an effective employee
exit interview program could be designed to solicit information from departing employees
regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations of the billing company's policy and
procedures.<a name="N_80_"></a> 

<p>80. Billing companies should also post in a prominent, available area the HHS-OIG Hotline
telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (HHS-TIPS), in addition to any company hotline number that
may be posted.<a name="N_81_"></a> 

<p>81. To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the billing company should create an
intake form for all compliance issues identified through reporting mechanisms.  The form could
include information concerning the date the potential problem was reported, the internal
investigative methods utilized, the results of any investigation, any corrective action
implemented, any disciplinary measures imposed and any overpayments and monies returned.<a name="N_82_"></a> 

<p>82. Information obtained over the hotline may provide valuable insight into management
practices and operations, whether reported problems are actual or perceived.<a name="N_83_"></a> 

<p>83. <u>See</u> note 51.  Likewise, billing company compliance programs should establish standards
prohibiting the execution of contracts with companies that have been recently convicted of a
criminal offense related to health care or that are listed by a Federal agency as debarred, excluded
or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs.<a name="N_84_"></a> 

<p>84. Prospective employees who have been officially reinstated into the Medicare and Medicaid
programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof of such reinstatement.<a name="N_85_"></a> 

<p>85. Even when a facility is owned by a larger corporate entity, the regular auditing and
monitoring of the compliance activities of an individual facility must be a key feature in any
annual review.  Appropriate reports on audit findings should be periodically provided and
explained to a parent-organization's senior staff and officers.<a name="N_86_"></a> 

<p>86. <u>See</u> section II.A.2.<a name="N_87_"></a> 

<p>87. The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a billing company,
the compliance officer, with the assistance of department managers, take a "snapshot" of the
company's operations from a compliance perspective.  This assessment can be undertaken by
outside consultants, law or accounting firms, or internal staff, with authoritative knowledge of
health care compliance requirements.  This "snapshot," often used as part of bench marking
analysis, becomes a baseline for the compliance officer and other managers to judge the billing
company's progress in reducing or eliminating potential areas of vulnerability.  For example, it
has been suggested that a baseline level include the frequency and percentile levels of CPT and
HCPCS codes.  Similarly, billing companies should track statistical data on claim rejection by
code.  This will facilitate identification of problem areas and elimination of potential areas of
abusive or fraudulent conduct.<a name="N_88_"></a> 

<p>88. Prompt steps to correct the problem include contacting the appropriate provider in situations
where the provider's actions contributed to the problem.<a name="N_89_"></a> 

<p>89. In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section G.2, below, reports of fraud or
systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate governmental authority.<a name="N_90_"></a> 

<p>90. One way to assess the knowledge, awareness and perceptions of the billing company staff is
through the use of a validated survey instrument (<u>e.g.</u>, employee questionnaires, interviews or
focus groups).<a name="N_91_"></a> 

<p>91. The OIG recognizes that billing companies that are small in size and have limited resources
may not be able to use internal reviewers who are not part of line management or hire outside
reviewers.<a name="N_92_"></a> 

<p>92. These evaluative reports should include a valid statistical sample of claims  submitted to
Federal health care programs.<a name="N_93_"></a> 

<p>93. Instances of non-compliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  The existence, or
amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely determinative of whether or not
the conduct should be investigated and reported to governmental authorities.  In fact, there may
be instances where there is no readily identifiable monetary loss at all, but corrective action and
reporting are still necessary to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its
beneficiaries.<a name="N_94_"></a> 

<p>94. Advice from the billing company's in-house counsel or an outside law firm 
  may be sought to determine the extent of the billing company's liability and 
  to plan the appropriate course of action. <a name="N_95_"></a> 
<p>95. The OIG currently maintains a provider self-disclosure protocol that encourages providers to
report suspected fraud.  The concept of self-disclosure is premised on a recognition that the
Government alone cannot protect the integrity of the Medicare and other Federal health care
programs.  Health care providers must be willing to police themselves, correct underlying
problems and work with the Government to resolve these matters.  The self-disclosure protocol
can be located on the OIG's website at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig.<a name="N_96_"></a> 

<p>96. The parameters of a claim review subject to an internal investigation will depend on the
circumstances surrounding the issue(s) identified.  By limiting the scope of the internal audit to
current billing, a billing company may fail to identify major problems and deficiencies in
operations, as well as be subject to certain liability. <a name="N_97_"></a> 

<p>97. When making the determination of credible misconduct, the billing company should consider
18 U.S.C. &#167; 669 [holding an individual(s) criminally liable for knowingly and willfully
embezzling, stealing or otherwise converting to the use of any person other than the rightful
owner or intentionally misapplying any of the monies, funds . . . premiums, credits, property or
assets of a health care benefit program] and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 [establishing criminal liability for an
individual(s) who commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,
commands, induces or procures its commission as punishable as the principle].<a name="N_98_"></a> 

<p>98. Appropriate Federal and/or State authorities include the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Criminal and Civil Divisions of the Department
of Justice, the U.S. Attorneys in the relevant districts, and the other investigative arms for
agencies administering the affected Federal or State health care programs, such as the State
Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Labor (which has primary
criminal jurisdiction over FECA, Black Lung and Longshore programs) and the Office of
Inspector General, U.S. Office of Personnel Management (which has primary jurisdiction over
the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program).<a name="N_99_"></a> 

<p>99. The OIG has published criteria setting forth those factors that the OIG takes into
consideration in determining whether it is appropriate to exclude a health care provider from
program participation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7(b)(7) for violations of various fraud and
abuse laws.  <u>See</u> 62 Fed. Reg. 67,392 (12/24/97).<a name="N_100_"></a> 

<p>100. Misconduct does not include inadvertent errors or mistakes.  Such errors should be reported
through the normal channels with the applicable carrier, intermediary or other HCFA-designated
payor.<a name="N_101_"></a> 

<p>101. Such conduct may include patterns of misconduct, particularly with regard to conduct that
had previously been identified by the billing company or carrier as suspect.<a name="N_102_"></a> 

<p>102. <u>See</u> note 98.<a name="N_103_"></a> 

<p>103. As a result of the limitations on reassignment, billing companies rarely engage in receiving
payment on behalf of their provider clients or negotiating checks on behalf of their provider
clients.  Because of these provisions, the OIG recognizes that billing companies are rarely in the
position to make restitution on behalf of their clients and it is generally viewed as the provider's
responsibility to make restitution to the appropriate payor.  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 424.73.<a name="N_104_"></a> 

<p>104. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(a)(3).<a name="N_105_"></a> 

<p>105. If a billing company needs further guidance to inform its provider clients 
  of normal repayment channels, the company should consult with the applicable 
  Medicare intermediary/carrier. The applicable Medicare intermediary/carrier 
  may require certain information (<u>e.g.,</u> alleged violation or issue causing 
  overpayment, description of overpayment, description of the internal investigative 
  process with methodologies used to determine any overpayments, disciplinary 
  actions taken and corrective actions taken) to be submitted with return of any 
  overpayments, and that such repayment information be submitted to a specific 
  department or individual in the carrier or intermediary's organization. Interest 
  will be assessed, when appropriate. &nbsp;<u>See</u> 42 C.F.R.&#167; 405.376.
