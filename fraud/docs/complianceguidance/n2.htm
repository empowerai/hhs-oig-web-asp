<strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>

<p>The creation of compliance program guidance is a major initiative of the OIG in its
effort to engage the private health care community in combating fraud and abuse. In the
last several years, the OIG has developed and issued compliance program guidance directed
at the following segments of the health care industry: the hospital industry; home health
agencies; clinical laboratories; third-party medical billing companies; the durable
medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supply industry; and hospices. The
development of these types of compliance program guidance is based on our belief that a
health care provider can use internal controls to more efficiently monitor adherence to
applicable statutes, regulations and program requirements. </p>

<p>Copies of these compliance program guidances can be found on the OIG web site at
http://www.oig.hhs.gov. </p>

<p><strong>Developing Draft Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities</strong> </p>

<p>On December 18, 1998, the OIG published a solicitation notice seeking information and
recommendations for developing formal guidance for nursing facilities (63 FR 70137). In
response to that solicitation notice, the OIG received 16 comments from various outside
sources. In developing this notice for formal public comment, we have considered those
comments, as well as previous OIG publications, such as other compliance program guidances
and Special Fraud Alerts. In addition, we have also taken into account past and recent
fraud investigations conducted by the OIG's Office of Investigations and the Department of
Justice, and have consulted with the Health Care Financing Administration. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
This draft guidance for nursing facilities contains seven elements that the OIG has
determined are fundamental to an effective compliance program: </p>

<p>implementing written policies; </p>

<p>designating a compliance officer and compliance committee; </p>

<p>conducting effective training and education; </p>

<p>developing effective lines of communication; </p>

<p>conducting internal monitoring and auditing; </p>

<p>enforcing standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines; and </p>

<p>responding promptly to detected offenses and developing corrective action. </p>

<p>These elements are contained in previous guidances issued by the OIG. As with
previously-issued guidances, this draft compliance program guidance represents the OIG's
suggestions on how nursing facilities can best establish internal controls and prevent
fraudulent activities. The contents of this guidance should not be viewed as mandatory or
as an exclusive discussion of the advisable elements of a compliance program; the document
is intended to present voluntary guidance to the industry and not represent binding
standards for nursing facilities. </p>

<p><strong>Public Input and Comment in Developing Final Guidance</strong> </p>

<p>In an effort to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to provide input into the
OIG's guidance, we are publishing this guidance in draft form. We welcome any comments
from interested parties regarding this document. The OIG will consider all comments that
are received within the above-cited time frame, incorporate any specific recommendations
as appropriate, and prepare a final version of the guidance thereafter for publication in
the <u>Federal Register</u>.<strong> </strong><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>Draft Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities</strong> </p>

<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>

<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) continues in its efforts to promote voluntarily implemented compliance programs for
the health care industry.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> This compliance guidance is
intended to assist nursing facilities<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> develop and
implement internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to applicable statutes
and regulations of the Federal health care programs<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and
private insurance program requirements. Compliance programs strengthen Government efforts
to prevent and reduce fraud and abuse, as well as further the mission of all nursing
facilities to provide quality care to their residents. </p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG provides its views on the fundamental elements of
nursing facility compliance programs, as well as the principles that each nursing facility
should consider when developing and implementing an effective compliance program. While
this document presents basic procedural and structural guidance for designing a compliance
program, it is not in and of itself a compliance program. Rather, it is a set of
guidelines that nursing facilities should consider when developing and implementing a
compliance program. </p>

<p>Implementing an effective compliance program in a nursing facility may require a
significant commitment of time and resources by all parts of the organization. However,
superficial efforts or programs that are hastily constructed and implemented without a
long-term commitment to a culture of compliance will likely be ineffective and may expose
the nursing facility to greater liability than if it had no program at all.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>
Although an effective compliance program may require a reallocation of existing resources,
the long term benefits of establishing a compliance program significantly outweigh the
initial costs. In short, compliance measures are an investment that advances the goals of
the nursing facility, the solvency of the Federal health care programs, and the quality of
care provided to the nursing home resident. </p>

<p>In a continuing effort to collaborate closely with health care providers and the
private sector, the OIG placed a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> soliciting comments
and recommendations on what should be included in this compliance program guidance.<a
href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> In addition to considering these comments in drafting this
guidance, we reviewed previous OIG publications, including OIG Special Fraud Alerts and
OIG Medicare Advisory Bulletins, as well as reports issued by OIG's Office of Audit
Services (OAS) and Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI) affecting the nursing home
industry. <a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> In addition, we relied on the experience
gained from fraud investigations of nursing home operators conducted by OIG's Office of
Investigations, the Department of Justice, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Units. </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>Benefits of a Compliance Program</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes a comprehensive compliance program provides a mechanism that brings
the public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse,
improving operational functions, improving the quality of health care services, and
reducing the cost of health care. Attaining these goals provides positive results to the
nursing facility, the Government, and individual citizens alike. In addition to fulfilling
its legal duty to ensure that it is not submitting false or inaccurate claims to
Government and private payers, a nursing facility may gain numerous additional benefits by
voluntarily implementing a compliance program. The benefits may include: 

<ol>
  <li>the formulation of effective internal controls to assure compliance with statutes,
    regulations and rules;</li>
  <li>a concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the nursing
    facility's commitment to responsible corporate conduct;</li>
  <li>the ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior;</li>
  <li>an increased likelihood of identifying and preventing unlawful and unethical behavior;</li>
  <li>the ability to quickly react to employees' operational compliance concerns and
    effectively target resources to address those concerns;</li>
  <li>improvement of the quality, efficiency, and consistency of providing services;</li>
  <li>a mechanism to encourage employees to report potential problems and allow for
    appropriate internal inquiry and corrective action; </li>
  <li>a centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes, regulations
    and other program directives;<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a></li>
  <li>a mechanism to improve internal communications;</li>
  <li>procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of alleged misconduct; and</li>
  <li>through early detection and reporting, minimizing loss to the Government from false
    claims, and thereby reducing the nursing facility's exposure to civil damages and
    penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the implementation of a compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud and abuse from the operations of a nursing facility. However, a sincere
effort by the nursing facility to comply with applicable statutes and regulations as well
as Government and private payer health care program requirements, through the
establishment of a compliance program, significantly reduces the risk of unlawful or
improper conduct. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>Application of Compliance Program Guidance</u></strong> </p>

<p>Given the diversity within the long term care industry, there is no single
&quot;best&quot; nursing facility compliance program. The OIG recognizes the complexities
of this industry and is sensitive to the differences among large national chains, regional
multi-facility operators, and small independent homes. However, the elements of this
guidance can be used by all nursing facilities to establish a compliance program,
regardless of size (in terms of employees and gross revenue), number of locations, or
corporate structure. Similarly, a corporation that provides long term care as part of an
integrated health care delivery system may incorporate these elements into its structure.<a
href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> </p>

<p>We recognize that some nursing facilities may not be able to adopt certain elements to
the same degree that others with more extensive resources may achieve. At the end of
several sections of this document, the OIG has offered suggestions to assist these smaller
nursing facility providers in implementing the principles expressed in this guidance.
Regardless of size, structure or available resources, the OIG recommends that every
nursing facility should strive to accomplish the objectives and principles underlying all
of the compliance polices and procedures in this guidance. </p>

<p>By no means should the contents of this guidance be viewed as an exclusive or complete
discussion of the advisable elements of a compliance program. On the contrary, the OIG
strongly encourages nursing facilities to develop and implement compliance elements that
uniquely address the areas of potential problems, common concerns, or high risk areas that
apply to their own facilities. Furthermore, this guidance may be modified and expanded as
more information and knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the statutes,
regulations and rules of the Federal, State, and private health plans occur. New
compliance practices also may be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG discovers
enhancements that promote effective compliance. </p>

<p><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong> </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>The Seven Basic Compliance Elements</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes that every effective compliance program must begin with a formal
commitment<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> by the nursing facility's governing body to
address <u>all</u> of the applicable elements listed below, which are based on the seven
steps of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> The OIG
recognizes that full implementation of all elements may not be immediately feasible for
all nursing facilities. However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful commitment
on the part of nursing facility management will substantially contribute to the program's
successful implementation. As the compliance program is effectuated, that commitment
should cascade down through management to every employee and contractor of the nursing
facility. </p>

<p>At a minimum, a comprehensive compliance program should include the following seven
elements: </p>

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as
written policies, procedures and protocols that promote the nursing facility's commitment
to compliance (<u>e.g.</u>, by including adherence to the compliance program as an element
in evaluating managers and employees) and address specific areas of potential fraud and
abuse, such as claims development and submission processes, quality of care issues facing
residents, and financial arrangements with physicians and outside contractors that may
affect the health care provided to beneficiaries; </p>

<p>(2) The designation of a compliance officer and other appropriate bodies (<u>e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee), charged with the responsibility for developing,
operating and monitoring the compliance program, and who reports directly to the owner(s),
governing body and/or CEO;<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training
programs for all affected employees;<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(4) The creation and maintenance of an effective line of communication between the
compliance officer and all employees, including a process, such as a hotline or other
reporting system, to receive complaints, and the adoption of procedures to protect the
anonymity of complainants and to protect whistle blowers from retaliation; </p>

<p>(5) The use of audits and/or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance,
identify problem areas, and assist in the reduction of identified problems;<a
href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(6) The development of policies and procedures addressing the non-employment or
retention of excluded individuals or entities; and the enforcement of appropriate
disciplinary action against employees or contractors who have violated corporate or
compliance policies and procedures, applicable statutes, regulations, or Federal, State,
or private payor health care program requirements; and </p>

<p>(7) The development of policies and procedures with respect to the investigation of
identified systemic problems, which include direction regarding the prompt and proper
response to detected offenses, such as the initiation of appropriate corrective action,
repayments and preventive measures. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>Written Policies and Procedures</u></strong> </p>

<p>Every compliance program should develop and distribute written compliance standards,
procedures and practices that guide the nursing facility and the conduct of its employees
throughout day-to-day operations. These policies and procedures should be developed under
the direction and supervision of the compliance officer, the compliance committee, and
operational managers. At a minimum, they should be provided to all employees who are
affected by these policies, as well as physicians, suppliers, nursing facility agents, and
contractors who may affect or be affected by the nursing facility's billing and care
functions.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> In addition to general corporate policies
and procedures, an effective compliance program should include specific policies and
procedures for the different clinical, financial, and administrative functions of a
nursing facility. </p>

<p><strong>1. Code of Conduct</strong> </p>

<p>While a clear statement of policies and procedures is at the core of a compliance
program, the OIG recommends that nursing facilities start the process with the development
of a corporate statement of principles that will guide the operations of the provider. One
common expression of this statement of principles is the code of conduct.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
The code should function in the same fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a
foundational document that details the fundamental principles, values, and framework for
action within an organization. The code of conduct for a nursing facility should
articulate the organization's expectations of employees, as well as summarize the basic
legal principles under which the organization must operate. Unlike the more detailed
policies and procedures, the code of conduct should be brief, easily readable and cover
general principles applicable to all employees. </p>

<p>The code of conduct should be distributed to, and comprehensible by, all affected
employees.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> Depending on the facility's work force,
this may mean that the code should be translated into other languages when necessary and
written at appropriate reading levels. Further, any employee handbook delineating the
standards of conduct should be regularly updated to reflect developments in applicable
Government and private health care program requirements. Finally, the OIG recommends that
current employees, as well as those newly hired, should certify that they have received
and read the organization's code of conduct. These certifications should be updated on a
regular basis, possibly as part of an annual training program, retained in the employee's
personnel file and made available for review.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG believes that <u>all</u> nursing facilities should operate under the guidance
of a code of conduct. While the OIG recognizes that some nursing facilities may not have
the resources to establish a comprehensive compliance program, we believe that every
nursing facility can design a program that addresses the seven elements set out in this
guidance, albeit at different levels of sophistication and complexity. In its most
fundamental form, a facility's code of conduct is a basic set of standards that articulate
the organization's philosophy, summarizes basic legal principles, and teaches employees
how to respond to practices that may violate the code of conduct and standards. These
standards should be posted and distributed to every employee. Further, even a small
nursing facility should obtain written attestation from its employees to confirm their
understanding and commitment to the nursing facility's code of conduct. </p>

<p><strong>2. Specific Risk Areas</strong> </p>

<p>As part of their commitment to a compliance program, nursing facilities should prepare
a comprehensive set of written policies and procedures that are in place to prevent fraud
and abuse in facility operations and to ensure the appropriate care of their residents.
These policies and procedures should educate and alert all affected managers and employees
of the Federal health care program requirements, the consequences of noncompliance, and
the specific procedures that nursing facility employees should follow to report problems,
to ensure compliance, and to rectify any prior noncompliance. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that most facilities have in place policies and procedures to
prevent fraud and abuse in their institutions. These providers may not need to develop a
new, comprehensive set of policies as part of their compliance program if existing
policies encompass the provider's operations and relevant rules. However, the nursing home
industry is subject to numerous Federal and State statutes, rules, regulations and manual
instructions.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> Because these program requirements are
frequently modified, the OIG recommends that all nursing facilities evaluate their current
compliance policies and procedures by conducting a baseline assessment of risk areas, as
well as subsequent reevaluations.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> The OIG also
recommends that these internal compliance reviews be undertaken on a regular basis to
ensure compliance with current program requirements. </p>

<p>To assist nursing facilities in performing this internal assessment, the OIG has
developed a list of potential risk areas affecting nursing facility providers. These risk
areas include quality of care and residents' rights, employee screening, vendor
relationships, billing and cost reporting, and record keeping and documentation. This list
of risk areas is not exhaustive, nor all encompassing. Rather, it should be viewed as a
starting point for an internal review of potential vulnerabilities within the nursing
facility.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> The objective of this assessment should be
to ensure that the employees, managers and directors are aware of these risk areas and
that steps are taken to minimize, to the extent possible, the types of billing and quality
of care problems identified. While there are many ways to accomplish this objective, the
OIG has observed that comprehensive, clear written standards, policies and procedures that
are communicated to all appropriate employees and contractors are the first step in an
effective compliance program. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that sound operating compliance policies are essential to all nursing
facilities, regardless of size and capability. If a lack of resources to develop such
policies is genuinely an issue, the OIG recommends that those nursing facilities focus
first on those risk areas most likely to arise in their business operations. At a <u>minimum</u>,
resources should be directed to analyze the results of annual surveys,<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
and to verify that the facility has effectively addressed any deficiencies cited by the
surveyors. An effective and low-cost means to accomplish this is through the use of the
facility's Quality Assessment and Assurance Committee. The committee should consist of
facility staff members, including the Director of Nursing and the facility physician. On a
periodic basis, the committee should meet to identify compliance issues affecting the
quality of care provided to the residents and to develop and implement appropriate
corrective actions. The time commitment required for this collaborative effort will vary
according to the magnitude of the facility's quality assessment and assurance issues. </p>

<p>Creating a resource manual from publically available information may be a
cost-effective approach for developing policies and procedures to improve the quality of
each resident's life. For example, a simple binder that contains a facility's written
policies and procedures, the most recent survey findings and plan of correction, relevant
HCFA instructions and bulletins, and summaries of key OIG documents (<u>e.g</u>., Special
Fraud Alerts, Advisory Bulletins, inspection and audit reports) can be regularly updated
and made accessible to all employees. Particularly in the case of more technical
materials, it may be advisable to provide summaries in the handbook and make the source
documents available upon request. If individualized copies of this handbook are not made
available to all employees, then a reference copy should be available in a readily
accessible location, as well as from the designated compliance officer. </p>

<p><strong>a. Quality of Care</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes that a nursing facility's compliance policies should start with a
statement that affirms the facility's commitment to providing the care necessary to attain
or maintain the resident's &quot;highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial
well-being.&quot;<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> To achieve the goal of providing
quality care, nursing facilities should continually measure their performance against
comprehensive standards, which at a minimum should include the Medicare conditions of
participation.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> In addition to these regulations, a
facility should develop its own standards of quality care and the mechanisms for
evaluating its performance. </p>

<p>As noted above, current and past surveys are a good place to begin to identify specific
risk areas and regulatory vulnerabilities at the individual facility. Any deficiencies
discovered by annual State agency or Federal validation surveys may reflect noncompliance
with the program regulations and can be the basis for enforcement actions.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
Those deficiencies identified by the State health agency survey instrument should be
addressed and, where appropriate, the corrective action should be incorporated into the
facility's policies and procedures as well as reflected in its training and educational
programs. In addition to responding promptly to deficiencies identified through the survey
and certification process, nursing facilities should take proactive measures to identify,
anticipate and respond to quality of care risk areas identified by the nursing home
ombudsman or other sources. </p>

<p>As noted throughout this guidance, each provider must assess its vulnerability to
particular abusive practices in light of its unique circumstances. However, the OIG, HCFA,
the Department of Justice, and State enforcement agencies have substantial experience in
identifying quality of care risk areas. Some of the special areas of concern include: </p>

<p>absence of a comprehensive, accurate assessment of each resident's functional capacity
and a comprehensive care plan that includes measurable objectives to meet the resident's
medical, mental and psychosocial needs;<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> </p>

<p>inappropriate or insufficient treatment and services to address residents' clinical
conditions, including pressure ulcers, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence of the
bladder, and mental or psychosocial problems;<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> </p>

<p>failure to properly prescribe, administer and monitor drug medication usage, including
psychotropic and anti-depressant medications;<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> </p>

<p>inadequate or insufficiently trained staff to provide medical, nursing, and related
services;<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> </p>

<p>failure to provide appropriate therapy services;<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> </p>

<p>failure to provide appropriate services to assist residents with activities of daily
living (<u>e.g.</u>, feeding, dressing, bathing, etc.); and <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
failure to report incidents of mistreatment, neglect, or abuse to the administrator of the
facility and other officials as required by law.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a> </p>

<p>As noted previously, a nursing facility that has a history of serious deficiencies
should use those survey results as a starting point for implementing a comprehensive plan
to improve its quality of care. Effectively addressing these risk areas with written
policies and procedures, which are then implemented through effective training programs,
can most directly improve the quality of the nursing home residents's life. </p>

<p><strong>b. Residents' Rights</strong> </p>

<p>The Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, Public Law 100-203, established a number
of requirements to protect and promote the rights of each resident.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
In addition, many States have adopted specific lists of residents' rights.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
The nursing facility's policies should address the residents' right to a dignified
existence that promotes freedom of choice, self-determination, and reasonable
accommodation of individual needs. To protect the rights of each resident, the OIG
recommends that a provider address the following risk areas as part of its compliance
policies: 

<ul>
  <li>discriminatory admission or improper denial of access to care;<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a></li>
  <li>verbal, mental or physical abuse, corporal punishment and involuntary seclusion;<a
    href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></li>
  <li>inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints;<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
  </li>
  <li>failure to ensure that residents have access to their personal records upon request and
    that the privacy and confidentiality of those records are protected;<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a></li>
  <li>denial of a resident's right to participate in his or her care and treatment; <a
    href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a></li>
  <li>failure to safeguard residents' financial affairs.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c. Billing and Cost Reporting</strong> </p>

<p>Abusive and fraudulent billing practices in the Federal health care programs drain the
public fisc of the funds needed to provide program beneficiaries medically necessary items
and services. Over the last twenty years, the OIG has identified patterns of improper and
fraudulent activities that cover the spectrum of health care services and have cost
taxpayers billions of dollars.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a> These fraudulent
billing practices, as well as abuses in other risk areas that are described in these
compliance program guidances, have resulted in criminal, civil and administrative
enforcement actions. Because the consequences of these enforcement actions can have a
profound adverse impact on a provider, the identification of risk areas associated with
billing and cost reporting should be a major part of a nursing facility's compliance
program. </p>

<p>The introduction of a prospective payments system (PPS) for Medicare SNFs and
implementation of consolidated billing create additional issues to be addressed when
designing billing and cost reporting compliance policies and procedures.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
In the following discussion of billing risk areas, the OIG has attempted to identify
issues that pose concerns under the current systems of reimbursement, the transition
period to consolidated billing, as well as anticipate potential compliance issues stemming
from these program changes. As is the case with all aspects of compliance, the nursing
facility must continually reassess its billing procedures and policies to ensure that
unanticipated problems are promptly identified and corrected. Listed below are some of the
reimbursement risk areas a nursing facility should consider addressing as part of its
written compliance policies and procedures: </p>

<p>billing for items or services not rendered or provided as claimed;<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>submitting claims for equipment, medical supplies and services that are medically
unnecessary;<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> </p>

<p>submitting claims to Medicare Part A for residents who are not eligible for Part A
coverage;<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> </p>

<p>duplicate billing;<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a> </p>

<p>failing to identify and refund credit balances;<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> </p>

<p>submitting claims for items or services not ordered;<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>knowingly billing for inadequate or substandard care;<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>providing misleading information about a resident's medical condition on the MDS or
otherwise providing inaccurate information used to determine the RUG assigned to the
resident; </p>

<p>upcoding the level of service provided;<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> </p>

<p>billing for individual items or services when they either are included in the
facility's per diem rate or are of the type of item or service that must be billed as a
unit and may not be unbundled; <a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> </p>

<p>billing residents for items or services that are included in the per diem rate or
otherwise covered by the third-party payor; </p>

<p>forging physician or beneficiary signatures on documents used to verify that services
were ordered and/or provided;<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> </p>

ordered and/or performed; and </p>

<p>false cost reports.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The OIG recommends that a nursing facility, through its policies and procedures, take all
reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the Federal health care programs when
submitting information that affects reimbursement decisions. The risk areas associated
with billing and cost reporting have been among the most frequent subjects of
investigations and audits by the OIG. In addition to facing criminal sanctions and
significant monetary penalties, providers that have failed to adequately ensure the
accuracy of their claims and cost report submissions can be excluded from program
participation, or in lieu of exclusion, be required by the OIG to execute a corporate
integrity agreement (CIA).<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>d. Employee Screening</strong> </p>

<p>Nursing facilities are required by Federal, and in some cases State, law to investigate
the background of certain employees. Nursing facilities should conduct a reasonable and
prudent background investigation and reference check before hiring those employees who
have access to patients or their possessions, or who have discretionary authority to make
decisions that may involve compliance with the law. The employment application should
specifically require the applicant to disclose any criminal conviction, as defined by 42
U.S.C. 1320a-7; or exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs. </p>

<p>This pre-employment screening is critical to ensuring the integrity of the facility's
work force and safeguarding the welfare of its residents. Because providers of nursing
care have frequent, relatively unsupervised access to vulnerable people and their
property, a nursing facility also should seriously consider whether to employ individuals
who have been convicted of crimes of neglect, violence, theft or dishonesty, or financial
misconduct.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Nursing facility policies should prohibit the continued employment of individuals who
have been convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are debarred,
excluded, or otherwise become ineligible for participation in Federal health care
programs.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> In addition, if the facility has notice that
an employee or contractor is charged with a criminal offense related to any Federal health
care program, or is proposed for exclusion during his or her employment or contract, the
facility shall take all appropriate actions to ensure that the responsibilities of that
employee or contractor do not adversely affect the quality of care rendered to any patient
or resident, or the accuracy of any claims submitted to any Federal health care program.<a
href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> If resolution of the matter results in conviction,
debarment, or exclusion, the nursing facility should terminate its employment or other
contract arrangement with the individual. </p>

<p>In order to ensure that nursing facilities undertake background checks of all employees
to the extent required by law, the OIG recommends that the following measures be
incorporated into the compliance program's policies and procedures: 

<ul>
  <li>investigate the background of employees by checking with all applicable licensing and
    certification authorities to verify that requisite licenses and certifications are in
    order;<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a></li>
  <li>require all potential employees to certify that they have not been convicted of an
    offense that would preclude employment in a nursing facility and that they are not
    excluded from participation in the Federal health care programs; </li>
  <li>check available public sources, including the OIG's List of Excluded
    Individuals/Entities and the GSA's list of debarred contractors, to verify that employees
    are not excluded from participating in the Federal health care programs; <a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
    and </li>
  <li>periodically check the OIG and GSA web sites to verify the participation/exclusion
    status of independent contractors and retain on file the results of that query.<a
    href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the size or resources of the nursing facility, employee screening is a
critical component of compliance policies and procedures. Nursing facilities, like all
corporations, must act through their employees and are held accountable for their actions.
One of the best ways to ensure that the organization will act in conformance with the law
is to hire employees and contractors who can be trusted to embrace a culture of
compliance. While the resources required to check the OIG List of Excluded
Individuals/Entities are minimal, the absence of an accessible centralized site for
criminal background checks may result in inefficiencies and expense. While large providers
may elect to outsource the screening process, this may not be a realistic option for
smaller nursing facilities. Nevertheless, the OIG recommends that all nursing facilities
implement a policy to undertake background checks of all employees. </p>

<p><strong>e. Kickbacks, Inducements and Self-Referrals</strong> </p>

<p>A nursing facility should have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the
anti-kickback statute,<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a> the Stark physician
self-referral law<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> and other relevant Federal and State
laws by providing guidance in situations that could lead to a violation of these laws.<a
href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> In particular, arrangements with hospitals, hospices,
physicians and vendors are vulnerable to abuse. For example, in the case of hospitals,
physicians and hospital staff exert influence over the patient and can influence the
choice of a nursing facility. In addition, his or her roles as medical director and/or
attending physician, a physician frequently can influence the utilization of ancillary
services.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> Moreover, by contrast, a nursing facility
operator can influence the selection of which hospices will provide hospice services and
which vendors will deliver equipment and services to the facility's residents. In addition
to developing policies to address arrangements with other health care providers and
suppliers, nursing facilities also should implement measures to avoid offering
inappropriate inducements to residents. Possible risk areas that should be addressed in
the policies and procedures include: </p>

<p>routinely waiving coinsurance or deductible amounts without a good faith determination
that the resident is in financial need, or absent reasonable efforts to collect the
cost-sharing amount;<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a> </p>

<p>agreements between the facility and a hospital, home health agency, or hospice that
involve the referral or transfer of any resident to or by the nursing home;<a
href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> </p>

<p>soliciting, accepting or offering any gift or gratuity of more than nominal value to or
from residents, potential referral sources, and other individuals and entities with which
the nursing facility has a business relationship;<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a> </p>

<p>conditioning admission or continued stay at a facility on a third-party guarantee of
payment, or soliciting payment for services covered by Medicaid, in addition to any amount
required to be paid under the State Medicaid plan;<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> </p>

<p>arrangements between a nursing facility and a hospital under which the facility will
only accept a Medicare beneficiary on the condition that the hospital pays the facility an
amount over and above what the facility would receive through PPS;<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>financial arrangements with physicians, including the facility's medical director;<a
href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a> </p>

<p>arrangements with vendors that result in the nursing facility receiving non-covered
items (such as disposable adult diapers) at below market prices or no charge, provided the
facility orders Medicare-reimbursed products;<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> </p>

<p>soliciting or receiving items of value in exchange for providing the supplier access to
residents' medical records and other information needed to bill Medicare;<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>joint ventures with entities supplying goods or services;<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
and </p>

<p>swapping.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In order to keep current with this area of the law, a nursing facility should obtain
copies of all relevant OIG and HCFA regulations, Special Fraud Alerts, and Advisory
Opinions that address the application of the anti-kickback and Stark self-referral laws to
ensure that the policies reflect current positions and opinions. Further, nursing facility
policies should provide that all nursing facility contracts and arrangements with actual
or potential sources of referrals are reviewed by counsel and comply with applicable
statutes and requirements. </p>

<p><strong>3. Retention of Records</strong> </p>

<p>Nursing facilities that implement a compliance program should provide for the
development and implementation of a records retention system. This system should establish
policies and procedures regarding the creation, distribution, retention, and destruction
of documents. In designing a records systems, privacy concerns and regulatory requirements
should be taken into consideration. In addition to maintaining appropriate and thorough
medical records on each resident, the OIG recommends that the system should include the
following types of documents: </p>

<p>all records and documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, billing and claims documentation) required
for participation in Federal State, and private health care programs, including the
resident assessment instrument, the comprehensive plan of care and all corrective actions
taken in response to surveys; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
all records and documentation required by private payors and other governmental
institutions; </p>

<p>all records, documentation, and audit data that support and explain cost reports and
other financial activity, including any internal or external compliance monitoring
activities; and </p>

<p>all records necessary to demonstrate the integrity of the nursing facility compliance
process and to confirm the effectiveness of the program.<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><a name="records"></a>While conducting its compliance activities, as well as its daily
operations, a nursing facility should document its efforts to comply with applicable
statutes, regulations, and Federal health care program requirements. For example, where a
nursing facility requests advice from a Government agency (including a Medicare fiscal
intermediary or carrier) charged with administering a Federal health care program, the
nursing facility should document and retain a record of the request and any written or
oral response. This step is extremely important if the nursing facility intends to rely on
that response to guide it in future decisions, actions, or claim reimbursement requests or
appeals. A log of oral inquiries between the nursing facility and third parties will help
the organization document its attempts at compliance. In addition, these records may
become relevant in a subsequent investigation to the issue of whether the facility's
reliance was &quot;reasonable&quot; and whether it exercised due diligence in developing
procedures and practices to implement the advice. </p>

<p>In short, all nursing facilities, regardless of size, must retain appropriate
documentation. Further, the OIG recommends that the nursing facility: </p>

<p>secure this information in a safe place; </p>

<p>maintain hard copies of all electronic or database documentation; and </p>

<p>limit access to such documentation to avoid accidental or intentional fabrication or
destruction of records.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> </p>

<p>As the Government increases its reliance on electronic data interchange to conduct
business and gather information more quickly and efficiently, it is important that the
nursing facility develops the capacity to ensure that all informational systems maintained
by the facility are in working order, secured, and capable of accessing Federal and State
databases. </p>

<p><strong>4. Compliance as an Element of Employee Performance</strong> </p>

<p>Compliance programs should require that the promotion of, and adherence to, the
elements of the compliance program be a factor in evaluating the performance of all
employees. Employees should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and
procedures. In addition, policies should require that managers, especially those involved
in the direct care of residents and in claims development and submission: </p>

<p>discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance policies
and legal requirements applicable to their function; </p>

<p>inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
procedures is a condition of employment; and </p>

<p>disclose to all supervised personnel that the nursing facility will take disciplinary
action up to and including termination for violation of these policies or requirements. </p>

<p>Managers and supervisors should be disciplined for failing to adequately instruct their
subordinates or for failing to detect noncompliance with applicable policies and legal
requirements, where reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of any problems
or violations and given the nursing facility the opportunity to correct them earlier.
Conversely, those supervisors who have demonstrated leadership in the advancement of the
company's code of conduct and compliance objectives should be singled out for recognition.
</p>

<p>The OIG believes that all nursing facilities, regardless of resources or size, should
ensure that its employees understand the importance of compliance with program
requirements and the value the company places on its compliance program. If the small
nursing facility does not have a formal employee evaluation system, it should informally
convey to employees their compliance responsibilities whenever the opportunity arises.
Positive reenforcement is generally more effective than sanctions in conditioning behavior
and managers should be given mechanisms to reward employees who promote compliance. </p>

<p><strong>C. <u>DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>Every nursing home provider should designate a compliance officer to serve as the focal
point for compliance activities. This responsibility may be the individual's sole duty or
added to other management responsibilities, depending upon the size and resources of the
nursing facility and the complexity of the task. Designating a compliance officer with the
appropriate authority is critical to the success of the program, necessitating the
appointment of a high-level official with direct access to the nursing facility's
president or CEO, governing body, all other senior management, and legal counsel.<a
href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a> The officer should have sufficient funding and staff to
perform his or her responsibilities fully. </p>

<p>Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance officer with
regard to planning, implementing, and monitoring the compliance program. </p>

<p>The compliance officer's primary responsibilities should include: 

<ul>
  <li>overseeing and monitoring implementation of the compliance program;<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>reporting on a regular basis to the nursing facility's governing body, CEO, and
    compliance committee (if applicable) on the progress of implementation, and assisting
    these components in establishing methods to improve the nursing facility's efficiency and
    quality of services, and to reduce the facility's vulnerability to fraud, abuse, and
    waste;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs, and
    in the law and policies of Government and private payor health plans;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>developing, coordinating, and participating in a multifaceted educational and training
    program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program, and seeking to ensure that
    all relevant employees and management understand and comply with pertinent Federal and
    State standards;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that independent contractors and agents who furnish physician, nursing, or
    other health care services to the residents of the nursing facility are aware of the
    requirements of the nursing facility's compliance program with respect to residents'
    rights, billing, and marketing, among other things;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>coordinating personnel issues with the nursing facility's Human Resources/Personnel
    office (or its equivalent) to ensure that (i) the National Practitioner Data Bank<a
    href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a> has been checked with respect to all medical staff and
    independent contractors (as appropriate) and (ii) the List of Excluded
    Individuals/Entities<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a> has been checked with respect to
    all employees, medical staff, and independent contractors;<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assisting the nursing facility's financial management in coordinating internal
    compliance review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of
    departments;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including the
    flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding to
    reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action (<u>e.g.</u>,
    making necessary improvements to nursing facility policies and practices, taking
    appropriate disciplinary action, etc.) with all nursing facility departments,
    subcontracted providers, and health care professionals under the nursing facility's
    control; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>participating with facility's counsel in the appropriate reporting of self-discovered
    violations of program requirements; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>continuing the momentum of the compliance program after the initial years of
    implementation.<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other
information that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to,
medical and billing records, and documents concerning the marketing efforts of the nursing
facility and its arrangements with other health care providers, including physicians and
independent contractors. This review authority enables the compliance officer to examine
contracts and obligations (seeking the advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that
may contain referral and payment provisions that could violate the anti-kickback statute
or regulatory requirements. </p>

<p>A small nursing facility may not have the resources to hire or appoint a full time
compliance officer. Multi-facility providers also may consider appointing one compliance
officer at the corporate level and creating compliance liaisons officers at each facility.
In any event, each facility should have a person in its organization (this person may have
other functional responsibilities) who can oversee the nursing facility's compliance with
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and policies. The structure and comprehensiveness
of the facility's compliance program will help determine the responsibilities of each
individual compliance officer. </p>

<p><strong>2. Compliance Committee</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that a compliance committee be established to advise the compliance
officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a>
When developing an appropriate team of people to serve as the nursing facility's
compliance committee, a facility should consider a variety of skills and personality
traits that are expected from those in such positions.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>
Once a nursing facility chooses the people that will accept the responsibilities vested in
members of the compliance committee, the nursing facility needs to train these individuals
on the policies and procedures of the compliance program, as well as how to discharge
their duties. </p>

<p>The committee's functions should include: 

<ul>
  <li>analyzing the legal requirements with which the nursing facility must comply, and
    specific risk areas;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assessing existing policies and procedures that address these risk areas for possible
    incorporation into the compliance program; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>working with appropriate departments to develop standards of conduct, and policies and
    procedures to promote compliance with legal and ethical requirements;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
    development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's policies; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>determining the appropriate strategies and approaches to promote compliance with program
    requirements and detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other
    fraud reporting mechanisms;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>developing a system to solicit, evaluate, and respond to complaints and problems; and </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
    identifying deficiencies, and implementing corrective action. </li>
</ul>

<p>The committee may also undertake other functions as the compliance concept becomes part
of the overall nursing facility operating structure and daily routine. The compliance
committee is an extension of the compliance officer and provides the organization with
increased oversight. The OIG recognizes that some nursing facilities may not have the
resources or the need to establish a compliance committee. However, when potential
problems are identified, the OIG recommends these nursing facilities create a &quot;task
force,&quot; to address the particular problem. The members of the task force may vary
depending upon the issue. For example, if problems are identified as a result of a State
or Federal survey, the OIG recommends that a task force be created to examine the
deficiencies identified by the survey and to develop plans of actions to correct the
underlying causes of the deficiency. </p>

<p><strong>D. <u>CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong> </p>

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers and health care
professionals, and the continual retraining of current personnel at all levels are
critical elements of an effective compliance program. These training programs should
include sessions summarizing the organization's compliance program, fraud and abuse laws
and Federal and private payor health care program requirements. More specific training on
issues such as claims development and submission processes, resident rights, and marketing
practices should be targeted at those employees and contractors whose job requirements
make the information relevant.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The organization must take steps to communicate effectively its standards and
procedures to all affected employees, physicians, independent contractors, and other
significant agents by requiring participation in such training programs and by other
means, such as disseminating publications that explain specific requirements in a
practical manner.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Managers of specific departments or groups can assist in identifying areas that require
training and in carrying out such training.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a> Training
instructors may come from outside or inside the organization, but must be qualified to
present the subject matter involved and sufficiently experienced in the issues presented
to adequately field questions and coordinate discussions among those being trained. </p>

<p>The nursing facility should train new employees soon after they have started working.<a
href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a> Training programs and materials should be designed to
take into account the skills, experience, and knowledge of the individual trainees. The
compliance officer should document any formal training undertaken by the nursing facility
as part of the compliance program. </p>

<p>A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training, and where a nursing
facility has a culturally diverse staff, training in different languages, should be
implemented so that all affected employees understand the institution's standards of
conduct and procedures for alerting senior management to problems and concerns.<a
href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In addition to specific training in the risk areas identified in section II.B.2,
primary training for appropriate corporate officers, managers, and facility staff should
include such topics as: 

<ul>
  <li>compliance with Medicare conditions of participation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>appropriate and sufficient documentation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>prohibitions on paying or receiving remuneration to induce referrals; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>improper alterations to clinical or financial records;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>resident rights; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>The OIG suggests that all relevant personnel participate in the various educational and
training programs of the nursing facility.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a> Employees
should be required to have a minimum number of educational hours per year, as appropriate,
as part of their employment responsibilities.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> For
example, for certain employees involved in the nursing facility admission functions,
periodic training in applicable reimbursement coverage and eligibility requirements should
be required. In nursing facilities with high employee turnover, periodic training updates
are critical. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the format of the training program will vary depending upon the
resources of the nursing facility. For example, a nursing facility with limited resources
may want to create a videotape for each type of training session so new employees can
receive training in a timely manner. If videos are used for compliance training, the OIG
suggests that a nursing facility make an individual available to field questions from
video trainees. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that participation in training programs be made a condition of
continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements should result
in disciplinary action, when such failure is serious. Adherence to the training
requirements as well as other provisions of the compliance program should be a factor in
the annual evaluation of each employee. The nursing facility should retain adequate
records of its training of employees, including attendance logs and material distributed
at training sessions. </p>

<p><strong>E. <u>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>In order for a compliance program to work, employees must be able to ask questions and
report problems. The first line supervisors play a key role in responding to employee
concerns and it is appropriate that they serve as a first line of communications. In order
to encourage communications, confidentiality and non-retaliation policies should be
developed and distributed to all employees.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Open lines of communication between the compliance officer and nursing facility
employees is equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program
and the reduction of any potential for fraud and abuse. In addition to serving as a
contact point for reporting problems, the compliance officer should be viewed as someone
to whom personnel can go to get clarification on the facility's policies. Questions and
responses should be documented and dated and, if appropriate, shared with other staff so
that standards can be updated and improved to reflect any necessary changes or
clarifications.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>2. Hotlines</strong> <strong>and Other Forms of Communication</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG encourages the use of hotlines,<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> e-mails,
newsletters, suggestion boxes, and other forms of information exchange to maintain open
lines of communication.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> If the nursing facility
establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available to all
employees, independent contractors, residents, and family members by circulating the
number on wallet cards or conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a
href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a> Employees should be permitted to report matters on an
anonymous basis. Matters reported through the hotline or other communication sources that
suggest substantial violations of compliance policies or Federal health care program
statutes and regulations should be documented and investigated promptly to determine their
veracity. The compliance officer should maintain a log that records such calls, including
the nature of any investigation and its results.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> Such
information, redacted of individual identifiers, should be included in reports to the
governing body, the CEO, and compliance committee.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>
While the nursing facility should always strive to maintain the confidentiality of an
employee's identity, it should also make clear that there may be a point where the
individual's identity may become known or may have to be revealed in certain instances.
The OIG recognizes that protecting anonymity may be infeasible for small nursing
facilities. However, the OIG believes all facility employees, when seeking answers to
questions or reporting potential instances of fraud and abuse, should know to whom to turn
for attention and should be able to do so without fear of retribution. </p>

<p><strong>F. <u>AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes that an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of
its implementation and an ongoing evaluation process. The compliance officer should
document this ongoing monitoring, including reports of suspected noncompliance, and share
these assessments with the nursing facility's senior management and the compliance
committee. The extent and frequency of the compliance audits may vary depending on
variables such as the nursing facility's available resources, prior history of
noncompliance, and the risk factors particular to the facility.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Although many assessment techniques are available, one effective tool is the
performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or external evaluators who
have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes, regulations, and program
requirements, as well as private payor rules. These assessments should focus both on the
nursing facility's day-to-day operations, as well as its adherence to the rules governing
claims development, billing and cost reports, and relationships with third parties. The
reviews also should address the nursing facility's compliance with the Medicare conditions
of participation and the specific rules and policies that have been the focus of
particular attention by the Medicare fiscal intermediaries or carriers, survey agencies,
and law enforcement.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer
to identify and review variations from an established performance baseline.<a
href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a> Significant variations from the baseline should
trigger an inquiry to determine the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that
the deviation occurred for legitimate reasons, the compliance officer and nursing facility
management may want to take no action. If it is determined that the deviation was caused
by a departure from or misunderstanding of the facility's policies, the nursing facility
should take prompt steps to correct the problem. Any overpayments discovered as a result
of such deviations should be returned promptly to the affected payor,<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
with appropriate documentation and a sufficiently detailed explanation of the reason for
the refund.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In addition to evaluating the facility's conformance with program rules, an effective
compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at least annual) reviews of whether
the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>, whether there has been
appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, ongoing educational programs, and
internal investigations of alleged non-compliance. This process will assess actual
conformance by all departments with the compliance program and may identify areas for
improvements in the program, as well as the nursing facility's general operations. </p>

<p>The OIG requires a provider operating under a CIA to conduct an annual assessment of
its compliance with the elements of the CIA. A compliance officer may want to review
several CIAs in designing the facility's self-audit protocol.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider
techniques such as: </p>

<p>on-site visits to all facilities owned and/or operated by the nursing home owner; </p>

<p>testing the billing and claims reimbursement staff on its knowledge of applicable
program requirements and claims and billing criteria; </p>

<p>unannounced mock surveys and audits; </p>

<p>examination of the organization's complaint logs and investigative files; </p>

<p>legal assessment of all contractual relationships with contractors, consultants and
potential referral sources; 

<ul>
  <li>reevaluation of deficiencies cited in past surveys for State requirements and Medicare
    conditions of participation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>checking personnel records to determine whether individuals who previously have been
    reprimanded for compliance issues are now conforming to facility policies; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of a broad cross-section of the nursing
    facility's employees and staff;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>validation of qualifications of nursing facility physicians and other staff, including
    verification of applicable State license renewals; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>trend analysis, or longitudinal studies, that uncover deviations in specific areas over
    a given period;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>analyzing past survey reports for patterns of deficiencies to determine if the proposed
    corrective plan of action identified the underlying problem and was undertaken within the
    assigned time limits. </li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewers should: 

<ul>
  <li>have the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential issues
    with the subject matter that is reviewed;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>be objective and independent of line management to the extent reasonably possible;<a
    href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel, and all
    relevant areas of operation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing body,
    and members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but no less often than
    annually; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The extent and scope of a nursing facility's compliance self-audits will depend on the
facility's identified risk areas, past history of deficiencies and enforcement actions,
and resources. If the facility comes under Government scrutiny in the future, the
Government will assess whether the facility developed a reasonable audit plan based upon
identified risk areas and resources. If the Government determines that the nursing
facility failed to develop an adequate audit program, the Government will be less likely
to afford the nursing facility favorable treatment under the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>G. <u>ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Disciplinary Policy and Enforcement</strong> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include disciplinary policies that set out the
consequences of violating the nursing facility's standards of conduct, policies and
procedures. Intentional noncompliance should subject transgressors to significant
sanctions. Such sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension, termination, or
financial penalties, as appropriate. Disciplinary action may be appropriate where a
responsible employee's failure to detect a violation is attributable to his or her
negligence or reckless conduct. Each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis
to determine the appropriate response. </p>

<p>The written standards of conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling
disciplinary problems and those who will be responsible for taking appropriate action.
Some disciplinary actions can be handled by department or agency managers, while others
may have to be resolved by a senior administrator. The nursing facility should advise
personnel that disciplinary action will be taken on a fair and equitable basis. Managers
and supervisors should be made aware that they have a responsibility to discipline
employees in an appropriate and consistent manner. </p>

<p>It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of disciplinary standards for improper
conduct and to educate employees regarding these standards. The consequences of
noncompliance should be consistently applied and enforced, in order for the disciplinary
policy to have the required deterrent effect. All levels of employees should be
potentially subject to the same types of disciplinary action for the commission of similar
offenses, because the commitment to compliance applies to all personnel within a nursing
facility. This means that corporate officers, managers, and supervisors should be held
accountable for failing to comply with, or for the foreseeable failure of their
subordinates to adhere to, the applicable standards, laws, and procedures. </p>

<p><strong>H. <u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION
INITIATIVES</u></strong> </p>

<p>Violations of a nursing facility's compliance program, failures to comply with
applicable Federal or State law, and other types of misconduct threaten a facility's
status as a reliable, honest and trustworthy provider of health care. Detected but
uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the reputation and legal status of the
nursing facility. Consequently, upon receipt of reports or reasonable indications of
suspected noncompliance, it is important that the compliance officer or other management
officials immediately investigate the allegations to determine whether a material
violation of applicable law or the requirements of the compliance program has occurred,
and if so, take decisive steps to correct the problem.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>
As appropriate, such steps may include a corrective action plan,<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
the return of any overpayments, a report to the Government,<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>
and/or a referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Where potential fraud is not involved, the OIG recommends that the nursing facility use
normal repayment channels to return overpayments as they are discovered. However, even if
the nursing facility's billing department is effectively using the overpayment detection
and return process, the OIG believes that the facility needs to alert the compliance
officer to those overpayments that may reveal trends or patterns indicative of a systemic
problem. </p>

<p>Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will
probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents. Under some circumstances,
the facility may need to consider engaging outside counsel, auditors, or health care
experts to assist in an investigation. Records of the investigation should contain
documentation of the alleged violation, a description of the investigative process
(including the objectivity of the investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of
interview notes and key documents, a log of the witnesses interviewed and the documents
reviewed, the results of the investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken,
and the corrective action implemented. While any action taken as the result of an
investigation will necessarily vary depending upon the situation, nursing facilities
should strive for some consistency by using sound practices and disciplinary protocols.<a
href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a> Further, the compliance officer should review the
circumstances that formed the basis for the investigation to determine whether similar
problems have been uncovered or modifications of the compliance program are necessary to
prevent and detect other inappropriate conduct or violations. </p>

<p>If the nursing facility undertakes an investigation of an alleged violation and the
compliance officer believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of
the presence of employees under investigation, the facility should remove those
individuals from their current responsibilities until the investigation is completed
(unless there is an ongoing internal or Government-led undercover operation known to the
nursing facility). In addition, the compliance officer should take appropriate steps to
secure or prevent the destruction of documents or other evidence relevant to the
investigation. If the nursing facility determines that disciplinary action is warranted,
it should be promptly imposed in accordance with the facility's written standards of
disciplinary action. </p>

<p><strong>2. Reporting</strong> </p>

<p>Where the compliance officer, compliance committee, or a management official discovers
credible evidence of misconduct from any source and, after a reasonable inquiry, has
reason to believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil or administrative law,
the facility should promptly report the existence of misconduct to the appropriate Federal
and State authorities<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a> within a reasonable period,
but not more than 60 days<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a> after determining that
there is credible evidence of a violation.<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a> Prompt
voluntary reporting will demonstrate the nursing facility's good faith and willingness to
work with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem. In addition,
reporting such conduct will be considered a mitigating factor by the OIG in determining
administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments, and exclusion), if the
reporting provider becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>When reporting to the Government, a nursing facility should provide all evidence
relevant to the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State law(s) and potential cost
impact. The compliance officer, under advice of counsel and with guidance from the
governmental authorities, could be requested to continue to investigate the reported
violation. Once the investigation is completed, the compliance officer should notify the
appropriate governmental authority of the outcome of the investigation, including a
description of the impact of the alleged violation on the operation of the applicable
health care programs or their beneficiaries. If the investigation ultimately reveals that
criminal, civil or OIG violations have occurred, the nursing facility should immediately
notify appropriate Federal and State authorities. </p>

<p>As previously stated, the nursing facility should take appropriate corrective action,
including prompt identification of any overpayment to the affected payor. If potential
fraud is involved, the nursing facility should return any overpayment during the course of
its disclosure to the Government. Otherwise, the nursing facility should use normal
repayment channels for reimbursing identified overpayments.<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>
A knowing and willful failure to disclose overpayments within a reasonable period of time
could be interpreted as an attempt to conceal the overpayment from the Government, thereby
establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation with respect to the nursing
facility, as well as any individual who may have been involved.<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>
For this reason, nursing facility compliance programs should emphasize that overpayments
should be promptly disclosed and returned to the entity that made the erroneous payment. </p>

<p><strong>III. ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</strong> </p>

<p>Considering the financial and human resources needed to establish an effective
compliance program, sound business principles dictate that the nursing home's management
evaluate the return on that investment. In addition, a compliance program must be
&quot;effective&quot; for the Government to view its existence as a mitigating factor when
assessing culpability. How a nursing facility assesses its compliance program performance
is therefore integral to its success. The attributes of each individual element of a
compliance program must be evaluated in order to assess the program's
&quot;effectiveness&quot; as a whole. Examining the comprehensiveness of policies and
procedures implemented to satisfy these elements is merely the first step. Evaluating how
a compliance program performs during the provider's day-to-day operations becomes the
critical indicator.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a> </p>

<p>As previously stated, a compliance program should require the development and
distribution of written compliance policies, standards, and practices that identify
specific areas of risk and vulnerability. One way to judge whether these policies,
standards, and practices measure up is to observe how an organization's employees react to
them. Do employees experience recurring pitfalls because the guidance on certain issues is
not adequately covered in company policies? Do employees flagrantly disobey an
organization's standards of conduct because they observe no sincere buy-in from senior
management? Do employees have trouble understanding policies and procedures because they
are written in legalese or at difficult reading levels? Does an organization routinely
experience systematic billing failures because of poor instructions to employees on how to
implement written policies and practices? Written compliance policies, standards, and
practices are only as good as an organization's commitment to apply them in practice. </p>

<p>Every nursing facility needs to seriously consider whoever fills the integral roles of
compliance officer and compliance committee members, and periodically monitor how the
individuals chosen satisfy their responsibilities. Does a compliance officer have
sufficient professional experience working with billing, clinical records, documentation,
and auditing principles to perform assigned responsibilities fully? Has a compliance
officer or compliance committee been unsuccessful in fulfilling their duties because of
inadequate funding, staff, and authority necessary to carry out their jobs? Did the
addition of the compliance officer function to a key management position with other
significant duties compromise the goals of the compliance program (<u>e.g.</u>, chief
financial officer who discounts certain overpayments identified to improve the company's
bottom line profits)? Since a compliance officer and a compliance committee can have a
significant impact on how effectively a compliance program is implemented, those functions
should not be taken for granted. </p>

<p>As evidenced throughout this guidance, the proper education and training of corporate
officers, managers, health care professionals, and other applicable employees of a
provider, and the continual retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant
elements of an effective compliance program. Accordingly, such efforts should be routinely
evaluated. Are employees trained frequently enough? Do employees fail post-training tests
that evaluate knowledge of compliance? Do training sessions and materials adequately
summarize important aspects of the organization's compliance program, such as fraud and
abuse laws, Federal health care program and private payor requirements, and claims
development and submission processes? Are training instructors qualified to present the
subject matter and experienced enough to field questions? When thorough compliance
training is periodically conducted, employees receive the reinforcement they need to
ensure an effective compliance program. </p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and a provider's employees
is equally important to the success of a compliance program. In today's intensive
regulatory environment, the OIG believes that a provider cannot possibly have an effective
compliance program if it receives minimal feedback from its employees regarding compliance
matters. For instance, if a compliance officer does not receive appropriate inquiries from
employees: Do policies and procedures fail to adequately guide employees to whom and when
they should be communicating compliance matters? Do employees fear retaliation if they
report misconduct? Are employees reporting issues not related to compliance through the
wrong channels? Do employees have bad-faith, ulterior motives for reporting? Regardless of
the means that a provider uses, whether it be telephone hotline, email, or suggestion
boxes, employees should seek clarification from compliance staff in the event of any
confusion or question dealing with compliance policies, practices, or procedures. </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for corporate officers, managers, health care professionals, and other employees who have
failed to adhere to an organization's standards of conduct, Federal health care program
requirements, or Federal or State laws. The number and caliber of disciplinary actions
taken by an organization can be insightful. Have appropriate sanctions been applied to
compliance misconduct? Are sanctions applied to all employees consistently, regardless of
an employee's level in the corporate hierarchy? Have double-standards in discipline bred
cynicism among employees? When disciplinary action is not taken seriously or applied
haphazardly, such practices reflect poorly on senior management's commitment to foster
compliance as well as the effectiveness of an organization's compliance program in
general. </p>

<p>Another critical component of a successful compliance program is an ongoing monitoring
and auditing process. The extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on
factors such as the size and available resources, prior history of noncompliance, and risk
factors of a particular nursing facility. The hallmark of effective monitoring and
auditing efforts is how an organization determines the parameters of its reviews. Do
audits focus on all pertinent departments of an organization? Does an audit cover
compliance with all applicable laws, as well as Federal and private payor requirements?
Are results of past audits, pre-established baselines, or prior deficiencies reevaluated?
Are the elements of the compliance program monitored? Are auditing techniques valid and
conducted by objective reviewers? The extent and sincerity of an organization's efforts to
confirm its compliance often proves to be a revealing determinant of a compliance
program's effectiveness. </p>

<p>It is essential that the compliance officer or other management officials immediately
investigate reports or reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance. If a material
violation of applicable law or compliance program requirements has occurred, a provider
must take decisive steps to correct the problem. Nursing facilities that do not thoroughly
investigate misconduct leave themselves open to undiscovered problems. When a provider
learns of certain issues, does it knowingly disregard associated legal exposure? Is there
a correlation between deficiency identified and the corrective action necessary to remedy?
Are isolated overpayment matters properly resolved through normal repayment channels? Is
credible evidence of misconduct that may violate criminal, civil or administrative law
promptly reported to the appropriate Federal and State authorities? If the process of
responding to detected offenses is circumvented, such conduct would indicate an
ineffective compliance program. </p>

<p>Documentation is the key to demonstrating the effectiveness of a nursing facility's
compliance program. For example, documentation of the following should be maintained:
audit results; logs of hotline calls and their resolution; corrective action plans; due
diligence efforts regarding business transactions; records of employee training, including
the number of training hours; disciplinary action; and modification and distribution of
policies and procedures. Because the OIG encourages self-disclosure of overpayments and
billing irregularities, maintaining a record of disclosures and refunds to the health care
programs is strongly endorsed. A documented practice of refunding of overpayments and
self-disclosing incidents of non-compliance with Federal and private payor health care
program requirements is powerful evidence of a meaningful compliance effort. </p>

<p><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation for the process
necessary to develop an effective and cost-efficient nursing facility compliance program.
However, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources of a particular
facility, depending upon its unique corporate structure, mission, and employee
composition. The statutes, regulations, and guidelines of the Federal and State health
insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private health plans,
should be integrated into every nursing facility's compliance program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches
millions of beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly
evolving. The time is right for nursing facilities to implement a strong voluntary health
care compliance program. Compliance is a dynamic process that helps to ensure that nursing
facilities and other health care providers are better able to fulfill their commitment to
ethical behavior, as well as meet the changes and challenges being placed upon them by
Congress and private insurers. Ultimately, it is the OIG's hope that a voluntarily created
compliance program will enable nursing facilities to meet their goals, improve the quality
of resident care, and substantially reduce fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as the cost of
health care to Federal, State, and private health insurers. <br wp="br1">

program guidances for the following six industry sectors: hospitals, clinical
laboratories, home health agencies, durable medical equipment suppliers, third-party
medical billing companies and hospices. Over the next year, the OIG plans to issue
compliance guidances for Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated care plans,
ambulance companies and small group physician practices. </p>

<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>For the purpose of this guidance, the term &quot;nursing
facility&quot; includes a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and a nursing facility (NF)
organization that meet the requirements of sections 1819 and 1919 of the Social Security
Act (Act), respectively, 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3 and 42 U.S.C. 1396r. Where appropriate we
distinguish between SNFs and other facilities. </p>

<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>The term &quot;Federal health care programs,&quot; as defined in
42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(f), includes any plan or program that provides health benefits, whether
directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded directly, in whole or in part,
by the United States Government (<u>i.e.</u>, via programs such as Medicare, Federal
Employees Health Benefits Act, Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Black Lung, or the
Longshore and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act) or any State health plan (<u>e.g.</u>,
Medicaid, or a program receiving funds from block grants for social services or child
health services). In this document, the term &quot;Federal health care program
requirements&quot; refers to the statutes, regulations and other rules governing Medicare,
Medicaid, and all other Federal health care programs. </p>

<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>Recent case law suggests that the failure of a corporate director
to attempt in good faith to institute a compliance program in certain situations may be a
breach of a director's fiduciary obligation. <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In re Caremark
International Inc. Derivative Litigation</u>, 698 A.2d 959 (Ct. Chanc. Del. 1996). </p>

<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a><u>See</u> 63 FR 70137 (December 12, 1998) &quot;Notice for
Solicitation of Information and Recommendations for Developing OIG Compliance Program
Guidance for the Nursing Home Industry.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>The OIG periodically issues advisory opinions responding 
  to specific inquires concerning the application of the OIG's authorities and 
  Special Fraud Alerts setting forth activities that raise legal and enforcement 
  issues. These documents, as well as reports from OAS and OEI can be obtained 
  on the Internet at:<em> http://www.oig.hhs.gov.</em> <a href="../../../index.html"></a> 
  We also recommend that nursing home providers regularly review the Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) website on the Internet at: <em>http://www.hcfa.gov</em>, 
  for up-to-date regulations, manuals, and program memoranda related to the Medicare 
  and Medicaid programs. </p>

<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>Counsel to the nursing facility should be consulted as
appropriate regarding interpretation and legal analysis of laws related to the Federal
health care programs and laws related to fraud, abuse and other legal requirements. </p>

<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an <em>effective</em>
compliance program that pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the
appropriateness of administrative sanctions. However, the burden is on the nursing
facility to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of the compliance program. Further,
the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, provides that a person who has violated the
Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government within 30 days of
detection, in certain circumstances will be subject to not less than double, as opposed to
treble, damages. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 3729(a). In addition, criminal sanctions may be
mitigated by an effective compliance program that was in place at the time of the criminal
offense. <u>See</u> note 11. </p>

<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>For example, this would include providers that own hospitals,
skilled nursing facilities, long-term care facilities and hospices. </p>

<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>A formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of
directors, owner(s), or president, where applicable. Evidence of that commitment should
include the allocation of adequate resources, a timetable, and the identification of an
individual to serve as a compliance officer or coordinator to ensure that each of the
recommended and adopted elements is addressed. Once a commitment has been established, a
compliance officer should immediately be chosen to oversee the implementation of the
compliance program. </p>

<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a><u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines
Manual</u>, 8 A1.2, Application Note 3(k). The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed
policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe the
appropriate sanctions for offenders convicted of Federal crimes. </p>

<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>The roles of the compliance officer and the corporate
compliance committee in implementing an effective compliance program are discussed
throughout this guidance. However, the OIG recognizes that the differences in the sizes
and structures of nursing facilities may result in differences in the way in which
compliance programs function. </p>

<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>Training and educational programs for nursing facilities should
be detailed, comprehensive and at the same time targeted to address the needs of specific
employees based on their responsibilities within the facility. Existing in-service
training programs can be expanded to address general compliance issues, as well as the
risk areas identified in that part of nursing home operations. </p>

<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>For example, periodically spot-checking the work of coding and
billing personnel should be part of a compliance program. In addition, procedures to
regularly monitor the care provided nursing facility residents and to ensure that
deficiencies identified by surveyors are corrected should be incorporated into the
compliance program's evaluation and monitoring functions. </p>

<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization
must have established compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees
and other agents in order to receive sentencing credit for an &quot;effective&quot;
compliance program. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines define &quot;agent&quot; as
&quot;any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an independent
contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization.&quot; <u>See</u> United
States Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(d). </p>

<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>The OIG strongly encourages the participation and involvement
of the nursing facility's owner(s), governing board, CEO, as well as other personnel from
various levels of the organizational structure in the development of all aspects of the
compliance program, especially the standards of conduct. Management and employee
involvement in this process communicates a strong and explicit commitment to all employees
of the need to comply with the organization's standards of conduct. </p>

<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>The code also should be distributed, or at least available, to
the residents and their families, as well as the physicians and contractors associated
with the facility. </p>

<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>Documentation of employee training and other compliance efforts
is important in conducting internal assessments of the compliance program, as well as
during any third-party evaluation of facility's efforts to comply with Federal health care
program requirements. <u>See</u> section II.F. </p>

<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a><u>See</u> <em>http://www.hcfa.gov</em> for a set of all
Medicare and Medicaid manuals. </p>

<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>In addition, all providers should be aware of the enforcement
priorities of Federal and State regulators and law enforcement agencies. OIG periodically
issues Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins that identify activities
believed to raise enforcement concerns. These documents and other materials that provide
insight into the nursing home enforcement priorities of the OIG are referenced throughout
this guidance. </p>

<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>The OIG recommends that, in addition to the list set forth
below, the provider review the OIG's Work Plan to identify vulnerabilities and risk areas
on which the OIG will focus during the following year. In addition, it is recommended that
the nursing facility routinely review the OIG's semiannual reports, which identify program
vulnerabilities and risk areas that the OIG has targeted during the preceding six months.
All of these documents are available on the OIG's webpage at <em>http://www.oig.hhs.gov</em>.
</p>

<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>State and local agencies enter into agreements with DHHS under
which they survey and make recommendations regarding whether providers meet the Medicare
conditions of participation or other requirements for SNFs and NFs (<u>See</u> 42 CFR
488.10). </p>

<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>42 CFR 483.25. <u>See</u> OIG report OEI-02-98-00331
&quot;Quality of Care in Nursing Homes: An Overview,&quot; in which the OIG found that,
although the overall number of deficiencies identified through the survey and
certification process was decreasing, the number of &quot;quality of care&quot; and other
serious deficiencies was increasing. </p>

<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a><u>See</u> 42 CFR part 483, which establishes requirements for
long term care facilities. HCFA's regulations establish conditions that must be met for a
nursing facility to qualify to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. State
licensure laws may impose additional requirements for the establishment and certification
of a nursing facility. </p>

<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a><u>See</u> 42 CFR part 488, subparts A, B, C, E, and F. The
survey instrument is used to identify deficiencies, such as: failure to notify residents
of their rights; improper use of restraints for discipline purposes; lack of a clean and
safe environment; failure to provide care for basic living activities, including failing
to prevent and/or treat pressure sores, urinary incontinence, hydration; and failing to
properly feed residents. </p>

<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>As stated above, each resident must receive the necessary care
and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and
psychosocial well-being, in accordance with the resident's assessment and plan of care (<u>See</u>
42 CFR 483.25). The OIG recognizes that this standard does not always lend itself to easy,
objective evaluation. The matter is further complicated by the right of the resident, or
his or her legal representative, to decide on a course of treatment that may be
contraindicated. The Patient Self-Determination Act (P.L. 103-413) requires health care
institutions to educate patients about advance directives and to document their decision
on life-sustaining treatments. </p>

<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>HCFA has created a repository of best practice guidelines for
the care of residents at risk of pressure ulcers, dehydration and malnutrition. In
addition, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, National Academy
of Sciences, has established recommended dietary allowances. </p>

<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>The OIG has conducted a series of reviews that focused on
prescription drug use in nursing homes. <u>See</u> OIG reports OEI-06-96-00080,
OEI-06-96-0008, OEI-06-96-00082, &quot;Prescription Drug Use in Nursing Homes.&quot; The
OIG found that patients experienced adverse reactions to various drugs as a result of
inappropriate prescribing and inadequate monitoring of medication usage. The reviews
revealed serious concerns, including residents receiving drugs for which their medical
records lacked evidence of a prescription; and the prescription of drugs judged
inappropriate for use by elderly persons. The studies also found that medication records
were often incomplete and not readily accessible, making it difficult for a pharmacist to
identify or confirm drug regimens or problems. </p>

<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>For example, Federal regulations require that the medical care
of each resident should be supervised by a physician, who must see the resident at least
once every 30 days for the first 90 days after admission and at least once every 60 days
thereafter (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483 40(c)). The facility also must retain the services of a
registered nurse, 42 CFR 483.30, as well as a qualified dietitian. 42 CFR 483.35. In
addition to these basic Federal requirements, the OIG strongly believes that the facility
should conform to State-mandated staffing levels where they exist and adopt its own
minimum &quot;hours per patient&quot; staffing standards in any case. At the heart of many
quality of care deficiencies is a lack of adequate staff needed to provide basic nursing
services. </p>

<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a><u>See</u> OIG report OEI-09-97-00120 &quot;Medical Necessity
of Physical and Occupational Therapy in Skilled Nursing Facilities,&quot; which found a
high rate of medically unnecessary therapies in a number of nursing facilities; such
unnecessary services lead to inappropriate care. With the introduction of the prospective
payment system, nursing facilities should ensure that financial pressures do not create
incentives to <u>underutilize</u> medically necessary therapeutic services. </p>

<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>In addition to providing the facility's management important
information about the state of care in the facility, the self-reporting of resident abuse,
including injuries of unknown sources, is a condition of participation (<u>See</u> 42 CFR
483.13(c)(2)). Although State surveyors conduct complaint surveys when they receive a
complaint, these surveys can only occur if the surveyors are aware of the problem. </p>

<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>See generally, 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3 and 42 CFR part 483. </p>

<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a>In OIG report OEI-02-98-00350 &quot;Long Term Ombudsman
Program: Complaint Trends,&quot; the OIG points out that complaints about resident care
and resident rights have been increasing. Resident care concerns included complaints about
personal care, such as a pressure and hygiene, lack of rehabilitation, the inappropriate
use of restraints, abuse and neglect, problems with admissions and eviction, and the
exercise of personal rights. </p>

<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>Nursing facilities should offer care to all patients who are
eligible in accordance with Federal and State laws governing admissions (<u>See</u> 42 CFR
483.12(d)). The provider also should maintain identical policies regarding &quot;transfer,
discharge, and provision of services under the State plan&quot; for all residents,
regardless of payment source (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.12(c)). <u>See also</u> OIG report

Despite Federal and State Oversight</u> (GAO/HEHS-98-202, July, 1998). As noted
previously, the facility must establish a process by which the facility administrator is
informed of incidents of abuse and an investigation is conducted within 5 days of the
incident (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.13(c)(4)). </p>

<p><a name="N_36_">36. </a><u>See</u> OIG Report OEI-01-91-00840 &quot;Minimizing
Restraints in Nursing Homes: A Guide to Action.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="N_37_">37. </a>It is a violation of the Medicare conditions of participation
to make unauthorized disclosures from the resident's medical records (<u>See</u> 42 CFR
483.10(e)). The facility should also establish policies that respect each resident's right
to privacy in personal communications, including the right to receive mail that is
unopened and to the use of a telephone where calls can be made in privacy. </p>

<p><a name="N_38_">38. </a>The right of self-determination includes the resident's right
to choose a personal physician, to be fully informed of his or her health status, and
participate in treatment decisions, including the right to refuse treatment, unless
adjudged incompetent or incapacitated (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(d)). </p>

<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>This includes preserving the resident's right to manage his or
her financial affairs or permit the facility to hold and manage personal funds. The
resident should receive a full and complete accounting of personal funds held by the
facility (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10 (c)). If a misappropriation of a resident's property is
uncovered, the facility administrator should be notified immediately and an investigation
conducted. Finally, the provider should take measures to ensure that personal funds have
not been used to pay for items or services paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. </p>

<p><a name="N_40_">40. </a><u>See</u> OIG Report A-17-99-00099 &quot;Improper Fiscal Year
1998 Fee-for-Service Payments&quot; in which the OIG estimated that improper Medicare
benefit payments made during FY 1998 totaled $12.6 billion in processed fee-for-service
payments. SNF payment errors were a result of claims for services lacking medical
necessity and represented 7 percent of the total estimated improper payments. The OIG
could not and did not quantify what percentage of the improper payments was the result of
fraud. Significantly, it was only through a review of medical records that the majority of
these billing errors were detected, since when the claims were submitted to the Medicare
contractor, they contained no visible errors. </p>

<p><a name="N_41_">41. </a>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), Public Law 105-33,
established PPS for SNFs. Under PPS, all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital) related
to services furnished to beneficiaries covered under Part A, including certain Part B
services, are paid a predetermined amount based on the medical condition and needs of the
resident, as reflected in the Resource Utilization Group (RUG) code assigned to that
resident. Other Part B services will continue to be reimbursed separately to the providers
of such services pending implementation of a new consolidated billing system. </p>

<p><a name="N_42_">42. </a>For example, the OIG has investigated suppliers of ancillary
services that improperly bill for an hour of therapy when only a few minutes were
provided. Similarly, vendors that knowingly submit a claim for an expensive prosthetic
device when the resident only received non-covered adult diapers have been the subject of
enforcement actions. When consolidated billing is implemented, vendors will not submit
bills directly to Medicare for such services. As the entity submitting the claim, the
nursing facility will need to have any certifications or orders necessary to provide the
service, as well as supporting documentation required, to receive payment. </p>

<p><a name="N_43_">43. </a>Billing for medically unnecessary services, supplies and
equipment involves seeking reimbursement for a service that is not warranted by a
resident's documented medical condition. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395i(a)(1)(A) (&quot;no
payment may be made under part A or part B [of Medicare] for any expenses incurred for
items or services which . . . are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or
treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of the malformed body
member&quot;). In the Special Fraud Alert &quot;Fraud and Abuse in the Provision of
Services in Nursing Facilities&quot; (June 1996), the OIG identified several types of
fraudulent arrangements through which health care providers inappropriately billed
Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary or non-rendered items and services. </p>

<p>Under PPS, the provision of unnecessary services may take a different form. As
discussed below, manipulation of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) to fit a resident into a
higher RUG can result in the provision of medically unnecessary services. In addition, a
nursing facility may not enter into arrangements with providers of ancillary services
through which the facility overutilizes services reimbursed under Part B in return for an
offset in the cost of items or services covered under Part A. </p>

<p><a name="N_44_">44. </a>Medicare Part A benefits in skilled nursing facilities are
limited to beneficiaries who require services rendered by technical or professional
personnel in a skilled nursing setting (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 409.30). Knowingly
misrepresenting the nature or level of services provided to a Medicare beneficiary to
circumvent the program's limitation is fraudulent. </p>

<p><a name="N_45_">45. </a>Duplicate billing occurs when the nursing facility bills for
the same item or service more than once or when a vendor bills the Federal health care
program for an item or service also billed by the facility. Although duplicate billing can
occur due to simple error, the knowing submission of duplicate claims -- which is
sometimes evidenced by systematic or repeated double billing -- can create liability under
criminal, civil, or administrative law. When Medicare Part B implements consolidated
billing, facilities should modify all agreements with vendors to require that the vendor
bill the facility for those services covered under consolidated billing requirements and
not submit bills directly to Medicare for such services. </p>

<p><a name="N_46_">46. </a>A credit balance is an excess payment made to a health care
provider as a result of patient billing or claims processing error. Nursing facilities
should institute procedures to provide for the timely identification, accurate reporting
and repayment of credit balances. In addition, the provider should promptly repay if a
resident is also entitled to a credit. <u>See</u> OIG report OEI-07-09-00910
&quot;Medicare Credit Balances in Skilled Nursing Facility Patient Accounts&quot; and
OEI-07-09-00911 &quot;Medicaid Credit Balances in Skilled Nursing Facility Patient
Accounts,&quot; in which the OIG found that skilled nursing facilities were not accurately
or completely adjusting and reporting credit balance amounts due to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Significantly, the intentional concealment of a known overpayment may
expose a provider to criminal sanctions (S<u>ee</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3)), and civil
liability under the False Claims Act. </p>

<p><a name="N_47_">47. </a>Billing for services or items not ordered involves seeking
reimbursement for services provided but not ordered by the treating physician or other
authorized person. </p>

<p><a name="N_48_">48. </a><u>See</u> discussion on quality of care standards in nursing
facilities in section II.B.2.a above and the accompanying notes. Knowingly billing for
inadequate or substandard care may create liability under administrative, civil and
criminal law. </p>

<p><a name="N_49_">49. </a>Upcoding involves the selection of a billing code that is not
the most appropriate descriptor of the service or condition, in order to maximize
reimbursement. Under PPS, upcoding may take the form of &quot;RUG creep.&quot;<a
href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> </p>

<p><a name="N_50_">50. </a>&quot;RUG creep&quot; occurs when a nursing facility
mischaracterizes the condition and needs of a resident in order to get a higher RUG rate
and greater per diem reimbursement. The OIG is concerned that nursing facilities may
select higher RUG categories than necessary to maximize income, although not always
necessarily for the well-being of the patient. </p>

<p><a name="N_51_">51. </a>A related risk area involves bill splitting schemes. This
billing abuse usually takes the form of manipulating the billing for procedures to create
the appearance that the services were rendered over a period of days when all treatment
occurred during one visit. </p>

<p><a name="N_52_">52. </a>The OIG has investigated a number of cases where signatures
were forged, either to fabricate evidence that a physician ordered equipment or services
or to create a paper trail in support of items or services that were never provided. </p>

<p><a name="N_53_">53. </a>Nursing homes are required to submit various reports to Federal
and State agencies in connection with facility operations and to receive reimbursement for
the care provided to program beneficiaries. Because program payments are in part based on
self-reported operating costs, providers must implement procedures to ensure that these
reports are prepared as accurately as possible. This should include measures to ensure
that adequate documentation exists to support information provided in the report,
non-allowable costs are appropriately identified and removed, and related party
transactions are treated consistent with program requirements (<u>See</u> 42 CFR part
413). If the provider intends to claim costs in non-conformity with program rules, those
items should be flagged in a letter accompanying the cost report. </p>

<p>Prior enforcement actions involving nursing home cost reports have focused on nursing
facilities that claimed salary expenses for employees who do not exist, inflated the
number of residents served, included non-reimbursable costs with nursing home-related
expenses, inappropriately shifted costs to cost centers that are below the reimbursement
cap, and shifted non-Medicare related costs to Medicare cost centers. </p>

<p><a name="N_54_">54. </a>The CIA imposes reporting requirements, independent audits, and
other procedures on providers who have demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to
independently adopt these measures. It is clearly in a provider's best interest to avoid
the implementation of a CIA by instituting its own prevention, detection, and disclosure
mechanisms. </p>

<p><a name="N_55_">55. </a>In OIG report A-12-97-0003 &quot;Safeguarding Long Term Care
Residents,&quot; it was noted that although no Federal requirement exists for criminal
background checks on nursing home staff, 33 States currently require that such checks
occur. However, there appears to be great diversity in the way States identify,
investigate, and report suspected abuse of nursing home residents. </p>

<p><a name="N_56_">56. </a>The effect of an OIG exclusion from Federal health care
programs is that no Federal health care program payment may be made for any items or
services: (1) furnished by an excluded individual or entity; or (2) directed or prescribed
by an excluded physician (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 1001.1901). An excluded individual or entity
that submits a claim for reimbursement to a Federal health care program, or causes such a
claim to be submitted, may be subject to a civil money penalty of $10,000 for each item or
service furnished during the period that the person or entity was excluded (<u>See</u> 42
U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(1)(D)). The individual or entity may also be subject to treble damages
for the amount claimed for each item or service (<u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)). <u>Also
see</u> OIG Special Advisory Bulletin &quot;The Effect of Exclusion From Participation in
Federal Health Care Programs&quot; (September 1999). </p>

<p><a name="N_57_">57. </a><sup>56</sup>Likewise, the facility should establish standards
prohibiting the execution of contracts with companies that have been recently convicted of
a criminal offense related to health care or that are listed by a Federal agency as
debarred, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care
programs. Prospective employees or contractors that have been officially reinstated into
the Medicare and Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof
of such reinstatement. </p>

<p><a name="N_58_">58. </a>Among the sources of information on prospective employees are
the State registry of nurse's aides, which provides a list of nurse aides that have
successfully completed training and competency evaluations and the National Practitioner
Data Bank. The Data Bank is a data base that contains information about medical
malpractice payments, sanctions by boards of medical examiners or State licensing boards,
adverse clinical privilege actions, and adverse professional society membership actions.
Health care entities can have access to this data base to seek information about their own
medical or clinical staff, as well as prospective employees or physician contractors. </p>

<p><a name="N_59_">59. </a>The OIG &quot;List of Excluded Individuals/Entities&quot;

Federal health care programs. This report, in both an on-line searchable and downloadable
database, can be located on the Internet at <em>www.hhs.gov/oig</em>. In addition, the
General Services Administration maintains a monthly listing of debarred contractors,

at <em>www.arnet.gov/epls</em>. </p>

<p>The OIG sanction information is readily available to users in two formats on over
15,000 individuals and entities currently excluded from program participation through
action taken by the OIG. The on-line searchable database allows users to obtain
information regarding excluded individuals and entities sorted by: (1) the legal bases for
exclusions; (2) the types of individuals and entities excluded by the OIG; and (3) the
States where excluded individuals reside or entities do business. </p>

<p><a name="N_60_">60. </a>The introduction of PPS and consolidated billing for Medicare
Part B services means that vendors and their subcontractors no longer submit bills
directly to Medicare for their services. Instead, the nursing facility will be submitting
consolidated bills for certain services provided to residents. Because of the new
responsibilities that are imposed on nursing facilities under these reimbursement schemes,
the facility may be held responsible if it claims reimbursement for items or services
provided by a contractor that has been excluded. </p>

<p><a name="N_61_">61. </a>The anti-kickback statute provides criminal penalties for
individuals and entities that knowingly offer, pay, solicit or receive bribes or kickbacks
or other remuneration in order to induce business reimbursable by Federal health care
programs (<u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)). Civil penalties and exclusion from
participation in the Federal health care programs may also result from a violation of the
prohibition (<u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5) and 1320a-7(b)(7)) . </p>

<p><a name="N_62_">62. </a>The Stark physician self-referral law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn,
prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity with which the physician or any
member of the physician's immediate family has a financial relationship, if the referral
is for the furnishing of designated health services. </p>

<p><a name="N_63_">63. </a>The OIG has issued several advisory opinions applying the
Federal statutes to arrangements that affect nursing facilities. The opinions are
available on the Internet at <em>http://www.oig.hhs.gov.</em> </p>

<p><a name="N_64_">64. </a>Contracts between the facility and any entity in which the
facility's medical director has a financial interest may be subject to the Stark law and
should be reviewed and approved by legal counsel. </p>

<p><a name="N_65_">65. </a>In the OIG Special Fraud Alert &quot;Routine Waiver of Part B
Co-payments/Deductibles&quot; (May 1991), the OIG describes several reasons why routine
waivers of these cost-sharing amounts pose abuse concerns. The Alert sets forth the
circumstances under which it may be appropriate to waive these amounts. </p>

<p><a name="N_66_">66. </a>In the Special Fraud Alert &quot;Fraud and Abuse in Nursing
Home Arrangements with Hospices&quot; (March 1998), the OIG sets out the vulnerabilities
in nursing home arrangements with hospices. The Alert provides several examples of
questionable arrangements between hospices and nursing homes that could inappropriately
influence the referral of patients. Examples include the offering of free goods or goods
at below fair market value to induce a nursing home to refer patients to the hospice.
Other examples demonstrating vulnerability to fraud and abuse include: (1) a hospice
paying for room and board in excess of the amounts the nursing home would normally charge
or receive from Medicaid; (2) a hospice paying for additional services that should be
already included in the room and board payment; (3) a hospice referring patients to the
nursing home in return for the nursing home's referral to the hospice. While the Special
Fraud Alert focused on arrangements with hospices, nursing facilities should adopt
policies that prohibit similar questionable arrangements with all health care providers. </p>

<p><a name="N_67_">67. </a>Providers should establish clear policies governing
gift-giving, because such exchanges may be viewed as inducements to influence business
decisions. Offering or providing any gift of more than nominal value to any beneficiary
may be done with the intent to inappropriately influence health care decisions of the
beneficiary or his or her family. Similarly, accepting gifts, hospitality, or
entertainment from a source that is in a position to benefit from the referral of
business, raises concerns that the gift may influence the employee's independent judgment.
If the provider decides to allow employees to accept gifts or other gratuities below a
certain nominal value or in an aggregate amount below an established amount per year, the
provider should consider requiring employees to report those gifts. </p>

<p><a name="N_68_">68. </a><u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(d)(2) which prescribes criminal
penalties for knowingly and willfully charging for services provided to a Medicaid patient
in excess of the rates established by the State; <u>see also</u> 42 CFR 483.12(d). </p>

<p><a name="N_69_">69. </a>Under PPS, the payment rates represent payment in full, subject
to applicable coinsurance. This includes payment for all costs associated with furnishing
covered SNF services to Medicare beneficiaries. It is impermissible for a hospital to pay
for SNF services if it were to do so only for those residents who are Medicare
beneficiaries discharged from that hospital. However, it would be permissible for a
hospital to provide or pay for items or services that are furnished to SNF residents
generally, if such payments are made without regard to the payment source for the
individual resident. In addition, a hospital and a SNF can enter into a permissible bed
reservation agreement (<u>See</u> HCFA <u>Provider Reimbursement Manual</u>, Part I,
section 2105.3). </p>

<p><a name="N_70_">70. </a>All physician contracts and agreements should be reviewed to
avoid violation of the anti-kickback, self-referral, and other relevant Federal and State
laws. The OIG has published safe harbors that define practices not subject to the
anti-kickback statute, because such arrangements would be unlikely to result in fraud or
abuse. Failure to comply with a safe harbor provision does not make an arrangement per se
illegal. Rather, the safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, if fully met, would
assure the entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the arrangement
qualifying for the safe harbor. One such safe harbor applies to personal services
contracts (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 1001.952(d)). </p>

<p><a name="N_71_">71. </a><u>See</u> OIG Special Fraud Alert &quot;Fraud and Abuse in the
Provision of Medical Supplies to Nursing Facilities&quot; (August 1995). As well as
violating the anti-kickback statute, both the supplier and the nursing facility may be
liable for false claims if the medically unnecessary items are billed to Federal health
care programs. <u>See also</u> OIG Advisory Opinion No.99-2 (February 1999). </p>

<p><a name="N_72_">72. </a>In addition to raising concerns related to the anti-kickback
statute, the unauthorized disclosure of confidential records violates the resident's
rights (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 10(e)). </p>

<p><a name="N_73_">73. </a><u>See</u> OIG Special Fraud Alert &quot;Joint Venture
Arrangements&quot; (August 1989); OIG Special Fraud Alert &quot;Fraud and Abuse in the
Provision of Services in Nursing Facilities&quot; (May 1996). </p>

<p><a name="N_74_">74. </a>&quot;Swapping&quot; occurs when a supplier gives a nursing
facility discounts on Medicare Part A items and services in return for the referrals of
Medicare Part B business. With swapping, there is a risk that suppliers may offer a SNF an
excessively low price for items or services reimbursed under PPS in return for the ability
to service and bill nursing facility residents with Part B coverage. <u>See</u> OIG
Advisory Opinion 99-2 (March 1999). </p>

<p><a name="N_75_">75. </a>Among the materials useful in documenting the compliance
program are employee certifications relating to training and other compliance initiatives,
copies of compliance training materials, and hotline logs and any corresponding reports of
investigation, outcomes, and employee disciplinary actions. In addition, the facility
should keep all relevant correspondence between carriers, fiscal intermediaries, private
payor insurers, HCFA, and State survey and certification agencies. </p>

<p><a name="N_76_">76. </a>In addition to prohibiting the falsification and backdating of
records, the provider should have clear guidelines, consistent with applicable
professional and legal standards, that set out the circumstances when late entries may be
made in a record. </p>

<p><a name="N_77_">77. </a><sup>76</sup>The OIG believes it is not advisable for the
compliance function to be subordinate to the nursing facility's general counsel, or
comptroller or similar financial officer. Free standing compliance functions help to
ensure independent and objective legal reviews and financial analysis of the institution's
compliance efforts and activities. By separating the compliance function from the key
management positions of general counsel or chief financial officer (where the size and
structure of the nursing facility make this a feasible option), a system of checks and
balances is established to more effectively achieve the goals of the compliance program. </p>

<p><a name="N_78_">78. </a>For multi-facility organizations, the OIG encourages
coordination with each facility owned by the corporation through the use of a
headquarter's compliance officer, communicating with parallel positions or compliance
liaison in each facility or regional office, as appropriate. </p>

<p><a name="N_79_">79. </a><a name="Footnote"></a><u>See</u> note 60. </p>

<p><a name="N_80_">80. </a><sup>79</sup><u>See</u> note 61. </p>

<p><a name="N_81_">81. </a>The compliance officer may also have to ensure that the
criminal backgrounds of employees have been checked depending upon State requirements or
nursing facility policy. </p>

<p><a name="N_82_">82. </a>There are many approaches the compliance officer may enlist to
maintain the vitality of the compliance program. Periodic on-site visits of nursing
facility operations, bulletins with compliance updates and reminders, distribution of
audiotapes or videotapes on different risk areas, lectures at management and employee
meetings, and circulation of recent health care articles covering fraud and abuse are some
examples of approaches the compliance officer can employ. </p>

<p><a name="N_83_">83. </a><sup>82</sup>The compliance committee benefits from having the
perspectives of individuals with varying responsibilities in the organization, such as
operations, finance, audit, human resources, and clinical management (<u>e.g.</u>, the
nursing facility physician), as well as employees and managers of key operating units. The
compliance officer should be an integral member of the committee as well. All committee
members should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive experience within their
respective departments to implement any necessary changes to policies and procedures as
recommended by the committee. </p>

<p><a name="N_84_">84. </a>A health care provider should expect its compliance committee
members and compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment,
assertiveness, and an approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of
employees of the nursing facility. These interpersonal skills are as important as the
professional experience of each member of the compliance committee. </p>

<p><a name="N_85_">85. </a>Specific compliance training should complement any
&quot;in-service&quot; training sessions that a nursing facility may regularly schedule to
provide an ongoing program for the training of employees as required by its conditions of
participation. </p>

<p><a name="N_86_">86. </a><sup>85</sup>Some publications, such as OIG's Special Fraud
Alerts, audit and inspection reports, and advisory opinions are readily available from the
OIG and can provide a basis for educational courses and programs for appropriate nursing
facility employees. </p>

<p><a name="N_87_">87. </a>Significant variations in the functions and responsibilities of
different departments or groups may create the need for training materials that are
tailored to compliance concerns associated with particular operations and duties. </p>

<p><a name="N_88_">88. </a>Certain positions, such as those that involve billing, coding
and the submission of reimbursement data, create greater organizational legal exposure,
and therefore require specialized training. Those hired to treat residents should undergo
specialized training in residents' rights and survey and certification procedures. </p>

<p><a name="N_89_">89. </a>Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of
training provided and employee comprehension of the nursing facility's policies and
procedures. </p>

<p><a name="N_90_">90. </a>In addition, where feasible, the OIG recommends that a nursing
facility give vendors and outside contractors the opportunity to participate in the
nursing facility's compliance training and educational programs. Such training is
particularly important for facilities that rely on agencies to provide temporary direct
care staff. The introduction of consolidated billing gives added importance to educating
vendors about the facility's compliance policies and procedures. </p>

<p><a name="N_91_">91. </a>Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of
corporate integrity agreements that require many of these training elements. The OIG
usually requires a minimum of one to three hours annually for basic training in compliance
areas. Additional training is required for specialty fields such as claims development and
billing. </p>

<p><a name="N_92_">92. </a><sup>91</sup> In some cases, employees sue their employers
under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u> <u>tam </u>provisions out of frustration because
of the company's failure to take action when the employee brought a questionable,
fraudulent, or abusive situation to the attention of senior corporate officials. Whistle
blowers must be protected against retaliation, a concept embodied in the provisions of the
False Claims Act (<u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 3730(h)). </p>

<p><a name="N_93_">93. </a>Nursing facilities can also consider rewarding employees for
appropriate use of established reporting systems. After all, the employee who identifies
and helps stop an abusive practice can benefit the corporation as much as one who
identifies cost-savings measures or increases corporate revenues. </p>

<p><a name="N_94_">94. </a>The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for
a smaller nursing facility to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls
about compliance issues. These companies may want to explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>,
outsourcing the hotline or establishing a written method of confidential disclosure. </p>

<p><a name="N_95_">95. </a>In addition, an effective employee exit interview program could
be designed to solicit information from departing employees regarding potential misconduct
and suspected violations of nursing facility policy and procedures. </p>

<p><a name="N_96_">96. </a>Nursing facilities should also post in a prominent area the
HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800-HHS-TIPS). </p>

<p><a name="N_97_">97. </a>To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the
nursing facility should create an intake form for all compliance issues identified through
reporting mechanisms. The form could include information concerning the date that the
potential problem was reported, the results of the internal investigation, and, as
appropriate, the corrective action implemented, the disciplinary measures imposed, and/or
any identified overpayments returned. </p>

<p><a name="N_98_">98. </a>Information obtained over the hotline may provide valuable
insight into management practices and operations, whether reported problems are actual or
perceived. </p>

<p><a name="N_99_">99. </a>Even when a nursing facility or group of facilities is owned by
a larger corporate entity, the regular auditing and monitoring of the compliance
activities of an individual facility must be a key feature in any annual review.
Appropriate reports on audit findings should be periodically provided and explained to a
parent organization's senior staff and officers. </p>

<p><a name="N_100_">100. </a><u>See also</u> section II.B.2. </p>

<p><a name="N_101_">101. </a><sup>100</sup>The OIG recommends that when a compliance
program is established in a nursing facility, the compliance officer, with the assistance
of department managers, should take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of their operations from a
compliance perspective. This assessment can be undertaken by outside consultants or
internal staff, provided they have knowledge of health care program requirements. This
&quot;snapshot&quot; can serve as a baseline for the compliance officer and other managers
to judge the nursing facility's progress in reducing potential areas of vulnerability. </p>

<p><a name="N_102_">102. </a><u>See</u> Provider Reimbursement Manual 1,  2836(D)(3),
which sets out the MDS correction policy. </p>

<p><a name="N_103_">103. </a>In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section H.2,
below, reports of fraud or systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate
governmental authority. </p>

<p><a name="N_104_">104. </a>Examples of CIA audit protocols can be obtained from the OIG
by submitting a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has issued a detailed guide for
conducting an independent assessment of a health care provider's conformance to a CIA. <u>See</u>
AICPA Statement of Position 99-1, &quot;Guidance to Practitioners in Conducting and
Reporting on an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement to Assist in Evaluating Compliance with
a Corporate Integrity Agreement&quot; ( May 1999). </p>

<p><a name="N_105_">105. </a>The OIG recognizes that nursing facilities that have limited
resources may not be able to use internal reviewers who are not part of line management or
hire outside reviewers. </p>

<p><a name="N_106_">106. </a>Instances of noncompliance must be determined on a
case-by-case basis. The existence or amount of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care
program is not solely determinative of whether the conduct should be investigated and
reported to governmental authorities. In fact, there may be instances where there is no
readily identifiable monetary loss, but corrective actions are still necessary to protect
the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries, <u>e.g.</u>, where services
required by a plan of care are not provided. </p>

<p><a name="N_107_">107. </a>The nursing facility may seek advice from its in-house
counsel or an outside law firm to determine the extent of the facility's liability and to
plan the appropriate course of action. </p>

<p><a name="N_108_">108. </a><sup>107</sup>Nursing facilities are required to immediately
report all alleged incidents of mistreatment, neglect, abuse and misappropriation of
resident property to both the facility administrator and other officials in accordance
with State law (<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.13(c)(2)). The OIG also has established a provider
self-disclosure protocol that encourages providers voluntarily to report suspected fraud.
The concept of voluntary self-disclosure is premised on a recognition that the Government
alone cannot protect the integrity of the Medicare and other Federal health care programs.
Health care providers must be willing to police themselves, correct underlying problems,
and work with the Government to resolve these matters. The self-disclosure protocol can be
located on the OIG's web site at: <em>http://www.oig.hhs.gov</em>. </p>

<p><a name="N_109_">109. </a>The parameters of a claims review subject to an internal
investigation will depend on the circumstances surrounding the issues identified. By
limiting the scope of an internal audit to current billing, a nursing facility may fail to
discover major problems and deficiencies in operations, and it may be subject to certain
liability. </p>

<p><a name="N_110_">110. </a>Appropriate Federal and State authorities include the OIG,
the Criminal and Civil Divisions of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney in
relevant districts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the other investigative arms
for the agencies administering the affected Federal or State health care programs, such as
the State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the
Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Office of Personnel Management (which administers
the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program). <u>See</u> note 107. </p>

<p><a name="N_111_">111. </a>In contrast, to qualify for the &quot;not less than double
damages&quot; provision of the False Claims Act, the provider must provide the report to
the Government within 30 days after the date when the provider first obtained the
information. 31 U.S.C. 3729(a). </p>

<p><a name="N_112_">112. </a><sup>111</sup>Some violations may be so serious that they
warrant immediate notification to governmental authorities prior to, or simultaneous with,
commencing an internal investigation. By way of example, the OIG believes a provider
should report misconduct that: (1) is a clear violation of OIG administrative authorities,
civil fraud, or criminal laws; (2) has a significant adverse effect on the quality of care
provided to residents (in addition to any other legal obligations regarding quality of
care); or (3) indicates evidence of a systemic failure to comply with applicable laws or
an existing corporate integrity agreement, regardless of the financial impact on Federal
health care programs. </p>

<p><a name="N_113_">113. </a><sup>112</sup>The OIG has published criteria setting forth
those factors that the OIG takes into consideration in determining whether it is
appropriate to exclude a health care provider from program participation pursuant to 42
U.S.C. 1 320a-7(b)(7) for violations of various fraud and abuse laws. <u>See</u> 62 FR
67392 (December 24, 1997). </p>

<p><a name="N_114_">114. </a><sup>113</sup>A nursing facility should consult with its
Medicare fiscal intermediary (FI) and the appropriate sections of the PRM for additional
guidance regarding refunds under Medicare Part A. <u>See</u> note 101. The FI may require
certain information (<u>e.g.</u>, alleged violation or issue causing overpayment,
description of the internal investigative process with methodologies used to determine any
overpayments, and corrective actions taken, etc.) to be submitted with return of any
overpayments, and that such repayment information be submitted to a specific department or
individual. When appropriate, interest may be assessed on the overpayment. <u>See</u> 42
CFR 405.376. </p>

<p><a name="N_115_">115. </a><u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. 669. </p>

<p><a name="N_116_">116. </a>Evaluation may be accomplished through techniques 
  such as employee surveys, management assessments, and periodic review of benchmarks 
  established for audits, investigations, disciplinary action, overpayments, and 
  employee feedback. The nursing facility should evaluate all elements of its 
  compliance program, including policies, training, practices, and compliance 
  personnel. </p>
