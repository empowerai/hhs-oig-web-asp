  <strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> 
<p>   This compliance program guidance is intended to assist individual and small group physician
practices ("physician practices")<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in developing and implementing internal controls and
procedures that promote adherence to statutes and regulations applicable to the Federal health
care programs ("Federal health care program requirements") and private insurance program
requirements.  Compliance programs strengthen the efforts of Government and the private sector
to prevent and reduce improper conduct.  These programs can also further the mission of all
physician practices<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  to provide quality care to their patients. 

<p>   Many physicians have expressed an interest in better protecting their practices from the
potential for fraudulent or erroneous conduct through the implementation of compliance
programs.  While the Office of Inspector General (OIG) believes that the great majority of
physicians are honest and share our goal of protecting the integrity of Medicare and other
Federal health care programs, all health care providers have a duty to ensure that the claims
submitted to Federal health care programs are true and accurate.  The development of effective
compliance programs in physician practices will go a long way toward achieving this goal. 

<p>   Through this document, the OIG provides its views on the fundamental elements of physician
practice compliance programs, as well as the principles that each physician practice should
consider when developing and implementing an effective compliance program.  While this
document presents basic procedural and structural guidance for designing a compliance program,
it is not in and of itself a compliance program.  Rather, it is a set of guidelines that physician
practices should consider when developing and implementing a compliance program.  As stated
in previous guidance,<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> these guidelines are not mandatory.  Nor do they represent an exclusive
document of advisable elements of a compliance program.  They are a resource to be considered
in addition to other OIG outreach efforts, as well as other Federal agency efforts to promote
compliance.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Benefits of a Compliance Program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></strong>

<p>   The OIG believes that physician practices can gain numerous benefits by implementing an
effective compliance program.  These benefits may include:
<ul>
  <li>	the development of effective internal procedures to ensure compliance with
regulations, payment policies and coding rules;</li>
  <li>improved medical record documentation;</li>
  <li>improved education for practice employees;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;reduction in the denial of claims;</li>
  <li>more streamlined practice operations through better communication and more
comprehensive policies;</li>
  <li>the avoidance of potential liability arising from noncompliance;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;and reduced exposure to penalties.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> </li>
</ul>

<p>   An effective compliance program is essential for physician practices of all sizes and does not
have to be costly or resource-intensive.  With the development of a formal program, a physician
practice may find it easier to comply with its affirmative duty to ensure the accuracy of claims
submitted for reimbursement.

<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Application of Compliance Program Guidance</u></strong>

<p><strong>   </strong>The OIG recognizes that there is no "one size fits all" compliance program, especially for
physician practices.  The applicability of these recommendations will depend on the
circumstances of the particular physician practice.  Each practice should undertake reasonable
steps to respond to each of the seven basic elements of this guidance, depending on the size and
resources of that practice.

<p>   Compliance programs not only help to prevent fraudulent or erroneous claims, but they may
also show that the physician practice is making a good faith effort to submit claims
appropriately.  Physician practices should view compliance programs as analogous to practicing
preventive medicine.

<p> An effective compliance program also sends an important message to a physician 
  practice's employees that while the practice recognizes that mistakes will occur, 
  employees have an affirmative, ethical duty to come forward and report fraudulent 
  or erroneous conduct, so that it may be corrected. 
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Difference Between Fraudulent and "Erroneous" Claims To Federal Health
Programs</u></strong>

<p>   There appear to be significant misunderstandings among physicians regarding the critical
differences between fraudulent (intentionally or recklessly false) health care claims on the one
hand and innocent "erroneous" claims on the other.  Some physicians feel that Federal law
enforcement agencies have maligned medical professionals and are focused on innocent billing
errors.   These physicians are under the impression that innocent billing errors can subject them
to civil penalties, or even jail.   These feelings and impressions are mistaken.  

<p>   To these concerns, OIG would like to make the following points.  First, we do not disparage
physicians, other medical professionals or medical enterprises.  In our view, the great majority of
them are working ethically to render high quality medical care to our Medicare beneficiaries and
to submit proper claims to Medicare. 

<p>   Second, under the law, physicians are not subject to civil or criminal penalties for innocent
errors, or even negligence.  The Government's primary enforcement tool, the civil False Claims
Act, covers only offenses that are committed with <em>actual knowledge</em> of the falsity of the claim,
<em>reckless disregard</em>, or <em>deliberate ignorance</em> of the falsity of the claim.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  The False Claims Act
simply does not cover mistakes, errors, or negligence.  The other major civil remedy available to
the Federal Government, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, has exactly the same standard of
proof.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  OIG is very mindful of the difference between innocent errors ("erroneous claims") on
one hand, and reckless or intentional conduct ("fraudulent claims") on the other.   For criminal
penalties, the standard is even higher &#173; criminal intent to defraud must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.   The Attorney General of the United States has stated, "[i]t is not the [Justice
Department's] policy to punish honest billing mistakes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [or] mere negligence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  These are
not cases where we are seeking to punish someone for honest billing mistakes."<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 

<p>   Third, even ethical physicians (and their staffs) make billing mistakes and errors through
inadvertence or negligence.   When billing errors, honest mistakes, or negligence result in
erroneous claims, the physician practice will be asked to return the funds erroneously claimed,
but without penalties.   In other words, erroneous claims result only in the return of funds
claimed in error.  

<p>   Fourth, innocent billing errors are a significant drain on the programs and all parties
(physicians, providers, carriers, fiscal intermediaries, Government agencies, and beneficiaries)
need to work cooperatively to reduce the overall error rate.  But again, it should be emphasized
that civil or criminal penalty action will not be initiated with respect to billing errors due to
inadvertence or negligence, or for billings based on a negligent medical judgment.  

<p>   Finally, it is reasonable for physicians (and other providers) to ask:  what duty do they owe the
Federal health care programs?  The answer is that all health care providers have a duty to
reasonably ensure that the claims submitted to Medicare and other Federal health care programs
are true and accurate.  The OIG continues to engage the provider community in an extensive,
good faith effort to work cooperatively on voluntary compliance to minimize errors and to
prevent potential penalties for improper billings before they occur.  We encourage all physicians
and other providers to join in this effort.

<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong>

<p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Seven Basic Compliance Elements</u></strong>

<p>   The OIG believes that every effective compliance program should begin with a commitment
by the physician practice to address all of the applicable elements listed below, which are based
on the seven elements set forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines:<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 

<ol>
  <ol>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>establishing compliance standards through the development of a code of
conduct and written policies and procedures; </li>
      <li>assigning compliance monitoring efforts to a designated compliance
officer or contact;</li>
      <li>conducting comprehensive training and education on practice ethics and 
policies and procedures;</li>
      <li>conducting internal monitoring and auditing focusing on high-risk billing
and coding issues through performance of periodic audits;</li>
      <li>developing accessible lines of communication, such as discussions at staff
meetings regarding fraudulent or erroneous conduct issues and community
bulletin boards, to keep practice employees updated regarding compliance
activities;</li>
      <li>enforcing disciplinary standards by making clear or ensuring employees
are aware that compliance is treated seriously and that violations will be
dealt with consistently and uniformly; and</li>
      <li>responding appropriately to detected violations through the investigation
of allegations and the disclosure of incidents to appropriate Government
entities. </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>   The OIG recognizes that full implementation of all elements may not be feasible for all
physician practices.  However, as a first step, a good faith meaningful commitment to
compliance will substantially contribute to the program's successful implementation.  Smaller
practices should consider addressing each of the elements in a manner that best suits the practice. 
By contrast, larger practices should address the elements in a more systematic manner.  For
example, larger practices can use both this guidance and the Third-Party Medical Billing
Compliance Program Guidance to create a compliance program unique to the practice.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

<p> The OIG recognizes that physician practices need to find the best way to achieve 
  compliance for their given circumstances. Specifically, the OIG encourages physician 
  practices to participate in other compliance programs, such as the compliance 
  programs of the hospitals or other settings in which the physicians practice. 
  A physician's participation in another provider's compliance program could be 
  a way, at least partly, to satisfy recommended elements of the physician's or 
  physician practice's own compliance program. The OIG encourages this type of 
  collaborative effort, where the content is appropriate to the setting involved, 
  because it provides a means to promote the desired objective without imposing 
  an undue burden or requiring physicians to undertake duplicative action. 
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Written Policies and Procedures</u>

</strong>

<p>   Any effective compliance program should have compliance standards and procedures that will
be followed by the practice and that describe the lines of responsibility for implementing the
compliance program.  Those standards and procedures should be reasonably capable of reducing
the prospect of fraudulent activity while also helping to identify any incorrect billing practices.

<p><strong>1.  Code of Conduct</strong>

<p>   Developing standards of conduct is the first step to an effective compliance program.  A good
way to begin creating a standard of conduct for a physician practice is by looking at the
standards of conduct implemented by other physician practices and/or by requesting information
from professional associations to get ideas as to the items to include in a standard of conduct. 
However, it is important that the physician practice not simply copy another practice's standards. 
The standards of conduct for the physician practice should be specific to that practice.  This can
be accomplished by tailoring the standards of conduct to address the particularized needs of the
practice.

<p>   The practice's expectations with respect to billing and coding, patient care, documentation, and
payer relationships should be made clear to practice employees in the form of a code of conduct. 
This can also be succinctly stated in a practice mission statement.  For example, employees
should be told that the practice bills only for services that are actually rendered, codes
accurately, documents medical necessity and appropriateness, and adheres to all payer contracts. 

<p>   The concept of commitment to compliance is different from the mere existence of written
policies and procedures.  This commitment should be clearly established during training and in
the practice's policies.  Everyone in the practice should understand the obligation to comply with
the applicable standards.  They should be informed and understand that the organization will
take actions to uphold those standards.  Upon development, the code of conduct and policies
should be distributed and/or made continually available to all employees, contractors and agents,
once implemented.   These materials should be reviewed at least annually and revised as
necessary.

<p><strong>2.  Policies and Procedures</strong>

<p>   The code of conduct should be reinforced with basic policies reaffirming the key points in the
code of conduct.  The practice's policies should explain in clear and plain language the
procedures by which compliance measures are to be incorporated into standard operating
practices.

<p>   The OIG believes that written policies and procedures are essential to all physician practices,
regardless of size and capability.  If a lack of resources to develop such policies is genuinely an
issue, the OIG recommends that a physician practice focus first on those risk areas most likely to
arise in its particular practice.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  Additionally, if the physician practice relies on a physician
practice management company (PPMC) or management services organization (MSO), the
practice can incorporate the compliance policies of those entities, if appropriate, into its own
policies. 

<p>   Physician practices can meet the goal of developing policies and procedures by:  (1)
developing a written compliance manual; and (2) updating clinical forms periodically to make
sure they elicit the data required for the different levels of coding.  All written policies and
procedures should be tailored to the physician practice where they will be applied.

<p>   Areas in which a policy may be helpful to the practice include:
<ul>
  <li>employee hiring and retention;</li>
  <li>creation and maintenance of encounter forms, including the registration
form, history and physical form and charge master (superbill and patient
statement);&nbsp;</li>
  <li> coding and billing competency and responsibilities;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> correct coding initiatives;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> patient outreach and communication; and</li>
  <li> general marketing; and patient quality of care.</li>
</ul>

<p>   Creating a resource manual from publicly available information may be a cost-effective
approach for developing policies and procedures.  For example, the practice can develop a
"binder" that contains the practice's written policies and procedures, relevant HCFA directives
and carrier bulletins, and summaries of informative OIG documents (<em>e.g</em>., Special Fraud Alerts,
Advisory Opinions, inspection and audit reports).   This binder should be regularly updated and
should be accessible to all employees.  It could also include a summary of the relevant
reimbursement requirements of Federal and private payer plans (including those relating to
reasonable and necessary services, coding and documentation).<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>   In the case of more technical
materials, it may be advisable to provide summaries in the handbook and make the source
documents available upon request.  If individualized copies of this handbook are not made
available to all employees, then a reference copy should be available in a readily accessible
location.

<p>   If updates to the policies and procedures are necessary, those updates should be given to
employees.  New employees should receive both the code of conduct and policies when hired
and be trained on their contents immediately thereafter.  As part of the compliance effort, the
distribution of the code and policies should be documented.

<p><strong>3.  Specific Risk Areas</strong>

<p>   The OIG recognizes that many physician practices may not have in place policies and
procedures to prevent fraudulent or erroneous conduct in their practices.  In order to develop
policies and procedures, the physician practice should determine what types of fraud and abuse
related topics need to be addressed based on its specific needs.  One of the most important things
in making that determination is a listing of risk areas where the practice may be vulnerable.

<p>   To assist physician practices in performing this initial assessment, the OIG has developed a list
of potential risk areas affecting physician providers.  These risk areas include:  (a) coding and
billing; (b) reasonable and necessary services; (c) documentation and (d) improper inducements,
kickbacks and self-referrals.  This list of risk areas is not exhaustive, or all encompassing. 
Rather, it should be viewed as a starting point for an internal review of potential vulnerabilities
within the physician practice.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  The objective of such an assessment should be to ensure that key
personnel in the physician practice is aware of these risk areas and that steps are taken to
minimize, to the extent possible, the types of problems identified.  While there are many ways to
accomplish this objective, clear written policies and procedures that are communicated to all
employees are important to ensure the effectiveness of a compliance program.  Specifically, the
following are discussions of risk areas for physicians:<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coding and Billing</strong>

<p>   The identification of risk areas associated with coding and billing should be a major part of any
physician practice's compliance program. 

<p>   The following risk areas associated with billing have been among the most frequent subjects of
investigations and audits by the OIG:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>billing for items or services not rendered or not provided as claimed;<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			submitting claims for equipment, medical supplies and services that are
not reasonable and necessary;<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			double billing;<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			billing for non-covered services as if covered;</li>
  <li>			knowing misuse of provider identification numbers, which results in
improper billing;<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			billing for unbundled services;<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			failure to properly use coding modifiers;<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>	

  </li>
  <li>			upcoding the level of service provided.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>   The written policies and procedures concerning proper coding should reflect the current
reimbursement principles set forth in applicable statutes, regulations<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> and Federal, State or
private payer health care program requirements and should be developed in tandem with coding
and billing standards used in the physician practice.  Furthermore, written policies and
procedures should ensure that coding and billing are based on medical record documentation. 
Particular attention should be paid to issues of appropriate diagnosis codes and individual
Medicare Part B claims (including documentation guidelines for evaluation and management
services).<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  The physician practice should also institute a policy that all rejected claims
pertaining to diagnosis and procedure codes be reviewed by the coder.  This should facilitate a
reduction in similar errors.
<p><strong>	b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasonable and Necessary Services</strong>

<p>   The compliance program should provide guidance that claims be submitted only for services
that the physician practice finds to be reasonable and necessary in the particular case.  The OIG
recognizes that physicians should be able to order any tests, including screening tests, they
believe are appropriate for the treatment of their patients.  However, the physician practice
should be aware that Medicare will only pay for services that meet the Medicare definition of
reasonable and necessary.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>

<p> Medicare (and many insurance plans) may deny payment for a service that the 
  physician believes is clinically appropriate, but which is not reasonable and 
  necessary. Thus, when a physician provides services to a patient, he or she 
  should only bill those services believed to be reasonable and necessary for 
  the diagnosis and treatment of a patient. Upon request, the physician practice 
  should be able to provide documentation, such as a patient's medical records 
  and physician's orders, to support the appropriateness of a service that the 
  physician has provided. 
<p><strong>	c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation</strong>

<p>   Timely, accurate and complete documentation is critical to nearly every aspect of a physician
practice.  Therefore, one of the most important physician practice compliance issues is the
appropriate documentation of diagnosis and treatment.  Physician documentation is necessary to
determine the appropriate medical treatment for the patient and is the basis for coding and billing
determinations.  Most importantly, failure to document properly has the potential to compromise
good patient care.  Thorough and accurate documentation helps to ensure accurate recording and
timely transmission of information.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i. Medical Record Documentation

<p>   In addition to facilitating high quality patient care, a properly documented medical record
verifies and documents precisely what services were actually provided.  The medical record may
be used to validate:  (a) the site of the service; (b) the appropriateness of the services provided;
and (c) the accuracy of the billing.  Accurate medical record documentation should comply, at a
minimum, with the following principles:<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>

<ul>
  <li>		The medical record should be complete and legible;</li>
  <li>		The documentation of each patient encounter should include the reason for
the encounter; any relevant history; physical examination findings; prior
diagnostic test results; assessment, clinical impression, or diagnosis; plan
of care; and date and legible identity of the observer;</li>
  <li>		If not documented, the rationale for ordering diagnostic and other
ancillary services should be easily inferred by an independent reviewer or
third party.  Past and present diagnoses should be accessible to the treating
and/or consulting physician; and</li>
  <li>		Appropriate health risk factors should be identified.  The patient's
progress, his or her response to, and any changes in, treatment, and any
revision in diagnosis should be documented.</li>
</ul>

<p>   The CPT and ICD-9-CM codes reported on the health insurance claims form should be
supported by documentation in the medical record and the medical chart should contain all
required information.  Additionally, HCFA and the local carriers should be able to determine
who provided the services.  These issues can be the root of investigations of inappropriate or
erroneous conduct, and have been identified by HCFA and OIG as a leading cause of
inappropriate payments.  

<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  ii. HCFA 1500 Form 
<p>   Another documentation area that physician practices should monitor closely is the proper
completion of the HCFA 1500 form.  The following practices will help ensure that the form has
been properly completed:

<ul>
  <li>			link the diagnosis code with the steps taken to perform an
examination and the record of personal history obtained;</li>
  <li>			link a single most appropriate diagnosis with the corresponding
procedure code;</li>
  <li>			use modifiers appropriately; and</li>
  <li>			provide Medicare with all information about a patient's other
insurance coverage.			</li>
</ul>
<strong>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kickbacks, Inducements and Self-Referrals</strong>

<p>   A physician practice should have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-kickback statute,<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> and the physician self-referral law.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  Remuneration for referrals is illegal
because it can distort medical decision-making, cause overutilization of services or supplies,
increase costs to Federal health care programs, and result in unfair competition by shutting out
competitors who are unwilling to pay it.  Remuneration for referrals can also affect the quality of
patient care by encouraging physicians to order services or supplies based on profit rather than
the patients' best medical interests.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>

<p>   In particular, arrangements with hospitals, hospices, nursing facilities, home health agencies,
durable medical equipment suppliers and vendors are areas of potential concern.  In general the
anti-kickback statute prohibits knowing and willfully giving or receiving anything of value to
induce referrals of Federal health care program business.  It is generally recommended that all
business arrangements wherein physician practices refer business to an outside entity should be
on a <em>fair market value</em> basis.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  Whenever a physician practice intends to enter into a business
arrangement that involves its making referrals, the arrangement should be reviewed by counsel
familiar with the anti-kickback statute and physician self-referral statute.
<p>   In addition to developing policies to address arrangements with other health care providers and
suppliers, physician practices should implement measures to avoid offering inappropriate
inducements to patients.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  Examples of such inducements include routinely waiving coinsurance
or deductible amounts without a good faith determination that the patient is in financial need or
failing to make reasonable efforts to collect the cost-sharing amount.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  

<p>   Possible risk areas that should be addressed in the policies and procedures include:

<ul>
  <li>			financial arrangements with outside entities to whom the practice may
refer Federal health care program business;<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

  </li>
  <li>			joint ventures with entities supplying goods or services to the physician
practice or its patients;<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> 

  </li>
  <li>			consulting contracts or medical directorship;</li>
  <li>			office and equipment leases with entities to which the physician refers;
and</li>
  <li>	soliciting, accepting or offering any gift or gratuity of more than nominal
value to or from those who may benefit from a physician practice's
referral of Federal health care program business.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>   In order to keep current with this area of the law, a physician practice may obtain copies,
available on the OIG website, of all relevant OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions
that address the application of the anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws to ensure that
the policies reflect current positions and opinions.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> 

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention of Records</strong>

<p>   A physician practice's policies and procedures should also contain a section on the retention of
compliance, business and medical records.  These records primarily include documents relating
to patient care and the practice's business activities.  The physician practice's designated
compliance officer should keep an updated binder or record of compliance-related activities. 
This involves, at a minimum, keeping track of compliance meetings, educational activities, and
internal audit results.  Particular attention should be paid to documenting violations uncovered
by the compliance program and the resulting remedial action.
<p>   Physician practices that implement a compliance program should provide for the development
and implementation of a records retention system.  This system should establish policies and
procedures regarding the creation, distribution, retention, and destruction of documents.  In
designing a record system, privacy concerns and Federal and State regulatory requirements
should be taken into consideration.  In addition to maintaining appropriate and thorough medical
records on each patient, the OIG recommends that the system include the following types of
documents:

<ul>
  <li>	all records and documentation (<em>e.g.</em>, billing and claims documentation) required
for participation in Federal, State, and private payer health care programs; and</li>
  <li>	all records necessary to demonstrate the integrity of the physician practice's
compliance process and to confirm the effectiveness of the program.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<a name="records"></a>
<p>   While conducting its compliance activities, as well as its daily operations, a physician practice
should document its efforts to comply with applicable Federal health care program requirements. 
For example, when a physician practice requests advice from a Government agency (including a
Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier) charged with administering a Federal health care
program, the practice should document and retain a record of the request and any written or oral
response.  This step is extremely important if the practice intends to rely on that response to
guide it in future decisions, actions, or claim reimbursement requests or appeals.  A log of oral
inquiries between the practice and third parties, such as carrier representatives, will help the
practice document its attempts at compliance.  In addition, in a subsequent investigation these
records may become relevant to the issue of whether the practice's reliance was "reasonable"
and whether it exercised due diligence in developing procedures and practices to implement the
advice.

<p>   In short, all physician practices, regardless of size, should have procedures to create and retain
appropriate documentation.  The following record retention guidelines should be followed:

<ol>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>	The length of time that a physician's medical record documentation is to
be retained should be specified in the physician practice's policies and
procedures (Federal and State statutes should be consulted for specific
time frames);</li>
    <li>	Medical records should be secured against loss, destruction, unauthorized
access, unauthorized reproduction, corruption, or damage; and</li>
    <li>	Policies and procedures should stipulate the disposition of medical records
in the event the practice is sold or closed.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Designation of a Compliance Officer/Contact</u>

</strong>

<p>   To administer the compliance program, the practice should designate an individual who is
responsible for overseeing the compliance program.  This person, often called a "compliance
officer," may have duties in addition to serving in this role.  This person could be the office
manager or the primary biller.  The key, however, is that the person be sufficiently independent
in his or her position so as to protect against any conflicts of interest that may arise from
performing  assigned duties and compliance duties.  Additional attributes and qualifications that
this person should possess include:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>attention to detail;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>	experience in billing and coding;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>and effective communication skills, both oral and written, with employees,
physicians and carriers.</li>
</ul>

      <p>It is acceptable for a physician practice to designate more than one employee with compliance
monitoring responsibility.  In lieu of having a designated compliance officer, the physician
practice could instead describe in its policies and procedures the compliance functions for which
designated employees, known as "compliance contacts," would be responsible.  For example,
one employee could be responsible for preparing written policies and procedures, while another
could be responsible for conducting or arranging for periodic audits and ensuring that billing
questions are answered.  Therefore, the compliance-related responsibilities of the designated
person or persons may be only a portion of his or her duties.</p>

<p>   Another possibility is that one individual could serve as compliance officer for more than one
entity.  In situations where staffing limitations mandate that the practice cannot afford to
designate a person(s) to oversee compliance activities, the practice could outsource all or part of
the functions of a compliance officer to a third party, such as a consultant, PPMC, MSO,
Independent Physician Association, billing company or professional association.  However, if
this role is outsourced, the compliance officer should have sufficient interaction with the
physician practice to be able to effectively serve as the compliance officer.  Outsourced
compliance officers, who spend most of their time offsite, will naturally have certain limitations
that a physician practice should consider before making such a critical decision.

<p>   The primary responsibilities assigned to a compliance officer/contact should include the
following:
<ul>
  <li>overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance
program;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>establishing methods, such as periodic audits, to improve the practice's
efficiency and quality of services, and to reduce the practice's
vulnerability to fraud and abuse;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		periodically revising the compliance program in light of changes in the
needs of the practice or changes in the law and in the policies and
procedures of Government and private payer health plans;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		developing, coordinating and participating in a training program that
focuses on the elements of the compliance program, and seeks to ensure
that training materials are appropriate;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		ensuring that the HHS-OIG's List of Excluded Individuals and Entities,
and the General Services Administration's List of Parties Debarred from
Federal Programs have been checked with respect to all employees,
medical staff and independent contractors;<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> &nbsp;</li>
  <li>		ensuring that employees and physicians know, and comply with, pertinent
Federal and State statutes, regulations and standards;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;investigating any report or allegation concerning possible unethical or
improper business practices, and monitoring subsequent corrective action
and/or compliance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>	


Each physician practice needs to assess its own practice situation and determine what best suits
that practice in terms of compliance oversight.</p>
    <p><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conducting Effective Training and Education</u></strong>
Education is an important part of any compliance program.  Education programs should be
tailored to the physician practice's needs and include both compliance and specific training. 
Training expectations should be commensurate with the size and speciality of the practice.</p>

<p>   There are three basic steps for setting up educational objectives:

<ol>
  <ol>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>determining who needs training (both in coding and billing and in
compliance);</li>
      <li>determining the type of training that best suits the practice's needs (<em>e.g.</em>,
seminars, in-service training, self-study or other programs); and</li>
      <li>determining when the education is needed and how much each person
should receive.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>   Training can be accomplished through a variety of means, including in-person training
sessions (<em>i.e.</em>, either on site or at outside seminars), distribution of newsletters,<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> or even a readily
accessible office bulletin board.  Regardless of the training modality used, a physician practice
should ensure that the necessary education is communicated effectively.  Simply providing
individuals with documents for their own reading and comprehension is seldom sufficient.

<p><strong>1.  Compliance Training</strong>

<p>   Under the direction of the designated compliance officer/contact, both initial and recurrent
training in compliance is advisable, both with respect to the compliance program itself and
applicable statutes and regulations.  The operation and importance of the compliance program,
the consequences of violating the policies set forth in the program, and the role of each employee
in the operation of the compliance program should also be addressed.

<p>   Compliance training should have two goals:  (1) all employees should receive training on how
to perform their jobs in compliance with the standards of the practice and any applicable
regulations; and (2) each employee should understand that compliance is a condition of
continued employment.  Compliance training should center on explaining why the practice is
developing and establishing a code of conduct and written policies and procedures.  The training
should emphasize that following the policies will not get a practice employee in trouble, but
violating the policies will.  New employees should be trained on the compliance program within
60 days of their start date and such training should be documented.  Thereafter, employees
should receive refresher training on an annual basis or as appropriate.

<p><strong>2.  Coding and Billing Training</strong>

<p>   Coding and billing training on the Federal health care program requirements may be necessary
for certain members of the physician practice staff depending on their respective responsibilities. 
Individuals who are directly involved with billing, coding or other aspects of the Federal health
care programs should receive extensive education specific to that individual's responsibilities. 
Items to cover in coding and billing training can include:
    <ul type="disc">
  <li>coding requirements;</li>
  <li>		claim development and submission processes;</li>
  <li>		marketing practices that reflect current legal and program standards;</li>
  <li>		the ramifications of submitting a claim for physician services when
rendered by a non-physician;</li>
  <li>		signing a form for a physician without the physician's authorization;</li>
  <li>		the ramifications of altering medical records;</li>
  <li>		proper documentation of services rendered;</li>
  <li>		how to report misconduct;</li>
  <li>		proper billing standards and procedures and submission of accurate bills
for services or items rendered to Federal health care program
beneficiaries;</li>
  <li>		the personal obligation of each person involved in the billing process to
ensure claims are properly and accurately submitted;</li>
  <li>		the legal sanctions for submitting deliberately false or reckless billings;</li>
  <li>		informing physicians that they cannot receive payment or any type of
incentive to induce referrals and that claims should not be submitted for
physician services when those services are rendered by a non-physician
(unless they follow the applicable Federal health care program
requirements, <em>e.g.</em>, "incident to" rules).</li>

    </ul>

<p><strong>3.  Format of the Training Program</strong>

<p>   Training may be conducted either in-house or by an outside source.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  Training at outside
seminars, instead of internal programs and in-service sessions, can be an effective way to
achieve the practice's training goals.  In fact, many community colleges offer certificate or
associate degree programs in billing and coding, and professional associations provide various
kinds of continuing education and certification programs.  Many carriers also offer billing
training.

<p>   As part of the training, practices should make sure all employees are familiar with at least the
key risk areas in this guidance and areas of particular OIG interest as identified in the OIG's
Work Plan published each year.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  The physician practice also needs to work with its third-party
billing company, if one is used, to ensure that documentation is of a level that is adequate for the
billing company to submit accurate claims on behalf of the physician practice.  If it is not, these
problem areas should also be covered in the training.  In addition to the billing training,
physician practices should be certain that updated ICD-9, HCPCS and CPT manuals (in addition
to the carrier bulletins construing those sources) are available to all employees involved in the
billing process.  A source of continuous updates on current billing policies should also be readily
available.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a> 	

<p>   Physician practices are not required to have separate education and training programs for both
the compliance and coding and billing training.  All in-service training and continuing education
can integrate compliance issues, as well as other core values adopted by the practice, such as
quality improvement and improved patient service, into their curriculum.

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing Education on Compliance Issues</strong>

<p>There is no set formula for determining how often training sessions should occur.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>   The OIG
recommends that there be at least an annual training program for all individuals involved in the
coding and billing aspects of the practice.   New billing and coding employees should be trained
within 60 days of assuming their duties and should work under an experienced employee until
their training has been completed.
    <p><strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Developing Effective Lines of Communication</u></strong>

<p>   An open line of communication is essential to proper implementation of an effective
compliance program.  Guidance previously issued by the OIG has encouraged the use of several
forms of communication between the compliance officer/committee and provider personnel,
many of which focus on formal processes and are more costly to implement (<em>e.g.</em>, hotlines and
e-mail).  However, the OIG recognizes that the nature of some physician practices is not as
conducive to implementing these types of measures.  The nature of a small physician practice
dictates that such communication and information exchanges need to be conducted through a
less formalized process than that which has been envisioned by prior OIG guidance.

<p>   In the small physician practice setting, the communication element can be met by
implementing a clear "open door" policy between the physicians and compliance personnel and
practice employees.  This policy can be implemented in conjunction with less formal
communication techniques, such as conspicuous notices posted in common areas and/or the
development and placement of a compliance bulletin board where everyone in the practice can
go for up-to-date compliance information.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>  

<p>   A compliance program's system for effective communication should include the following:
<ul>
  <li>		the requirement that employees report conduct that a reasonable person
would, in good faith, believe to be fraudulent or erroneous;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>creation of a user-friendly process, such as an anonymous drop box, for
effectively reporting fraudulent or erroneous conduct;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>provisions in the policies and procedures that state that a failure to report
fraudulent or erroneous conduct is a violation of the compliance program;</li>
  <li>development of a simple and readily accessible procedure to process
reports of fraudulent or erroneous conduct;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;utilization of a process that maintains the confidentiality of the persons
involved in the alleged fraudulent or erroneous conduct and the person
making the allegation; and</li>
  <li>&nbsp;provisions in the policies and procedures that there will be no retribution
for reporting conduct that a reasonable person acting in good faith would
have believed to be fraudulent or erroneous.</li>
</ul>

<p>   The OIG recognizes that protecting anonymity may be infeasible for small physician practices. 
However, the OIG believes all practice employees, when seeking answers to questions or
reporting potential instances of fraudulent or erroneous conduct, should know to whom to turn
for assistance in these matters and should be able to do so without fear of retribution.  While the
physician practice should always strive to maintain the confidentiality of an employee's identity,
it should also make clear that there may be a point at which the individual's identity may become
known or may have to be revealed in certain instances.

<p><strong>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Auditing and Monitoring</u></strong>

<p>   An ongoing evaluation process is important to a successful compliance program.  This ongoing
evaluation should include not only whether the practice's standards and procedures are in fact
current and accurate, but also whether or not the compliance program is effective, <em>i.e.</em>, whether
individuals are properly carrying out their responsibilities and claims are submitted
appropriately.<br>
<br>
<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policies and Procedures</b>

<p>   It is recommended that the individual(s) in charge of the compliance program also be charged
with the responsibility of periodically reviewing the policies and procedures to see if they arecurrent and complete.  If the policies and procedures are found to be ineffective or outdated, they
should be updated to reflect changes in CPT codes and Government regulations.&nbsp;

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claims Submission Audit</strong>

<p>   In addition to the policies and procedures themselves, bills and medical records should be
reviewed for compliance with applicable coding, billing and documentation requirements.  The
people involved in these self-audits should include the person in charge of billing compliance
and a medically trained person (<em>e.g.</em>, registered nurse or preferably a physician (physicians can
rotate in this position)).  Each practice needs to decide for itself whether to review claims
retrospectively or concurrently with the claims submission.  In the Third-Party Medical Billing
Compliance Program Guidance,<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> the OIG recommended that a baseline, or "snapshot," be used
as part of the benchmarking analysis that would enable a practice to judge its progress in
reducing or eliminating potential areas of vulnerability.&nbsp;

<p>   The practice's self-audits should be used to determine whether:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li> bills are accurately coded and accurately reflect the services provided;</li>
  <li>services or items provided are reasonable and necessary;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>any incentives for unnecessary services exist; and</li>
  <li>medical records contain sufficient documentation to support the charge.</li>
</ul>

<p>   A baseline audit should examine the claim development and submission process, from patient
intake through claim submission and payment, and identify elements within this process that
may contribute to non-compliance or that may need to be the focus for improving execution.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a> 
This audit should establish a consistent methodology for selecting and examining records, and
this methodology should serve as a basis for future audits.  It should be conducted based on
claims submitted during the initial three months after implementation of the education and
training program so as to give the physician practice a benchmark against which to measure
future compliance effectiveness.

<p>   Following the baseline audit, periodic audits could be conducted at least once each year to
ensure that the compliance program is being followed.  A randomly selected number of medical
records could be reviewed to ensure that the coding was performed accurately.  Although there is
no set formula to how many medical records should be reviewed, a basic guide is two to five
medical records per payer, or five to ten medical records per physician.  Of course, the larger the
sample size, the greater the confidence in the results.  If problems are identified, focused review
should be conducted on a more frequent basis.  When audit results reveal areas needing
additional information or education of employees and physicians, these areas should be
incorporated into the training and educational system.

<p>   Periodic audits could include the following:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>		a valid sample of the practice's top ten denials, or the practice's top ten
services provided;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		confirmation that the physician practice has been using specific codes, as
some codes are too general for "reasonable and necessary" purposes;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;a check for data entry errors;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		confirmation that all orders are written and signed by a physician;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>		a check for reasonable and necessary services performed; confirmation that all tests ordered by the physician(s) were actually
performed and documented and that only those tests were billed; and</li>
  <li>&nbsp;and a review of assignment codes and modifiers to the claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important elements of a successful billing compliance program is appropriate
action when the physician practice identifies a problem in its internal audit.  This action should
be taken as soon as possible, but it is recommended that the action be taken within 60 days from
the date the problem is identified.  The specific action a physician practice takes should depend
on the circumstances of the situation it has identified.  In some cases, the action can be as simple
as generating a repayment to Medicare or the appropriate payer.  Alternatively, the repayment
could be effectuated through offsets to other billings, such as undercodings.  In others, the
physician practice may want to seek legal advice and/or consult with a coding/billing expert to
determine the next best course of action.  There is no boilerplate solution to how to handle
problems that are identified.</p>

<p>   It is important that the physician practice monitor its billing program to ensure claims are
correctly submitted.  If a physician practice identifies, through its internal audits, what it believes
is a potential problem, there should be sufficient confidence in the compliance procedures
developed by the physician practice to reasonably believe that the problem is in fact a potential
issue.  Steps should be taken to remedy the situation immediately.

<p>   All physician practices should create a system to address how they will respond to and report
potential problems.  In addition, preserving information relating to identification of the problem
is as important as preserving information that tracks the physician practice's reaction to, and
solution for, the issue.
<p><b>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Enforcing Standards Through Well-Publicized Disciplinary Guidelines</u></b>

<p>   An effective physician practice compliance program includes procedures for enforcing and
disciplining individuals who violate the practice's compliance standards.  Enforcement and
disciplinary provisions are necessary to put teeth into a compliance program.

<p>   A physician practice's enforcement and disciplinary mechanisms should ensure that violations
of the practice's compliance policies will result in consistent and appropriate sanctions,
including the possibility of termination, against the offending individual.  At the same time, the
practice's enforcement and disciplinary procedures should be flexible enough to account for
mitigating or aggravating circumstances.  The program should also stipulate that individuals who
fail to detect or report violations of the compliance program may also be subject to discipline. 
Disciplinary actions could include:  warnings (oral); reprimands (written); probation; demotion;
temporary suspension; discharge of employment; restitution of damages; and referral for
criminal prosecution. Inclusion of disciplinary guidelines in in-house training and procedure
manuals is sufficient to meet the "well publicized" standard of this element.

<p>   Any communication resulting in the finding of non-compliant conduct should be documented
in the compliance files by including the date of incident, name of the reporting party, name of
the person responsible for taking action, and the follow-up action taken.  Physician practices
should also conduct checks to make sure all current and potential practice employees are not
listed on the OIG or GSA lists of individuals excluded from participation in Federal health care
or Government procurement programs.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)<br>
</sup></a>

    <p><b>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Responding To Detected Offenses and Developing Corrective Action Initiatives</u></b>

<p>   Violations of a physician practice's compliance program, significant failures to comply with
applicable Federal or State law, and other types of misconduct threaten a practice's status as a
reliable, honest, and trustworthy provider of health care.  Fraudulent or erroneous conduct that
has been detected, but not corrected, can seriously endanger the reputation and legal status of the
practice.  Consequently, upon receipt of reports or reasonable indications of suspected
noncompliance, it is important that the compliance officer or other practice employee investigate
the allegations to determine whether a material violation of applicable law or the requirements of
the compliance program has occurred, and, if so, take decisive steps to correct the problem.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>  As
appropriate, such steps may include a corrective action plan,<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> the return of any overpayments, a
report to the Government,<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> and/or a referral to law enforcement authorities.

<p>   There are several key warning signs of when a compliance program is not working well, e.g.,
high rates of rejected and/or suspended claims and the placement of a practice on pre-payment
review by the carrier.  These warning signs should be followed up on immediately and the
compliance procedures of the practice changed to prevent the problem from recurring.  	

<p>   As previously stated, the physician practice should take appropriate corrective action,
including prompt identification of any overpayment to the affected payer.  A knowing and
willful failure to disclose overpayments within a reasonable period of time could be interpreted
as an attempt to conceal the overpayment from the Government, thereby establishing an
independent basis for a criminal violation with respect to the physician practice, as well as any
individual who may have been involved.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>   For this reason, physician practice compliance
programs should emphasize that overpayments should be promptly disclosed and returned to the
entity that made the erroneous payment. 

<p>   After an offense has been detected, a physician or group practice should take all reasonable
steps to respond to the offense and to prevent similar offenses.  The compliance program should
provide for a full internal investigation of all reports of detected violations.  The goodwill that
physicians generate by developing an effective compliance program will quickly dissipate if the
physician ignores reports of possible fraudulent activity.

<p>   The compliance program procedures should include provisions to ensure that a violation is not
compounded once discovered.  The individuals involved in the violation should either be
retrained, or, if appropriate, terminated.  The physician practice may also prevent the
compounding of the violation by conducting a review of all confirmed violations, and, if
appropriate, self-reporting the violations to the applicable authority.  This should be done within
90 days of the discovery of a violation. 

<p>   The physician practice should recognize that if a violation occurred and was not immediately
detected, its compliance program may require modification.  Physicians who detect violations
should analyze the situation to determine whether a flaw in their compliance program failed to
anticipate the detected problem, or whether the compliance program's procedures failed to
prevent the violation.  In any event, it is prudent, even absent the detection of any violations, for
physician practices to periodically review and modify their compliance programs.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION</b>

<p>   Just as immunizations are given to patients to prevent them from becoming ill, physician
practices should view the implementation of an effective compliance program as comparable to a
form of preventive medicine to protect against fraudulent or erroneous conduct.  This
compliance program guidance is intended to assist physician practices in developing and
implementing internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to Federal health care
program and private insurance program requirements.  By implementing an effective compliance
program, physician practices can help prevent and reduce fraudulent or erroneous conduct in
their practices, as well as furthering their mission to provide quality care to their patients.<br>
<p align="center"><b>APPENDIX A:  ADDITIONAL RISK AREAS&nbsp;</b>
<p align="left">
<b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reasonable and Necessary Services</u></b>

<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Local Medical Review Policy</b></i>

<p>An area of concern relating to determinations of reasonable and necessary services is the
variation in local medical review policies (LMRPs) among carriers.  Physicians are supposed to
bill the Federal health care programs only for items and services that are reasonable and
necessary.  However, in order to determine whether an item or service is reasonable and
necessary under Medicare guidelines, the physician must apply the appropriate
LMRP.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>	

<p>Physician practices are to bill the Federal health programs only for items and services that are
covered.  In order to determine if an item or service is covered for Medicare, physician practices
must be knowledgeable of the LMRPs applicable to their practices jurisdiction.  When the
LMRP indicates that an item or service may not be covered by Medicare, the physician practice
is responsible to convey this information to the patient so that the patient can make an informed
decision concerning the health care services he/she may want to receive.  Physician practices
convey this information through Advanced Beneficiary Notices (ABNs).
<p>	<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Advanced Beneficiary Notices</b></i>
<p>Physicians are required to provide ABNs before they provide services that they know or believe
Medicare does not consider reasonable and necessary.  A properly executed ABN acknowledges
that coverage is uncertain or yet to be determined, and stipulates that the patient promises to pay
the bill if Medicare does not.  Patients who are not notified before they receive such services are
not responsible for payment.  The ABN must be sufficient to put the patient on notice of the
reasons why the physician believes that the payment may be denied.  The objective is to give the
patient sufficient information to allow an informed choice as to whether to pay for the service.
<p>Accordingly, each ABN should:
<p>1.  be in writing;<br>
2.  identify the specific service that may be denied (procedure name and CPT/HCPC code is
recommended);<br>
3.  state the specific reason why the physician believes that service may be denied; and<br>
4.  be signed by the patient acknowledging that the required information was provided and that
the patient assumes responsibility to pay for the service.
<p>The <u> Medicare Carrier's Manual</u><a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a> provides that an ABN will not be acceptable if:  (1) the patient
is asked to sign a blank ABN form; and (2) the ABN is used routinely without regard to a
particularized need.  The routine use of ABNs is generally prohibited because the ABN must
state the specific reason the physician anticipates that the specific service will not be covered.
<p>A common risk area associated with ABNs is in regard to diagnostic tests or services.  There are
four steps that a physician practice can take to help ensure it is in compliance with the
regulations concerning ABNs for diagnostic tests or services:
<p>1.  determine which tests are not covered under national coverage rules;<br>
2.  determine which tests are not covered under local coverage rules such as LMRPs (contact the
practice's carrier to see if a listing has been assembled); and<br>
3.  determine which tests are only covered for certain diagnoses.
<p>The OIG is aware that the use of ABNs is an area where physician practices experience
numerous difficulties.  Practices can help to reduce problems in this area by educating their
physicians on the correct use of ABNs, obtaining guidance from the carrier regarding their
interpretation of whether an ABN is necessary where the service is not covered, developing a
standard form for all diagnostic tests (most carriers have a developed model), and developing a
process for handling patients who refuse to sign ABNs.
<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Physician Liability for Certifications in the Provision of Medical Equipment and Supplies and Home Health Services</i></b>
<p>In January 1999, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on this topic, which is available on the
OIG website at www.hhs.gov/oig/frdalrt/index.htm.  The following is a summary of the Special
Fraud Alert.
<p>The OIG issued the Special Fraud Alert to reiterate to physicians the legal and programmatic
significance of physician certifications made in connection with the ordering of certain items and
services for Medicare patients.  In light of information obtained through OIG provider audits, the
OIG deemed it necessary to remind physicians that they may be subject to criminal, civil, and
administrative penalties for signing a certification when they know that the information is false
or for signing a certification with reckless disregard as to the truth of the information.  (See
Appendix B and Appendix C for more detailed information on the applicable statutes).
<p>Medicare has conditioned payment for many items and services on a certification signed by a
physician attesting that the physician has reviewed the patient's condition and has determined
that an item or service is reasonable and necessary.  Because Medicare primarily relies on the
professional judgment of the treating physician to determine the reasonable and necessary nature
of a given service or supply, it is important that physicians provide complete and accurate
information on any certifications they sign.  Physician certification is obtained through a variety
of forms, including prescriptions, orders, and Certificates of Medical Necessity (CMNs).  Two
areas where physician certification as to whether an item or service is reasonable and necessary
is essential and which can result in fraudulent or erroneous conduct are:  (1) home health
services; and (2) durable medical equipment.
<p>By signing a CMN, the physician represents that:
<p>1.  he or she is the patient's treating physician and that the information regarding the
physician's address and unique physician identification number (UPN) is correct;<br>
2.  the entire CMN, including the sections filled out by the supplier, was completed
prior
to the physician's signature; and<br>
3.  the information in section B relating to whether the item or service is reasonable and
necessary is true, accurate, and complete to the best of the physician's knowledge.
<p>Activities such as signing blank CMNs, signing CMNs without seeing the patient to verify the
item or service is reasonable and necessary, and signing a CMN for a service that the physician
knows is not reasonable and necessary are activities that can lead to criminal, civil and
administrative penalties.
<p>Ultimately, physicians should be sure to carefully review any form of certification (order,
prescription or CMN) before signing it to verify that the information contained in the
certification is both complete and accurate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Billing for Non-Covered Services as if Covered</i></b>
<p>In some instances, we are aware that physician practices submit claims for services in order to
receive a denial from the carrier, thereby enabling the patient to submit the denied claim for
payment to a secondary payer.
<p>A common question relating to this risk is:  If the medical services provided are not covered
under Medicare, but the secondary or supplemental insurer requires a Medicare rejection in order
to cover the services, then would the original submission of the claim to Medicare be considered
fraudulent?  Under the applicable regulations, the OIG would not consider such submissions to
be fraudulent.  For example, the denial may be necessary to establish patient liability protections
as stated in section 1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act) (codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395pp).  As
stated, Medicare denials may also be required so that the patient can seek payment from a
secondary insurer.  In instances where a claim is being submitted to Medicare for this purpose,
the physician should indicate on the claim submission that the claim is being submitted for the
purpose of receiving a denial, in order to bill a secondary insurance carrier.  This step should
assist carriers and prevent inadvertent payments to which the physician is not entitled.  In some
instances, however, the carrier pays the claim even though the service is non-covered, and even
though the physician did not intend for payment to be made.  When this occurs, the physician
has a responsibility to refund the amount paid and indicate that the service is not covered.
<p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Physician Relationships with Hospitals</u></b>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Physician Role in The Patient Anti-Dumping Statute</b></i>
<p>The Patient Anti-Dumping Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1395dd, is an area that has been receiving
increasing scrutiny.  The statute is intended to ensure that all patients who come to the
emergency department of a hospital receive care, regardless of their insurance or ability to pay. 
Both hospitals and physicians need to work together to ensure compliance with the provisions of
this law.
<p>The statute imposes three fundamental requirements upon hospitals that participate in the
Medicare program with regard to patients requesting emergency care.  First, the hospital must
conduct an appropriate medical screening examination to determine if an emergency medical
condition exists.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>  Second, if the hospital determines that an emergency medical condition exists,
it must either provide the treatment necessary to stabilize the emergency medical condition or
comply with the statute's requirements to effect a proper transfer of a patient whose condition
has not been stabilized.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  A hospital is considered to have met this second requirement if an
individual refuses the hospital's offer of additional examination or treatment, or refuses to
consent to a transfer, after having been informed of the risks and benefits.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>

<p>If an individual's emergency medical condition has not been stabilized, the statute's third
requirement is activated.  A hospital may not transfer an individual with an unstable emergency
medical condition unless:  (1) the individual or his or her representative makes a written request
for transfer to another medical facility after being informed of the risk of transfer and the
transferring hospital's obligation under the statute to provide additional examination or
treatment; (2) a physician has signed a certification summarizing the medical risks and benefits
of a transfer and certifying that, based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the
medical benefits reasonably expected from the transfer outweigh the increased risks; or (3) if a
physician is not physically present when the transfer decision is made, a qualified medical
person signs the certification after the physician, in consultation with the qualified medical
person, has made the determination that the benefits of transfer outweigh the increased risks. 
The physician must later countersign the certification.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>

<p>Physician and/or hospital misconduct may result in violations of the statute.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  One area of
particular concern is physician on-call responsibilities.  Physician practices whose members
serve as on-call emergency room physicians with hospitals should make sure they are familiar
with the hospital's policies regarding on-call physicians.  This can be done by reviewing the
medical staff bylaws or policies and procedures of the hospital that must define the responsibility
of on-call physicians to respond to, examine, and treat patients with emergency medical
conditions.  Physicians should also be aware that, in most cases, on-call physicians must come to
the hospital to examine the patient when a request is made for their services.  If, however, their
offices are located in a hospital-owned facility on contiguous land or on the hospital campus, the
patient may be seen in the physician's office.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teaching Physicians</b></i></p>
<p>Special regulations apply to teaching physicians' billings.  Regulations provide that services
provided by teaching physicians in teaching settings are payable under the physician fee
schedule only if the services are personally furnished by a physician who is not a resident or the
services are furnished by a resident in the presence of a teaching physician.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>

<p>The teaching physician must be present during the key portion of any service or procedure for
which payment is sought.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>  Physicians should ensure the following with respect to services
provided in the teaching physician setting:<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<p>1.  Only services actually provided are billed;<br>
2.  Every physician who provides or supervises the provision of services to a patient is
responsible for the correct documentation of the services that were rendered;<br>
3.  Every physician is responsible for assuring that in cases where the physician provides
evaluation and management (E&amp;M) services, a patient's medical record includes appropriate
documentation of the applicable key components of the E&amp;M services provided or supervised by
the physician (e.g., patient history, physician examination, and medical decision making), as
well as documentation to adequately reflect the procedure or portion of the services provided by
the physician; and<br>
4.  Every physician must document his or her presence during the key portion of any service or
procedure for which payment is sought.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gainsharing Arrangements and Civil Monetary Penalties for</i>  <i>Hospital
Payments to Physicians to Reduce or Limit Services to Beneficiaries</i></b>
<p>In July 1999, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on this topic, which is available on the OIG
website at www.hhs.gov/oig/frdalrt/index.htm.  The following is a summary of the Special Fraud
Alert.
<p>The term "gainsharing" typically refers to an arrangement in which a hospital gives a physician a
percentage share of any reduction in the hospital's costs for patient care attributable in part to the
physician's efforts.  The civil monetary penalty (CMP) that applies to gainsharing arrangements
is set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(b)(1).  This section prohibits any hospital or critical access
hospital from knowingly making a payment directly or indirectly to a physician as an
inducement to reduce or limit services to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries under a physician's
care.
<p>It is the OIG's position that the CMP law clearly prohibits any gainsharing arrangements that
involve payments by or on behalf of a hospital to physicians with clinical care responsibilities,
directly or indirectly, to induce a reduction or limitation of services to Medicare or Medicaid
patients.  However, hospitals and physicians are not prohibited from working together to reduce
unnecessary hospital costs through other arrangements.  For example, hospitals and physicians
may enter into personal services contracts where hospitals pay physicians based on a fixed fee at
fair market value for services rendered to reduce costs rather than a fee based on a share of cost
savings.<p><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Physician Billing Practices</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Third-Party Billing Services</b></i>

<p>Physicians should remember that they remain responsible to the Medicare program for bills sent
in the physician's name or containing the physician's signature, even if the physician had no
actual knowledge of a billing impropriety.  The attestation on the HCFA 1500 form,
i.e., the
physician's signature line, states that the physician's services were billed properly.  In other
words, it is no defense for the physician if the physician's billing service improperly bills
Medicare.
<p>One of the most common risk areas involving billing services deals with physician practices
contracting with billing services on a percentage basis.  Although percentage based billing
arrangements are not illegal per se, the Office of Inspector General has a longstanding concern
that such arrangements may increase the risk of intentional upcoding and similar abusive billing
practices.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>

<br><br>
A physician may contract with a billing service on a percentage basis.  However, the billing
service cannot directly receive Medicare payments made to the physician.   Under 42 U.S.C.
1395u(b)(6), Medicare payments can only be made to either the beneficiary or a party (such as a
physician) that furnished the services and accepted assignment of the beneficiary's claim.  A
billing service that contracts on a percentage basis does not qualify as a party that furnished
services to a beneficiary, thus a billing service cannot directly receive Medicare payments. 
According to the Medicare Carriers Manual 3060(A), a payment is considered to be made
directly to the billing service if the service can convert the payment to its own use and control
without the payment first passing through the control of the physician.  For example, the billing
service cannot bill the claims under its own name or tax identification number.  The billing
service must bill claims under the physician's name and tax identification number.  Nor can a
billing service have the Medicare payments sent directly to its office or its bank account.  The
Medicare payments should instead be sent to the physician's office or bank account.
<p>Physician practices should review the third-party medical billing guidance for additional
information on third-party billing companies and the compliance risk areas associated with
billing companies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Billing Practices by Non-Participating Physicians</i></b>

<p>Even though nonparticipating physicians do not accept payment directly from the Medicare
program, there are a number of laws that apply to the billing of Medicare beneficiaries by non-participating physicians.
<p><u>Limiting Charges</u>
<p>42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(g) prohibits a nonparticipating physician from knowingly and willfully
billing or collecting on a repeated basis an actual charge for a service that is in excess of the
Medicare limiting charge.  For example, a nonparticipating physician may not bill a Medicare
beneficiary $50 for an office visit when the Medicare limiting charge for the visit is $25. 
Additionally, there are numerous provisions that prohibit nonparticipating physicians from
knowingly and willfully charging patients in excess of the statutory charge limitations for certain
specified procedures, such as cataract surgery, mammography screening, and coronary artery
bypass surgery.  Physicians who fail to comply with these sections may be fined up to $10,000
per violation or be excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for up to five
years.
<p><u>Refund of Excess Charges</u>
<p>42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(g) mandates that if a nonparticipating physician collects an actual charge for
a service that is in excess of the limiting charge, the physician must refund the amount collected
above the limiting charge to the individual within 30 days notice of the violation.  For example,
if a physician collected $50 from a Medicare beneficiary for an office visit, but the limiting
charge for the visit was $25, the physician must refund $25 to the beneficiary, which is the
difference between the amount collected ($50) and the limiting charge ($25).  Physicians who
fail to comply may be fined up to $10,000 per violation or be excluded from participation in
Federal health care programs for up to 5 years.

<br><br>
42 U.S.C. 1395u(l)(A)(iii) mandates that a nonparticipating physician must refund payments
received from a Medicare beneficiary if it is later determined by a Peer Review Organization or
a Medicare carrier that the services were not reasonable and necessary.  Physicians who fail to
refund the payments may be fined up to $10,000 per violation or be excluded from participation
in Federal health care programs for up to 5 years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Professional Courtesy</i></b>
<p>The term "professional courtesy" is used to describe a number of analytically different practices. 
The traditional definition is the practice by a physician of waiving all, or a part, of the fee for
services provided to the physician's office staff, other physicians, and/or their families.  In recent
times, "professional courtesy" has come to also mean the waiver of coinsurance obligations or
other out-of-pocket expenses for physicians or their families (i.e., "insurance only" billing), and
similar payment arrangements by hospitals or other institutions for services provided to their
medical staffs or employees.  While only the first of these practices is truly "professional
courtesy," in the interests of clarity and completeness, we will address all three.<br>

<br>In general, whether a professional courtesy arrangement runs afoul of the fraud and abuse laws is
determined by two factors:  (i) how the recipients of the professional courtesy are selected; and
(ii) how the professional courtesy is extended.  If recipients are selected in a manner that directly
or indirectly takes into account their ability to affect past or future referrals, the anti-kickback
statute -- which prohibits giving anything of value to generate Federal health care program
business -- may be implicated.  If the professional courtesy is extended through a waiver of
copayment obligations (i.e., "insurance only" billing), other statutes may be implicated,
including the prohibition of inducements to beneficiaries, section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act
(codified at 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5)).  Claims submitted as a result of either practice may also
implicate the civil False Claims Act.
<p>The following are general observations about professional courtesy arrangements that physician
practices should consider:
<ul>
  <li>	a physician's regular and consistent practice of extending professional courtesy
by waiving the entire fee for services rendered to a group of persons (including
employees, physicians, and/or their family members) may not implicate any of
the OIG's fraud and abuse authorities so long as membership in the group
receiving the courtesy is determined in a manner that does not take into account
directly or indirectly any group member's ability to refer to, or otherwise generate
Federal health care program business for, the physician.<br>
	</li>
  <li>a non-referring physician's regular and consistent practice of extending
professional courtesy by waiving otherwise applicable copayments for services
rendered to physicians, referring and non-referring alike, their employees and
family members, would not implicate the anti-kickback statute so long as
membership in the group is determined in a manner that does not take into
account directly or indirectly any group member's ability to refer to, or otherwise
generate Federal health care program business for, the physician.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>any waiver of copayment practice, including that described in the preceding
bullet, does implicate section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act if the patient for whom the
copayment is waived is a Federal health care program beneficiary who is not
financially needy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The legality of particular professional courtesy arrangements will turn on the specific facts
presented, and, with respect to the anti-kickback statute, on the specific intent of the parties. 
Physicians who are concerned that their particular practices may run afoul of the Federal fraud
and abuse laws may request an OIG advisory opinion pursuant to regulations at 42 CFR Part
1008 (See Appendix D for further detail), except for matters pertaining to the physician self-referral law, which are addressed by
HCFA.
<p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Other Risk Areas</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rental of Space in Physician Offices by Persons or Entities to Which
Physicians Refer</i></b>

<p>In February 2000, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on this topic, which is available on the
OIG website at www.hhs.gov/oig/frdalrt/index.htm.  The following is a summary of the Special
Fraud Alert.
<p>Among various relationships between physicians and labs, hospitals, home health agencies, etc.,
the OIG has identified potentially illegal practices involving the rental of space in a physician's
office by suppliers that provide items or services to patients who are referred or sent to the
supplier by the physician-landlord.  An example of a suspect arrangement is the rental of
physician office space by a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier in a position to benefit
from referrals of the physician's patients.  The OIG is concerned that in such arrangements the
rental payments may be disguised kickbacks to the physician-landlord to induce referrals.
<p><u>Space Rental Safe Harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute</u>
<p>To avoid potentially violating the anti-kickback Statute, the OIG recommends that rental
agreements should comply with all of the following criteria for the space rental safe harbor:
<ul>
  <li>The agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties.</li>
  <li>The agreement covers all of the space rented by the parties for the term of the agreement
and specifies the space covered by the agreement.</li>
  <li>If the agreement is intended to provide the lessee with access to the space for periodic
intervals of time rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the rental agreement, the
rental agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, the precise length of
each interval, and the exact rent for each interval.</li>
  <li>The term of the rental agreement is for not less than one year.</li>
  <li>The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value, and is
not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or
business otherwise generated between the parties for which payment may be made in
whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program.</li>
  <li>The aggregate space rented does not exceed that which is reasonably necessary to
accomplish the commercially reasonable business purpose of the rental.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unlawful Advertising</b></i>
<p>42 U.S.C. 1320b-10 makes it unlawful for any person to advertise using the names,
abbreviations, symbols, or emblems of the Social Security Administration, Health Care
Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Medicare, Medicaid or
any combination or variation of such words, abbreviations, symbols or emblems in a manner that
such person knows or should know would convey the false impression that the advertised item is
endorsed by the named entities.  For instance, a physician may not place an ad in the newspaper
that reads "Dr. X is a cardiologist approved by both the Medicare and Medicaid programs."  A
violation of this section may result in a penalty of up to $5,000 ($25,000 in the case of a
broadcast or telecast) for each violation.
<p align="center"><b>APPENDIX B:   CRIMINAL STATUTES</b>
<p>This Appendix contains a description of criminal statutes related to fraud and abuse in the
context of health care.  The Appendix is not intended to be a compilation of all Federal statutes
related to health care fraud and abuse.  It is merely a summary of some of the more frequently
cited Federal statutes.
<p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Health Care Fraud (18 U.S.C. 1347)</u></b>

<p><i><b>Description of Unlawful Conduct</b></i>
<p>It is a crime to knowingly and willfully execute (or attempt to execute) a scheme to defraud any
health care benefit program, or to obtain money or property from a health care benefit program
through false representations.  Note that this law applies not only to Federal health care
programs, but to most other types of health care benefit programs as well.
<p><i><b>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</b></i>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of fines, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both.  If the
violation results in serious bodily injury, the prison term may be increased to a maximum of 20
years.  If the violation results in death, the prison term may be expanded to include any number
of years, or life imprisonment.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Dr. X, a chiropractor, intentionally billed Medicare for physical therapy and chiropractic
treatments that he knew were never rendered.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. X, a psychiatrist, billed Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS, and private insurers for
psychiatric services that were provided by his nurses rather than himself. </li>

</ol>

<p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; <b><u>Theft or Embezzlement in Connection with Health Care (18
U.S.C. 669)</u></b>
<p><i><b>Description of Unlawful Conduct<br>

<br></b></i>It is a crime to knowingly and willfully embezzle, steal or intentionally misapply any of the
assets of a health care benefit program.  Note that this law applies not only to Federal health care
programs, but to most other types of health care benefit programs as well.
<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of a fine, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both.  If the
value of the asset is $100 or less, the penalty is a fine, imprisonment of up to a year, or both.
<p><b><i>Example</i></b>
<p>An office manager for Dr. X knowingly embezzles money from the bank account for Dr. X's
practice.  The bank account includes reimbursement received from the Medicare program; thus,
intentional embezzlement of funds from this account is a violation of the law.
<p><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters (18 U.S.C. 1035)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>It is a crime to knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact, or make any materially
false statement or use any materially false writing or document in connection with the delivery
of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.  Note that this law applies not only to
Federal health care programs, but to most other types of health care benefit programs as well.
<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of a fine, imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both.
<p><b><i>Example</i></b>
<p>Dr. X certified on a claim form that he performed laser surgery on a Medicare beneficiary when
he knew that the surgery was not actually performed on the patient.
<p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Obstruction of Criminal Investigations of Health Care Offenses (18 U.S.C. 1518)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>It is a crime to willfully prevent, obstruct, mislead, delay or attempt to prevent, obstruct,
mislead, or delay the communication of records relating to a Federal health care offense to a
criminal investigator.  Note that this law applies not only to Federal health care programs, but to
most other types of health care benefit programs as well.
<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of a fine, imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Dr. X instructs his employees to tell OIG investigators that Dr. X personally performs all
treatments when, in fact, medical technicians do the majority of the treatment and Dr. X
is rarely present in the office.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. X was under investigation by the FBI for reported fraudulent billings.  Dr. X altered
patient records in an attempt to cover up the improprieties. </li>
</ol>

<p><b>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mail and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. 1341, 1343)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>It is a crime to use the mail, private courier, or wire service to conduct a scheme to defraud
another of money or property.  The term "wire services" includes the use of a telephone, fax
machine or computer.  Each use of a mail or wire service to further fraudulent activities is
considered a separate crime.  For instance, each fraudulent claim that is submitted electronically
to a carrier would be considered a separate violation of the law.
<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of a fine, imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<p>1. 	Dr. X electronically submits claims to the Medicare fiscal intermediary via his computer
for office visits that he did not actually provide to Medicare beneficiaries.
<p>2. 	Dr. X, a neurologist, knowingly submitted claims for tests that were not reasonable and
necessary and intentionally upcoded office visits and Electromyograms to Medicare.
<p><b>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Criminal Penalties for Acts Involving Federal Health Care Programs
(42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p><u>False Statements and Representations</u>
<p>It is a crime to knowingly and willfully:
<ul>
  <li>make, or cause to be made, false statements or representations in applying for benefits or
payments under all Federal health care programs;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>make, or cause to be made, any false statement or representation for use in determining
rights to such benefit or payment;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>conceal any event affecting an individual's initial or continued right to receive a benefit
or payment with the intent to fraudulently receive the benefit or payment either in an
amount or quantity greater than that which is due or authorized;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>convert a benefit or payment to a use other than for the use and benefit of the person for
whom it was intended;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>present, or cause to be presented, a claim for a physician's service when the service was
not furnished by a licensed physician;<br>
  </li>

  <li>for a fee, counsel an individual to dispose of assets in order to become eligible for
medical assistance under a State health program, if disposing of the assets results in the
imposition of an ineligibility period for the individual.</li>

</ul>

<p><u>Anti-Kickback Statute</u>
<p>It is a crime to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay remuneration of any kind 
(e.g., money, goods, services):
<ul>
  <li>for the referral of an individual to another for the purpose of supplying items or services
that are covered by a Federal health care program; or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any good, facility, service, or item that
is covered by a Federal health care program.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are a number of limited exceptions to the law, also known as "safe harbors," which
provide immunity from criminal prosecution and which are described in greater detail in the
statute and related regulations (found at 42 CFR 1001.952 and at
www.hhs.gov/oig/ak/index.htm#OIG Safe Harbor Regulations).  Current safe harbors include:
<ul>
  <li>investment interests; </li>
  <li>space rental; </li>
  <li>equipment rental; </li>
  <li>personal services and management contracts; </li>
  <li>sale of practice; </li>
  <li>referral services; </li>
  <li>warranties; </li>
  <li>discounts; </li>
  <li>employment relationships; </li>
  <li>waiver of Part A co-insurance and deductible amounts; </li>
  <li>group purchasing organizations; </li>
  <li>increased coverage or reduced cost sharing under a risk-basis or prepaid plan; and </li>
  <li>charge reduction agreements with health plans.</li>

</ul>

<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty may include the imposition of a fine of up to $25,000, imprisonment of up to 5
years, or both.  In addition, the provider can be excluded from participation in Federal health
care programs.  The regulations defining the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that must
be reviewed by the OIG in making an exclusion determination are set forth in 42 CFR Part 1001.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Dr. X accepted payments to sign Certificates of Medical Necessity for durable medical
equipment for patients she never examined.<br>
 </li>
  <li>Home Health Agency disguises referral fees as salaries by paying referring physician Dr.
X for services Dr. X never rendered to Medicare beneficiaries or by paying Dr. X. a sum
in excess of fair market value for the services he rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.</li>

</ol>

<p align="center"><b>APPENDIX C: CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STATUTES</b>
<p>This Appendix contains a description of civil and administrative statutes related to fraud and
abuse in the context of health care.  The Appendix is not intended to be a compilation of all
Federal statutes related to health care fraud and abuse.  It is merely a summary of some of the
more frequently cited Federal statutes.
<p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C.  3729-3733)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>This is the law most often used to bring a case against a health care provider for the submission
of false claims to a Federal health care program.  The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly
presenting (or causing to be presented) to the Federal Government a false or fraudulent claim for
payment or approval.  Additionally, it prohibits knowingly making or using (or causing to be
made or used) a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by
the Federal Government or it agents, like a carrier, other claims processor, or state Medicaid
program.
<p><b>Definitions</b>
<p><u>False Claim </u> - A false claim is a claim for payment for services or supplies that were not
provided specifically as presented or for which the provider is otherwise not entitled to payment. 
Examples of false claims for services or supplies that were not provided specifically as presented
include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>a claim for a service or supply that was never provided.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a claim indicating the service was provided for some diagnosis code other than the true
diagnosis code in order to obtain reimbursement for the service (which would not be
covered if the true diagnosis code were submitted).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a claim indicating a higher level of service than was actually provided. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a claim for a service that the provider knows is not reasonable and necessary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a claim for services provided by an unlicensed individual.</li>

</ul>

<p><u>Knowingly</u> - To "knowingly" present a false or fraudulent claim means that the provider:  1) has
actual knowledge that the information on the claim is false; 2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the
truth or falsity of the information on the claim; or 3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or
falsity of the information on the claim.  It is important to note the provider does not have to
deliberately intend to defraud the Federal Government in order to be found liable under this Act. 
The provider need only "knowingly" present a false or fraudulent claim in the manner described
above.

<p><u>Deliberate Ignorance</u> - To act in "deliberate ignorance" means that the provider has deliberately
chosen to ignore the truth or falsity of the information on a claim submitted for payment, even
though the provider knows, or has notice, that information may be false.  An example of a
provider who submits a false claim with deliberate ignorance would be a physician who ignores
provider update bulletins and thus does not inform his/her staff of changes in the Medicare
billing guidelines or update his/her billing system in accordance with changes to Medicare
billing practices.  When claims for non-reimbursable services are submitted as a result, the False
Claims Act has been violated.
<p><u>Reckless Disregard </u> - To act in "reckless disregard" means that the provider pays no regard to
whether the information on a claim submitted for payment is true or false.  An example of a
provider who submits a false claim with reckless disregard would be a physician who assigns the
billing function to an untrained office person without inquiring whether the employee has the
requisite knowledge and training to accurately file such claims.
<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The penalty for violating the False Claims Act is a minimum of $5,000 up to a maximum of
$10,000 for each false claim submitted.  In addition to the penalty, a provider could be found
liable for up to three times the amount unlawfully claimed.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ul>
  <li>A physician and his oncology clinic knowingly submitted improper claims to Medicare
and Medicaid for services rendered at the clinic by nonphysicians without a physician's
supervision or attendance. </li>

  <li>Dr. X intentionally upcoded office visits and angioplasty consultations that were
submitted for payment to Medicare.   </li>

  <li>Dr. X, a podiatrist, knowingly submitted claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programs
for non-routine surgical procedures when he actually performed routine, non-covered
services such as the cutting and trimming of toenails and the removal of corns and
calluses. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL) is a comprehensive statute that covers an array of
fraudulent and abusive activities and is very similar to the False Claims Act.  For instance, the
CMPL prohibits a health care provider from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for
services that the provider "knows or should know" were:
<ul>
  <li>not provided as indicated by the coding on the claim;</li>
  <li>not reasonable or necessary;</li>
  <li>furnished by a person who is not licensed as a physician (or who was not properly
supervised by a licensed physician);</li>
  <li>furnished by a licensed physician who obtained his or her license through
misrepresentation of a material fact (such as cheating on a licensing exam);</li>
  <li>furnished by a physician who was not certified in the medical specialty that he or she
claimed to be certified in; or</li>
  <li>furnished by a physician who was excluded from participation in the Federal health care
program to which the claim was submitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the CMPL contains various other prohibitions, including:
<ul>
  <li>offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or
should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to obtain items or services billed to
Medicare or Medicaid from a particular provider; and</li>
  <li>employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the person knows or should
know is excluded from participation in a Federal health care program.</li>
</ul>

<p>The term "should know" means that a provider:  1) acted in deliberate ignorance of the truth or
falsity of the information; or 2) acted in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the
information.  The Federal Government does not have to show that a provider specifically
intended to defraud a Federal health care program in order to prove a provider violated the
statute.

<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>Violation of the CMPL may result in a penalty of up to $10,000 per item or service and up to
three times the amount unlawfully claimed.  In addition, the provider may be excluded from
participation in Federal health care programs.  The regulations defining the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances that must be reviewed by the OIG in making an exclusion
determination are set forth in 42 CFR Part 1003.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Dr. X paid Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries $20 each time they visited him to
receive services and have tests performed that were not preventive care services and
tests.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. X hired Physician Assistant P to provide services to Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries without conducting a background check on P.  Had Dr. X performed a
background check by reviewing the HHS-OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities, Dr.
X. would have discovered that he should not hire P because P is excluded for a period of
5 years from participation in Federal health care programs.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. X and his oximetry company billed Medicare for pulse oximetry that they knew they
did not perform and services that had been intentionally upcoded.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Limitations on Certain Physician Referrals ("Stark Laws") (42 U.S.C. 1395nn)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Description of Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>Physicians (and immediate family members) who have an ownership, investment or
compensation relationship with an entity providing "designated health services" are prohibited
from referring patients for these services where payment may be made by a Federal health care
program unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies.  An entity providing a designated
health service is prohibited from billing for the provision of a service that was provided based on
a prohibited referral. Designated health services include:  clinical laboratory services; physical
therapy services; occupational therapy services; radiology services, including magnetic
resonance imaging, axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services; radiation therapy services
and supplies; durable medical equipment and supplies; parenteral and enteral nutrients,
equipment and supplies; prosthetics, orthotics, prosthetic devices and supplies; home health
services; outpatient prescription drugs; and inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
<p>New regulations clarifying the exceptions to the Stark Laws are expected to be issued by HCFA
during the summer of 2000.  Current exceptions articulated within the Stark Laws include the
following, provided all conditions of each exception as set forth in the statute and regulations are
satisfied.
<p><u>Exceptions for Ownership or Compensation Arrangements</u>
<ol>
  <li>physician's services;</li>
  <li>in-office ancillary services; and&nbsp;</li>
  <li>prepaid plans</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Exceptions for Ownership or Investment in Publicly Traded Securities and Mutual Funds</u>
<ol>
  <li>ownership of investment securities which may be purchased on terms generally available
to the public;</li>
  <li>ownership of shares in a regulated investment company as defined by Federal law, if
such company had, at the end of the company's most recent fiscal year, or on average,
during the previous 3 fiscal years, total assets exceeding $75,000,000;</li>
  <li>hospital in Puerto Rico;</li>
  <li>rural provider; and</li>
  <li>hospital ownership (whole hospital exception).</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Exceptions Relating to Other Compensation Arrangements</u>
<ol>
  <li>rental of office space and rental of equipment;</li>
  <li>bona fide employment relationship;</li>
  <li>personal service arrangement;</li>
  <li>remuneration unrelated to the provision of designated health services;</li>
  <li>physician recruitment;</li>
  <li>isolated transactions;</li>
  <li>certain group practice arrangements with a hospital (pre-1989); and</li>
  <li>payments by a physician for items and services</li>
</ol>

<p><b><i>Penalty for Unlawful Conduct</i></b>
<p>Violations of the statute subject the billing entity to denial of payment for the designated health
services, refund of amounts collected from improperly submitted claims, and a civil monetary
penalty of up to $15,000 for each improper claim submitted.  Physicians who violate the statute
may also be subject to additional fines per prohibited referral.  In addition, providers that enter
into an arrangement that they know or should know circumvents the referral restriction law may
be subject to a CMP of up to $100,000 per arrangement.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Dr. A worked in a medical clinic located in a major city.  She also owned a free standing
laboratory located in a major city.  Dr. A referred all orders for laboratory tests on her
patients to the laboratory she owned.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. X agreed to serve as the Medical Director of Home Health Agency, HHA for which
he was paid a sum substantially above the fair market value for his services.  In return,
Dr. X routinely referred his Medicare and Medicaid patients to HHA for home health
services.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Dr. Y received a monthly stipend of $500 from a local hospital to assist him in meeting
practice expenses.  Dr. Y performed no specific service for the stipend and had no
obligation to repay the hospital.  Dr. Y referred patients to the hospital for in-patient
surgery.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Exclusion of Certain Individuals and Entities From Participation in
Medicare and</u><u> other Federal Health Care Programs (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7)</u></b>
<p><b><i>Mandatory Exclusion</i></b>
<p>Individuals or entities convicted of the following conduct must be excluded from participation in
Medicare and Medicaid for a minimum of 5 years:
<ul>
  <li>a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare or
Medicaid;</li>
  <li>a conviction under Federal or State law of a criminal offense relating to the neglect or
abuse of a patient;</li>
  <li>a conviction under Federal or State law of a felony relating to fraud, theft, embezzlement,
breach of fiduciary responsibility or other financial misconduct against a health care
program financed by any Federal, State, or local government agency; or</li>
  <li>a conviction under Federal or State law of a felony relating to unlawful manufacture,
distribution, prescription, or dispensing of a controlled substance.</li>

</ul>

<p>If there is one prior conviction, the exclusion will be for 10 years.  If there are two prior
convictions, the exclusion will be permanent.
<p><i><b>Permissive Exclusion</b></i>
<p>Individuals or entities may be excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for a
minimum of 3 years if they meet any of the following criteria:
<ul>
  <li>a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare or
Medicaid;</li>
  <li>a misdemeanor related to fraud, theft, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary responsibility
or other financial misconduct against a health care program financed by any Federal,
State, or local government agency;</li>
  <li>interference with, or obstruction of, any investigation into certain criminal offenses;</li>
  <li>a misdemeanor related to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescription or
dispensing of a controlled substance;</li>
  <li>exclusion or suspension under a Federal or State health care program;</li>
  <li>submission of claims for excessive charges, unnecessary services or services that were of
a quality which fails to meet professionally recognized standards of health care;</li>
  <li>violating the CMP law or the statute entitled "Criminal Penalties for Acts Involving
Federal Health Care Programs";</li>
  <li>ownership or control of an entity by a sanctioned individual or immediate family member
(spouse, natural or adoptive parent, child, sibling, stepparent, stepchild, stepbrother or
stepsister, in-laws, grandparent and grandchild);</li>
  <li>failure to disclose information required by law;</li>
  <li>failure to supply claims payment information; and</li>
  <li>defaulting on health education loan or scholarship obligations.</li>

</ul>

<p>The above list is not all inclusive.  Additional grounds for permissive exclusion are detailed in
the statute.
<p><b><i>Examples</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>Nurse R was excluded based on a conviction involving obtaining dangerous drugs by
forgery.  She also altered prescriptions that were given for her own health problems
before she presented them to the pharmacist to be filled.</li>

  &nbsp;  <li>Practice T was excluded due to its affiliation with its excluded owner.  The practice
owner, excluded from participation in the Federal health care programs for soliciting and
receiving illegal kickbacks, was still participating in the day-to-day operations of the
practice after his exclusion was effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>II.  Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol</u></b>
<p>The recommended method for a provider to contact the OIG regarding potential fraud or abuse
issues that may exist in the provider's own organization is through the use of the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol.  This program encourages providers to voluntarily disclose irregularities in
their dealings with Federal health care programs.  While voluntary disclosure under the protocol
does not guarantee a provider protection from civil, criminal or administrative actions, the fact
that a provider voluntarily disclosed possible wrongdoing is a mitigating factor in OIG's
recommendations to prosecuting agencies.  Self-reporting offers providers the opportunity to
minimize the potential cost and disruption of a full-scale audit and investigation, to negotiate a
fair monetary settlement, and to avoid an OIG permissive exclusion preventing the provider
from doing business with Federal health care programs.  In addition, if the provider is obligated
to enter into an Integrity Agreement (IA) as part of the resolution of a voluntary disclosure, there
are three benefits the provider might receive as a result of self-reporting:
<ol>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>If the provider has an effective compliance program and agrees to maintain its
compliance program as part of the False Claims Act settlement, the OIG may not
even require an IA;<br>
 </li>

    <li>In cases where the provider's own audits detected the disclosed problem, the OIG
may consider alternatives to the IA's auditing provisions.  The provider may be
able to perform some or all of its billing audits through internal auditing methods
rather than be required to retain an independent review organization to perform
the billing review; and<br>
    </li>

    <li>Self-disclosing can help to demonstrate a provider's trustworthiness to the OIG
and may result in the OIG determining that they can sufficiently safeguard the
Federal health care programs through an IA without the exclusion remedy for a
material breach, which is typically included in an IA.</li>

  </ul>
</ol>

<p>Specific instructions on how to submit a voluntary disclosure under the Provider Self-Disclosure
Protocol can be found on the OIG's internet site at www.hhs.gov/oig or in the Federal Register at
63 FR 58399.
<p>The Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol can also be a useful tool for conducting baseline audits. 
The protocol details the OIG's views on the appropriate elements of an effective investigative
and audit plan for providers.  Physician practices can use the self-disclosure protocol as a model
for conducting audits and self-assessments.
<p>In relying on the protocol for audit design and sample selection, a physician practice should pay
close attention to the sections on self-assessment and sample selection.  These two sections
provide valuable guidance regarding how these two functions should be performed.
<p>The self-assessment section of the protocol contains information that can be applied to audit
design.  Self-assessment is an internal financial assessment to determine the monetary impact of
the matter.  The approach of a review can include reviewing either all claims affected or a
statistically valid sample of the claims.
<p>Sample selection must include several elements.  These elements are drawn from the
Government sampling program known as RAT-STATS.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> All of these elements are set forth in
more detail in the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol, but the elements include:  (1) sampling
unit, (2) sampling frame, (3) probe sample, (4) sample size, (5) random numbers, (6) sample
design and (7) missing sample items.  All of these sampling elements should be clearly
documented by the physician practice and compiled in the format set forth in the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol.  Use of the format set forth in the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol will
help physician practices to ensure that the elements of their internal audits are in conformance
with OIG standards.<br>

<p align="center">	<u><b>	III.  Advisory Opinion Requests</b></u>
<p>Health care professionals or others may request an advisory opinion from OIG on the following
issues:
<ul>
  <li>what constitutes prohibited "remuneration" or payment under the anti-kickback statute;</li>
  <li>whether the arrangement or proposed arrangement fits into a safe harbor to the anti-kickback statute;</li>
  <li>what constitutes an inducement to reduce or limit services to Medicare/Medicaid
beneficiaries; and</li>
  <li>whether any activity or proposed activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of fraud
and abuse sanctions. </li>

</ul>

<p>The OIG issues Advisory Opinions on specific existing or proposed arrangements in which the
requesting party is engaged or in good faith intends to engage; the OIG does not issue Advisory
Opinions on hypothetical arrangements.  Advisory Opinions will not be issued on questions of
fair market value or whether an individual is a bona fide employee.  Advisory Opinions will be
binding only on the requesting party and the OIG.  Failure to seek an Advisory Opinion is not
admissible as evidence of intent to violate the law.

<br><br>
Procedures for requesting an Advisory Opinion are available on the OIG website at
www.hhs.gov/oig or at 42 CFR 1008.1 through 1008.59.

<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>Much of this guidance can also apply to other independent practitioners, such as
psychologists, physical therapists, speech language pathologists, and occupational therapists.
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>Currently, the OIG has issued compliance program guidance for the following eight
industry sectors:  hospitals, clinical laboratories, home health agencies, durable medical
equipment suppliers, third-party medical billing companies, hospices, Medicare+Choice
organizations offering coordinated care plans, and nursing facilities.  All of the guidance is
available on the OIG website at http://www.oig.hhs.gov in the Electronic Reading Room or by
calling the OIG Public Affairs office at (202) 619-1343.
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>The OIG periodically issues Advisory Opinions responding 
  to specific inquiries concerning the application of the OIG's authorities, in 
  particular, the anti-kickback statute, and Special Fraud Alerts setting forth 
  activities that raise legal and enforcement issues. These documents, as well 
  as reports from the OIG's Office of Audit Services (OAS) and Office of Evaluation 
  and Inspections (OEI) can be obtained on the Internet at: http://www.oig.hhs.gov. 
  We also recommend that physician practices regularly review the Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) website on the Internet at http://www.hcfa.gov, 
  for up-to-date regulations, manuals, and program memoranda related to the Medicare 
  and Medicaid programs. 
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an
effective compliance program
that pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the appropriateness of
administrative sanctions.  However, the burden is on the physician practice to demonstrate the
operational effectiveness of the compliance program. See 62 FR 67392.  In addition, criminal
sanctions may be mitigated by an effective compliance program that was in place at the time of
the criminal offense. See United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, Guidelines Manual,
8 A1.2, Application Note 3(d).

the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe the appropriate sanctions for offenders
convicted of Federal crimes.
<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>Available on the OIG website at http://www.oig.hhs.gov.
<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>Practices with laboratories or arrangements with third-party billing companies should
check the risk areas included in the guidance for those industries.  The guidance is available on
the OIG website at http://www.oig.hhs.gov.
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>There are many published summaries of reimbursement requirements of varying
specificity and quality.  Various specialty and trade associations may also have developed such
summaries.
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>The OIG recommends that, in addition to the list set forth below, physicians review the
OIG's Work Plan to identify vulnerabilities and risk areas on which the OIG will focus in the
future.  In addition, it is recommended that physician practices review the OIG's semiannual
reports, which identify program vulnerabilities and risk areas that the OIG has targeted during
the preceding six months.  All of these documents are available on the OIG's webpage at
http://www.oig.hhs.gov.
<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>A listing of additional risk areas that a physician practice may want to include in its
policies can be found at Appendix A of this document.
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>For example, Dr. X, an ophthalmologist, bills for laser surgery he did not perform.  As
proof, he did not even have laser equipment or access to such equipment at the place of service
designated on the claim form to perform the surgery.
<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>Billing for services which are not reasonable and necessary, supplies and equipment
involves seeking reimbursement for a service that is not warranted by a patient's documented
medical condition. See 42 U.S.C. 1395i(a)(1)(A)  ("no payment may be made under part A or
part B [of Medicare] for any expenses incurred for items or services which . . . are not reasonable
and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of
the malformed body member"). See also Appendix A for further discussion on this topic.
<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>Double billing occurs when the physician bills for the same item or service more than
once or when another party bills the Federal health care program for an item or service also
billed by the physician.  Although duplicate billing can occur due to simple error, the knowing
submission of duplicate claims -- which is sometimes evidenced by systematic or repeated
double billing -- can create liability under criminal, civil, and/or administrative law. 
<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>Of particular concern, physician practices should be aware of the provisions of
reassignment of benefits.  These provisions govern who may receive payment due to a provider
or supplier of services or a beneficiary. See 42 CFR 424.70-424.80. See also Medicare Carrier
Manual &#167; 3060.10. 
<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a>Unbundling is the practice of a physician billing for multiple components of a service
that must be included in a single fee.  For example, if dressings and instruments are included in a
fee for a minor procedure, the provider may not also bill separately for the dressings and
instruments.
<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>A modifier, as defined by the CPT-4 manual, provides the means by which the
physician practice can indicate a service or procedure that has been performed has been altered
by some specific circumstance, but not changed in its definition or code.  Assuming the modifier
is used correctly and appropriately, this specificity provides the justification for payment for
those services.  For correct use of modifiers, the physician practice should reference the
appropriate sections of the Medicare Carrier Manual. See Medicare Carrier Manual &#167; 4630.  For
general information on the correct use of modifiers, the physician practice should also consult
the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) system. See Appendix F for information on how
to access the NCCI system.  The NCCI coding edits are updated on a quarterly basis and are
used to process claims and determine payments to physicians.
<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>Upcoding is billing for a more expensive service than the one actually performed.  For
example, Dr. X defrauds Medicare by intentionally billing at a higher evaluation and
management (E and M) code than what he actually renders to the patient.  Upcoding has been a
major focus of the OIG's law enforcement efforts.  In fact, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 added another civil monetary penalty to the OIG's sanction
authorities for upcoding violations. See 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(1)(A).
<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>The official coding guidelines are promulgated by HCFA, the National Center for
Health Statistics, the American Medical Association and the American Health Information
Management Association. See International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9 CM)(and its successors); 1998 Health Care Financing Administration
Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) (and its successors); and Physicians' Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT).  In addition, there are specialized coding systems for specific
segments of the health care industry.  Among these are ADA (for dental procedures), DSM IV
(psychiatric health benefits) and DMERCs (for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics
and supplies).
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>The failure of a physician practice to:  (i) document items and services rendered; and
(ii) properly submit them for reimbursement is a major area of potential fraudulent or erroneous
conduct involving Federal health care programs.  The OIG has undertaken numerous audits,
investigations, inspections and national enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing potential and
actual fraud, abuse and waste in these areas. 
<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a>See 42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(1)(A).
<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a>For additional information on proper documentation, physician practices should also
reference the Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management (E&amp;M) Services,
published by HCFA. These guidelines are available on the Internet at
http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mcarpti.htm. 
<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>The anti-kickback statute provides criminal penalties for individuals and entities that
knowingly offer, pay, solicit, or receive bribes or kickbacks or other remuneration in order to
induce business reimbursable by Federal health care programs. See 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b). 
Civil penalties, exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs, and civil False
Claims Act liability may also result from a violation of the prohibition. See 42 U.S.C. 

<p>1320a-7a(a)(5), 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7), and 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733.
<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>The physician self-referral law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, (also known as the "Stark law"),
prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity with which the physician or any
member of the physician's immediate family has a financial relationship if the referral is for the
furnishing of designated health services, unless the financial relationship fits into an exception
set forth in the statute or implementing regulations. 
<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>See Appendix B for additional information on the anti-kickback statute.
<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>The OIG's definition of "fair market value" is not the typical commercial definition of
this term.  The OIG's definition of this term excludes any value attributable to referrals of
Federal program business on the ability to influence the flow of such business.  Adhering to the
rule of keeping business arrangements at fair market value is not a guarantee of legality, but is a
highly useful general rule.
<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>See 42 U.S.C. 1128A(a)(5).
<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>In the OIG Special Fraud Alert "Routine Waiver of Part B Co-payments/ Deductibles"
(May 1991), the OIG describes several reasons why routine waivers of these cost-sharing
amounts pose concerns.  The Alert sets forth the circumstances under which it may be
appropriate to waive these amounts. See also 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5).
<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>All physician contracts and agreements with parties in a position to influence Federal
health care program business or to whom the doctor is in such a position to influence should be
reviewed to avoid violation of the anti-kickback, self-referral, and other relevant Federal and
State laws.  The OIG has published safe harbors that define practices not subject to the anti-kickback statute, because such arrangements would be unlikely to result in fraud or abuse. 
Failure to comply with a safe harbor provision does not make an arrangement per se illegal. 
Rather, the safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, if fully met, would assure the entities
involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the arrangement qualifying for the safe
harbor.  One such safe harbor applies to personal services contracts. See 42 CFR 1001.952(d).  
<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a>See OIG Special Fraud Alert "Joint Venture Arrangements" (August 1989) available on
the OIG website at http://www.oig.hhs.gov. See also OIG Advisory Opinion 97-5.
<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>Physician practices should establish clear policies governing gift-giving because such
exchanges may be viewed as inducements to influence business decisions.  Practice policies
should emphasize that accepting gifts of any kind may influence the employee's independent
judgment.  To the extent such gifts are accepted, they should be reported to the designated
person charged with recording such information for the practice.
<p><a name="N_35_">35. </a>Practices should also check the HCFA website for the most recent regulations regarding
these issues.
<p><a name="N_36_">36. </a>Among the materials useful in documenting the compliance program are employee
certifications relating to training and other compliance initiatives, copies of compliance training
materials, and any corresponding reports of investigation, outcomes, and employee disciplinary
actions.  In addition, the physician practice should keep all relevant correspondence with
carriers, private payer insurers, and HCFA.
<p><a name="N_37_">37. </a>The HHS-OIG "List of Excluded Individuals/Entities" 
  provides information to health care providers, patients, and others regarding 
  individuals and entities that are excluded from participation in Federal health 
  care programs. This report, in both an on-line searchable and downloadable database, 
  can be located on the Internet at http://www.oig.hhs.gov. The OIG sanction information 
  is readily available to users in two formats on over 15,000 individuals and 
  entities currently excluded from program participation through action taken 
  by the OIG. The on-line searchable database allows users to obtain information 
  regarding excluded individuals and entities sorted by: (1) the legal bases for 
  exclusions; (2) the types of individuals and entities excluded by the OIG; and 
  (3) the States where excluded individuals reside or entities do business. In 
  addition, the General Services Administration maintains a monthly listing of 
  debarred contractors, "List of Parties Debarred from Federal Programs," at http://epls.arnet.gov/. 
<p><a name="N_38_">38. </a>HCFA also offers free online training for general fraud and abuse issues at
http://www.medicaretraining.com. See Appendix F for additional information.
<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>Another way for physician practices to receive effective training is for the physicians
and/or the employees of the practice to attend training programs offered by larger entities, such
as a hospital, a local medical society or a carrier.  This sort of collaborative effort is an excellent
way for the practice to meet the desired training objective without having to expend the
resources to develop and implement in-house training.
<p><a name="N_40_">40. </a>The OIG's work plan is currently available on the Internet at http://www.oig.hhs.gov.
The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG intends to address in the fiscal year. 
The Work Plan contains the projects of the Office of Audit Services, Office of Evaluation and
Inspections, Office of Investigations and the Office of Counsel to the Inspector General. 
<p><a name="N_41_">41. </a>Some publications, such as OIG's Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection reports,
and Advisory Opinions are readily available from the OIG and can provide a basis for
educational courses and programs for physician practice employees.  These can be obtained
through the Internet.  See Appendix F.
<p><a name="N_42_">42. </a>Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of corporate integrity agreements
that require many of these training elements.  The OIG usually requires a minimum of one hour
annually for basic training in compliance areas.  Additional training is required for specialty
fields such as claims development and billing.
<p><a name="N_43_">43. </a>In addition to whatever other method of communication is being utilized, practices
should post in a prominent area the HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number (1-800-HHS-TIPS).
See Appendix D for additional information.
<p><a name="N_44_">44. </a>Available on the OIG website at http://www.oig.hhs.gov.
<p><a name="N_45_">45. </a>See Appendix D.II. referencing the Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol for information
on how to conduct a baseline audit.
<p><a name="N_46_">46. </a>See Footnote 37 for information on how to access these lists.
<p><a name="N_47_">47. </a>Instances of noncompliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  The existence
or amount of a monetary loss to a health care program is not solely determinative of whether the
conduct should be investigated and reported to governmental authorities.  In fact, there may be
instances where there is no readily identifiable monetary loss, but corrective actions are still
necessary to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries,
e.g., where
services required by a plan of care are not provided.
<p><a name="N_48_">48. </a>The physician practice may seek advice from its legal counsel to determine the extent
of the practice's liability and to plan the appropriate course of action.
<p><a name="N_49_">49. </a> <sup>49</sup>The OIG has established a Provider Self-Disclosure 
  Protocol that encourages providers to voluntarily report suspected fraud. The 
  concept of voluntary self-disclosure is premised on a recognition that the Government 
  alone cannot protect the integrity of the Medicare and other Federal health 
  care programs. Health care providers must be willing to police themselves, correct 
  underlying problems, and work with the Government to resolve these matters. 
  The Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol can be located on the OIG's website at: 
  www.oig.hhs.gov. See Appendix D for further information on the Provider Self-Disclosure 
  Protocol.

<p><a name="N_58_">58. </a>Hospitals and physicians, including on-call physicians, who violate the statute may face
stiff penalties.  Those penalties include civil fines of up to $50,000 (or not more than $25,000 in
the case of a hospital with less than 100 beds) per violation and exclusion of a physician from
participation in the Federal health care programs.
