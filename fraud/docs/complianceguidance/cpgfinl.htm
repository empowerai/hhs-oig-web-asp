<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>

<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) continues in its efforts to promote voluntarily developed and implemented compliance
programs for the health care industry. The following compliance program guidance is
intended to assist suppliers<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of durable medical
equipment,<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> prosthetics,<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
orthotics,<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and supplies<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
(DMEPOS) and their agents and subcontractors (referred to collectively in this document as
&quot;DMEPOS suppliers&quot;) develop effective internal controls that promote adherence
to applicable Federal and State law, and the program requirements of Federal, State, and
private health plans.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> The adoption and implementation of
voluntary compliance programs significantly advance the prevention of fraud, abuse, and
waste in these health care plans while at the same time further the fundamental mission of
all DMEPOS suppliers, which is to provide quality items, service, and care to patients. </p>

<p>Within this document, the OIG first provides its general views on the value and
fundamental principles of DMEPOS suppliers' compliance programs, and then provides the
specific elements that each DMEPOS supplier should consider when developing and
implementing an effective compliance program. While this document presents basic
procedural and structural guidance for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself
a compliance program. Rather, it is a set of guidelines to be considered by a DMEPOS
supplier interested in implementing a compliance program. <br>
<br>
The OIG recognizes the size-differential that exists between operations of the different
DMEPOS suppliers and organizations that compose the DMEPOS<ins> </ins>supplier industry.
Appropriately, this guidance is pertinent for all DMEPOS<ins> </ins>suppliers, regardless of size (in
terms of employees and gross revenue); number of locations; type of equipment provided; or
corporate structure. The applicability of the recommendations and guidelines provided in
this document depends on the circumstances of each individual DMEPOS supplier. However,
regardless of a DMEPOS supplier's size or structure, the OIG believes that every DMEPOS
supplier can and should strive to accomplish the objectives and principles underlying all
of the compliance policies and procedures recommended within this guidance. </p>

<p>Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within a DMEPOS
supplier that promotes prevention, detection, and resolution of instances of conduct that
do not conform to Federal and State law, and Federal, State, and private payor health care
program requirements, as well as the DMEPOS supplier's ethical and business policies. In
practice, the compliance program should effectively articulate and demonstrate the DMEPOS
supplier's commitment to ethical conduct. Benchmarks that demonstrate implementation and
achievements are essential to any effective compliance program. Eventually, a compliance
program should become part of the fabric of routine DMEPOS supplier operations. </p>

<p>Specifically, compliance programs guide a DMEPOS supplier's owner(s), governing body (<u>e.g.</u>,
board of directors or trustees), chief executive officer (CEO), president, vice
president(s), managers, sales representatives, billing personnel, and other employees in
the efficient management and operation of a DMEPOS supplier. They are especially critical
as an internal quality assurance control in the reimbursement and payment areas, where
claims and billing operations are often the source of fraud and abuse, and therefore,
historically have been the focus of Government regulation, scrutiny, prosecution, and
sanctions. </p>

<p>It is incumbent upon a DMEPOS supplier's owner(s), corporate officers, and managers to
provide ethical leadership to the organization and to assure that adequate systems are in
place to facilitate ethical and legal conduct. Employees, managers, and the Government
will focus on the words and actions of a DMEPOS supplier's leadership as a measure of the
organization's commitment to compliance. Indeed, many DMEPOS suppliers have adopted
mission statements articulating their commitment to high ethical standards. A formal
compliance program, as an additional element in this process, offers a DMEPOS supplier a
further concrete method that may improve quality of service and reduce waste. Compliance
programs also provide a central coordinating mechanism for furnishing and disseminating
information and guidance on applicable Federal and State statutes, regulations, and
Federal, State and private health care program requirements. </p>

<p>Implementing an effective compliance program requires a substantial commitment of time,
energy, and resources by senior management and the DMEPOS supplier's governing body.<a
href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>Superficial programs that simply have the appearance of
compliance without being wholeheartedly adopted and implemented by the DMEPOS supplier or
programs that are hastily constructed and implemented without appropriate ongoing
monitoring will likely be ineffective and could expose the DMEPOS supplier to greater
liability than no program at all. Although it may require significant additional resources
or reallocation of existing resources to implement an effective compliance program, the
long term benefits of implementing the program significantly outweigh the costs.
Undertaking a voluntary compliance program is a beneficial investment that advances both
the DMEPOS supplier's organization and the stability and solvency of the Medicare program.
</p>

<p><strong>A. <u>BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes an effective compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the
public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse,
improving operational quality, improving the quality of health care services and reducing
the cost of health care. Attaining these goals provides positive results to the DMEPOS
supplier, the Government and individual citizens alike. In addition to fulfilling its
legal duty to ensure that it is not submitting false or inaccurate claims to Government
and private payors, a DMEPOS supplier may gain numerous additional benefits by voluntarily
implementing an effective compliance program. These benefits may include: 

<ul>
  <li>the formulation of effective internal controls to assure compliance with Federal and
    State statutes, rules, and regulations, and Federal, State and private payor health care
    program requirements, and internal guidelines;<br>
  </li>
  <li>a concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the DMEPOS
    supplier's strong commitment to honest and responsible corporate conduct;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior
    relating to fraud and abuse; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>an increased likelihood of identification and prevention of criminal and unethical
    conduct; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to more quickly and accurately react to employees' operational compliance
    concerns and the capability to effectively target resources to address those concerns;<br>
  </li>
  <li>improvement of the quality, efficiency, and consistency of providing services;<br>
  </li>
  <li>increased efficiency on the part of employees;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>a centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes, regulations,
    policies, and other program directives regarding fraud and abuse and related issues; <br>
  </li>
  <li>improved internal communication;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>a methodology that encourages employees to report potential problems; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of alleged misconduct by
    corporate officers, managers, sales representatives, employees, independent contractors,
    consultants, clinicians, and other health care professionals; <br>
  </li>
  <li>initiation of immediate, appropriate, and decisive corrective action;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>early detection and reporting, minimizing the loss to the Government from false claims,
    and thereby reducing the DMEPOS supplier's exposure to civil damages and penalties,
    criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion;<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
    and<br>
  </li>
  <li>enhancement of the structure of the DMEPOS supplier's operations and the consistency
    between: any related entities of the DMEPOS supplier; different departments within the
    DMEPOS supplier; the DMEPOS supplier's different locations; and the DMEPOS supplier's
    separate business units (<u>e.g.</u>, franchises, subsidiaries). </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is a sound investment on
the part of a DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the implementation of a compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud, abuse, and waste from the DMEPOS supplier's system. However, a sincere
effort by the DMEPOS supplier to comply with applicable Federal and State statutes, rules,
and regulations and Federal, State and private payor health care program requirements,
through the establishment of an effective compliance program, significantly reduces the
risk of unlawful or improper conduct. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</u></strong> </p>

<p>Given the diversity within the industry, there is no single &quot;best&quot; DMEPOS
supplier compliance program.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> The OIG understands the
variances and complexities within the DMEPOS supplier industry and is sensitive to the
differences among large national and regional DMEPOS supplier organizations, and small
independent DMEPOS suppliers. However, elements of this guidance can be used by all DMEPOS
suppliers, regardless of size (in terms of employees and gross revenue); number of
locations; type of equipment provided; or corporate structure, to establish an effective
compliance program. Similarly, a DMEPOS supplier or corporation that owns a DMEPOS
supplier or provides DMEPOS supplies may incorporate these elements into its system-wide
compliance or managerial structure. We recognize that some DMEPOS suppliers may not be
able to adopt certain elements to the same comprehensive degree that others with more
extensive resources may achieve. This guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how a
DMEPOS supplier, regardless of size, can best establish internal controls and monitor its
conduct to correct and prevent fraudulent activities. By no means should the contents of
this guidance be viewed as an exclusive discussion of the advisable elements of a
compliance program. On the contrary, the OIG strongly encourages DMEPOS suppliers to
develop and implement compliance elements that uniquely address the individual DMEPOS
supplier's risk areas. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that input and support by individuals and organizations that will
utilize the tools set forth in this document is critical to the development and success of
this compliance program guidance. In a continuing effort to collaborate closely with the
private sector, the OIG placed a notice in the Federal Register soliciting recommendations
and suggestions on what should be included in this Compliance Program Guidance.<a
href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> Further, the OIG published the draft Compliance Program
Guidance for the DME, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supply Industry in the Federal Register
for public comment.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> In addition, we considered
previous OIG publications, such as Special Fraud Alerts, Advisory Opinions,<a
href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> the findings and recommendations in reports issued by
OIG's Office of Audit Services and Office of Evaluation and Inspections, as well as the
experience of past and recent fraud investigations related to DMEPOS suppliers conducted
by OIG's Office of Investigations and the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>As appropriate, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more information and
knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the statutes, rules, regulations,
policies, and procedures of Federal, State, and private health plans occur. The OIG
understands DMEPOS suppliers will need adequate time to react to these modifications and
expansions and to make any necessary changes to their voluntary compliance programs. New
compliance practices may eventually be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG
discovers significant enhancements to better ensure an effective compliance program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the development and implementation of compliance programs in
DMEPOS suppliers often raise sensitive and complex legal and managerial issues.<a
href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is
critical guidance for providers who are sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant
health care statutes and regulations. </p>

<p>At the end of each section, where applicable, the OIG has included ideas to help aid
the small DMEPOS supplier in implementing the principles espoused in this guidance. There
is no all inclusive definition of a small DMEPOS supplier. However, as previously
mentioned, each DMEPOS supplier should tailor its compliance program according to its
resources. </p>

<p><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong> </p>

<p>The elements proposed by these guidelines are similar to those of the other OIG
Compliance Program Guidances<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> and the OIG's corporate
integrity agreements.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> The OIG believes that every
DMEPOS supplier can benefit from the principles espoused in this guidance, which can be
tailored to fit the needs and financial realities of a particular DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that every effective compliance program must begin with a formal
commitment<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> by the DMEPOS supplier's governing body to
include <u>all</u> of the applicable elements listed below, which are based on the seven
steps of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> The OIG
recognizes full implementation of all elements may not be immediately feasible for all
DMEPOS suppliers. However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful commitment on the
part of the DMEPOS supplier, especially the owner(s), governing body, president, vice
president(s), CEO, and managing employees, will substantially contribute to the program's
successful implementation. As the compliance program is implemented, that commitment
should cascade down through the management to every employee of the DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p>At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include the following seven
elements: </p>

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as
written policies and procedures that promote the DMEPOS supplier's commitment to
compliance (<u>e.g.</u>, by including adherence to the compliance program as an element in
evaluating managers and employees) and address specific areas of potential fraud, such as
the claims development and submission process, completing certificates of medical
necessity (CMNs), and financial relationships with physicians and/or other persons
authorized<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> to order DMEPOS; </p>

<p>(2) The designation of a compliance officer and other appropriate bodies, (<u>e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee), charged with the responsibility for operating and
monitoring the compliance program, and who report directly to the CEO and the governing
body;<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training for
all affected employees;<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(4) The development of effective lines of communication between the compliance officer
and all employees, including a process, such as a hotline or other reporting system, to
receive complaints, and the adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of
complainants and to protect callers from retaliation; </p>

<p>(5) The use of audits and/or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance,
identify problem areas, and assist in the reduction of identified problem areas;<a
href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> </p>

<p>(6) The development of appropriate disciplinary mechanisms to enforce standards and the
development of policies addressing (i) employees who have violated internal compliance
policies, applicable statutes, regulations, or Federal, State, or private payor health
care program requirements and (ii) the employment of sanctioned and other specified
individuals;<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> and </p>

<p>(7) The development of policies to respond to detected offenses and to initiate
corrective action to prevent similar offenses. </p>

<p><strong><u>A. WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</u></strong> </p>

<p>Every compliance program should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies, standards, and practices that identify specific areas of risk and
vulnerability to the individual DMEPOS supplier. These policies, standards, and practices
should be developed under the direction and supervision of the compliance officer and the
compliance committee (if such a committee is practicable for the DMEPOS supplier) and, at
a minimum, should be provided to all individuals who are affected by the particular policy
at issue, including the DMEPOS supplier's agents and independent contractors who may
affect billing decisions.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>In addition to these general
policies, it may be necessary to implement individual policies for the different
components of the DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p><strong>1. Standards of Conduct</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier develop standards of conduct for all
affected employees that include a clearly delineated commitment to compliance by the
DMEPOS supplier's senior management,<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> including any
related entities or affiliated providers operating under the DMEPOS supplier's control,<a
href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> and other health care professionals (<u>e.g.</u>,
nurses, licensed pharmacists, physicians, and respiratory therapists). The standards of
conduct should function in the same fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a
foundational document that details the fundamental principles, values, and framework for
action within the DMEPOS supplier. The standards should articulate the DMEPOS supplier's
commitment to comply with all Federal and State statutes, rules, regulations and Federal,
State and private payor health care program requirements, with an emphasis on preventing
fraud and abuse. They should explicitly state the organization's mission, goals, and
ethical principles relative to compliance and clearly define the DMEPOS supplier's
commitment to compliance and its expectations for all DMEPOS supplier owners, governing
body members, presidents, vice presidents, corporate officers, managers, sales
representatives, employees, and, where appropriate, independent contractors and other
agents. These standards should promote integrity, support objectivity, and foster trust.
Standards should not only address compliance with statutes and regulations, but should
also set forth broad principles that guide employees in conducting business professionally
and properly. </p>

<p>The standards should be distributed to, and comprehensible by, all affected employees (<u>e.g.</u>,
translated into other languages when necessary and written at appropriate reading levels).
Further, to assist in ensuring that employees continuously meet the expected high
standards set forth in the standards of conduct, any employee handbook delineating or
expanding upon these standards should be regularly updated as applicable statutes,
regulations, and Federal, State, and private payor health care program requirements are
modified and/or clarified.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> </p>

<p>When employees first begin working for the DMEPOS supplier, and each time new standards
of conduct are issued, the OIG suggests employees be asked to sign a statement certifying
that they have received, read, understood, and will abide by the standards of conduct. The
employee's certification should be retained by the DMEPOS supplier in the employee's
personnel file, and available for review by the compliance officer. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should operate
professionally and ethically. The OIG recognizes that small DMEPOS suppliers may not have
formal written standards of conduct. However, such unwritten standards of conduct (<u>e.g.</u>,
the manner in which the DMEPOS supplier conducts its business) should be relayed to each
employee. Employees should attest, in writing, that they understand and will abide by
these standards. </p>

<p><strong>2. Written Policies for Risk Areas</strong> </p>

<p>As part of its commitment to compliance, the DMEPOS supplier should establish a
comprehensive set of written policies and procedures that take into consideration the
particular statutes, rules, regulations, and program instructions applicable to each
function of the DMEPOS supplier.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> In contrast to the
standards of conduct, which are designed to be a clear and concise collection of
fundamental standards, the written policies should articulate specific procedures
personnel should follow. </p>

<p>Consequently, we recommend that the individual policies and procedures be coordinated
with the appropriate training and educational programs with an emphasis on areas of
special concern that have been identified by the OIG.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>
Some of the special areas of OIG concern include:<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> 

<ul>

  <li>failing to refund overpayments to a health care program;<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a></li>
  <li>failing to refund overpayments to patients;<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a></li>
  <li>improper billing resulting from a lack of communication between the DMEPOS supplier, the
    physician, and the patient;<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a> </li>
  <li>improper billing resulting from a lack of communication between different departments
    within the DMEPOS supplier;<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> and </li>
  <li>employing persons excluded from participation in Federal health care programs.<a
    href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>A DMEPOS supplier's prior history of noncompliance with applicable statutes,
regulations, and Federal, State or private health care program requirements may indicate
additional types of risk areas where the DMEPOS supplier may be vulnerable and that may
require policies and procedures to prevent recurrence.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
Additional risk areas should be assessed by the DMEPOS supplier and incorporated into its
written policies and procedures and training programs developed as part of its compliance
program. </p>

<p>The OIG believes sound operating policies are essential to all DMEPOS suppliers,
regardless of size. The OIG recommends that small DMEPOS suppliers focus on the risk areas
most potentially problematic to its business operations. The OIG recognizes some small
DMEPOS suppliers may not have the resources to independently develop a comprehensive set
of written policies and procedures pertaining to such risk areas. In this case, the OIG
recommends that the small DMEPOS supplier create a manual that is accessible to all
employees. Such a manual should contain the specific statutes, regulations, and DMERC
instructions and bulletins that address the DMEPOS supplier's identified risk areas. The
goal of this manual is to provide employees direction so they can properly address any
concerns/issues/questions that may arise. </p>

<p><strong>3. Claims Development and Submission</strong> </p>

<p><strong>a. Medical Necessity</strong> <br>
<br>
The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier's compliance program communicate to physicians
and other persons authorized to order items and services that claims submitted for items
and services will only be paid if the item or service is ordered, provided, covered,
reasonable and necessary for the patient, given his or her clinical condition. DMEPOS
suppliers should take all reasonable steps to ensure they are not submitting claims for
services that are not: (i) covered; (ii) reasonable; and (iii) necessary.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
DMEPOS suppliers must keep the treating physician's or other authorized person's signed
and dated order or CMN on file for all DMEPOS items and services.<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>
Upon a payor's request, the DMEPOS supplier must be able to provide documentation, such as
physician orders, completed original CMNs,<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a> proof of
delivery, written confirmation of verbal orders and any other documentation to support the
medical necessity of an item or service the DMEPOS supplier has provided and billed to a
Federal or private health care program.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a> Because the
DMEPOS supplier is responsible for producing documentation upon request, the DMEPOS
supplier may want to send a written notice to its clients who write orders and refer
patients concerning payors' documentation requirements. </p>

<p>As a preliminary matter, the OIG recognizes that physicians and other authorized
persons must be able to order any items or services that they believe are appropriate for
the treatment of their patients. However, Medicare and other Government and private health
care plans will only pay for those services that are covered and that meet the appropriate
medical necessity standards (<u>e.g.</u>, ordered, provided, reasonable, necessary, and
meeting criteria established by medical review policies). &quot;No payment may be made
under Part A or Part B for any expenses incurred for items or services . . . which are not
reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to
improve the functioning of a malformed body member.&quot;<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>
Therefore, DMEPOS suppliers should be aware that Medicare may deny payment for an item or
service that the treating physician or other authorized person believes is appropriate,
but which does not meet the Medicare coverage criteria or where the documentation does not
support that the item or service was reasonable and necessary for the patient. The OIG
recommends that the DMEPOS supplier advise its clients that claims for items or services
submitted for Federal, State or private payor reimbursement must meet program requirements<a
href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> or the claims may be denied. </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should take steps to ensure compliance with the applicable
statutes, regulations and the requirements of Federal, State and private health plans. The
OIG recognizes that DMEPOS suppliers do not and cannot treat patients or make medical
necessity determinations. However, the DMEPOS supplier must take steps to ensure that the
beneficiary's condition meets coverage, payment and utilization criteria established in
medical policies before it submits a claim to Federal, State or private health plans. In
order to help ensure compliance, the OIG recommends that DMEPOS supplier personnel
understand the coverage and payment criteria of each payor they bill. To help aid supplier
personnel, the DMEPOS supplier's compliance officer may want to create a clear,
comprehensive summary of the 'medical necessity' standards or coverage criteria and
applicable rules of the various Government and private plans. This summary should be
disseminated and explained to the appropriate DMEPOS supplier personnel. </p>

<p>We also recommend that DMEPOS suppliers formulate internal control mechanisms through
their written policies and procedures to ensure the medical necessity of the items or
services they provide. Such policies and procedures may include periodic claim reviews,
both prior and subsequent to billing for items and services. Such a procedure will verify
that patients are receiving and the DMEPOS supplier is being paid for items and/or
services that are ordered, provided, covered, reasonable and necessary. The DMEPOS
supplier may choose to incorporate this claims review function into pre-existing quality
assurance mechanisms. </p>

<p><strong>b. Physician Orders</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures should state that the DMEPOS
supplier will not bill for an item or service unless and until it has been ordered by the
treating physician or other authorized person. For all Medicare reimbursed DMEPOS items or
services, the DMEPOS supplier must receive a written order from the patient's treating
physician or other authorized person. Such written order must be received prior to billing
Medicare. When the DMEPOS supplier receives a verbal order, the DMEPOS supplier should
document the verbal order and must have the treating physician or other authorized person
confirm it in writing prior to billing. </p>

<p>The written policies and procedures should also state, for items requiring a written
order prior to delivery, that the order must be received by the DMEPOS supplier before it
delivers the equipment to the patient and before it bills the payor.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>c. Certificate of Medical Necessity<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a></strong>
</p>

<p>For some DMEPOS items and services, the DMEPOS supplier must receive a signed CMN from
the treating physician or other authorized person. Currently, CMNs are required for
Medicare reimbursement for fourteen items.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a> The CMN
must be retained in the DMEPOS supplier's records before it can submit a claim for payment
to the Medicare program. Although faxed CMNs are permitted in order to submit the claim,
the DMERCs have the authority to request the original CMN from the DMEPOS supplier at any
time.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Each CMN has four sections: A, B, C, and D. Section A may be completed by the DMEPOS
supplier. Section B may not be completed by the DMEPOS supplier.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>
Section B may only be completed by the treating physician, a non-physician clinician
involved in the care of the patient or a physician employee who is knowledgeable about the
patient's treatment. If section B is completed by a physician's employee, the section must
be reviewed by the treating physician or other person authorized to sign section D of the
CMN<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> to ensure the information's accuracy. Section C
must be completed by the DMEPOS supplier prior to the CMN being furnished to the treating
physician or other authorized person for signature.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>
Section D is the attestation statement and may only be signed by the treating physician or
other person authorized to sign section D.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> The DMEPOS
supplier's written policies and procedures on completing CMNs should reflect these
standards. </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should take all reasonable steps to ensure that each section of the
CMN is completed in accordance with the above guidelines. The OIG recommends that the
DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures, at a minimum, provide that the DMEPOS
supplier: 

<ul>
  <li>does not forward blank CMNs to the treating physician or other authorized person for
    signature;</li>
  <li>does not complete section B (Medical Necessity) of the CMN;</li>
  <li>does not alter or add any information on the CMN after receiving the completed and
    signed CMN from the physician or other authorized person;<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a></li>
  <li>does not sign the CMN for the treating physician or other authorized person;</li>
  <li>does not urge physicians or other authorized persons to order equipment or supplies that
    exceed what is reasonable and necessary for the patient;</li>
  <li>does not deliver an item that requires a written order from the treating physician or
    other authorized person prior to receiving the written order;<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a></li>
  <li>does not submit a claim for DMEPOS items or services prior to receiving a written order
    or CMN from the treating physician or other authorized person;</li>
  <li>does not submit a claim for DMEPOS items or services until the CMN is properly and
    correctly completed by the treating physician or other authorized person; </li>
  <li>maintains completed and signed CMNs in its files;</li>
  <li>consults with the treating physician or other authorized person who signed the CMN when
    there is a question on the order;</li>
  <li>properly complete sections A and C of the CMN and then forward the CMN to the treating
    physician or other authorized person for his/her review, information, and signature; and</li>
  <li>only submit claims for services that the treating physician or other authorized person
    attests in section D are ordered and medically necessary for the patient.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>d. Billing</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should provide in its written policies and procedures that it will
only submit to Medicare or other Federal, State or private payor health care plans claims
that are properly completed, accurate, and correctly identify the item or service ordered
by the treating physician or other authorized person and furnished to the patient. Also,
prior to submitting the claim, the DMEPOS supplier should take all reasonable steps to
ensure the item or service being claimed was provided, covered, reasonable and necessary. </p>

<p>The written policies and procedures should also clarify that a DMEPOS supplier 
  cannot submit bills or receive payment for drugs used in conjunction with DMEPOS, 
  unless the DMEPOS supplier is licensed to dispense the drug.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>e. Selection of HCPCS Codes</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures should state that only the HCPCS
code that most accurately describes the item or service ordered and provided should be
billed. The OIG views knowing 'upcoding' (<u>i.e.</u>, the selection of a code to maximize
reimbursement when such a code is not the most appropriate descriptor of the service) as
raising, among other things, false claims issues under the Civil False Claims Act.<a
href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> To ensure code accuracy, the OIG recommends that the
DMEPOS supplier include a requirement in its policies and procedures that the codes be
reviewed (random sample or certain codes) by individuals with technical expertise in
coding before claims containing such codes are submitted to the affected payor. If a
DMEPOS supplier has questions regarding the appropriate code to be used, it should contact
the Statistical Analysis Durable Medical Equipment Carrier's (SADMERC) HCPCS coding help
line.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>f. Valid Supplier Numbers</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should ensure that appropriate personnel are knowledgeable in (1)
completing the HCFA 855S supplier application;<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> and (2)
complying with the Federal requirements of 42 C.F.R. § 424.57(e) for updating supplier
number applications. </p>

<p>The written policies and procedures should state that the DMEPOS supplier should not
bill any other Federal, State, or private payor health care plan without obtaining the
necessary billing numbers and that the billing numbers will be used correctly.<a
href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Prior to applying for a valid supplier number, a DMEPOS supplier providing services to
Medicare beneficiaries must meet the supplier standards.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
The DMEPOS supplier should take all affirmative steps to ensure that no claims for
Medicare reimbursement are submitted prior to the DMEPOS supplier being issued a valid
supplier number by the National Supplier Clearinghouse. A DMEPOS supplier should not have
more than one Medicare supplier number unless it is appropriate to identify subsidiary or
regional entities under the supplier's ownership or control.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>g. Mail Order Suppliers</strong> </p>

<p>We recommend that any DMEPOS supplier who engages in the mail order supply business
clearly articulate its protocol for this segment of its business in the company's written
policies and procedures. </p>

<p>Mail order supplies should only be delivered in accordance with the treating
physician's or other authorized person's orders. Regularly shipping supplies without such
orders may lead to providing supplies substantially in excess of the patient's needs.<a
href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a> We also recommend that the supplier utilize a tracking
system so it will be able to determine whether or not the patient received the supplies
and will be able to track the location of an item or supply at any given time. </p>

<p><strong>h. Assignment</strong> </p>

<p>If a DMEPOS supplier accepts Medicare assignment, its written policies and procedures
should state that it will not charge Medicare beneficiaries more than the amounts allowed
under the Medicare fee schedule, including coinsurance and deductibles. If the beneficiary
pays the DMEPOS supplier prior to the DMEPOS supplier submitting the claim, the DMEPOS
supplier should ensure it is not charging the beneficiary more than the coinsurance on the
allowed amount under the fee schedule. In the event that the DMEPOS supplier collects
excess payments from a Medicare beneficiary, it should have mechanisms in place to
promptly refund the overpayment to the beneficiary. The DMEPOS supplier should be
knowledgeable about the Medicare rules and instructions for accepting assignment and
receiving direct payment from beneficiaries for items or services. </p>

<p>If a DMEPOS supplier chooses not to accept Medicare assignment, it is still responsible
for submitting claims to Medicare on behalf of beneficiaries.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>If the DMEPOS supplier chooses to utilize a billing agent, the DMEPOS supplier should
ensure it is complying with all of the relevant statutes and requirements governing such
an arrangement.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> The OIG strongly recommends that the
DMEPOS supplier coordinate closely with the billing company to establish compliance
responsibilities. Once the responsibilities have been clearly delineated, they should be
formalized in the written contract between the DMEPOS supplier and the billing agent. The
OIG recommends that the contract enumerate those functions that are shared
responsibilities and those that are the sole responsibility of either the billing agent or
the DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p><strong>i. Liability Issues</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that DMEPOS suppliers avoid submitting claims for items or services
that the DMEPOS supplier believes are not covered by Medicare. However, HCFA does permit a
DMEPOS supplier to submit a claim for an item or service that the DMEPOS supplier believes
is not covered if (i) the beneficiary insists that the DMEPOS supplier submit the claim,
and (ii) the DMEPOS supplier notes on the claims its belief that the service is noncovered
and that it is being submitted at the beneficiary's insistence (<u>e.g.</u>, submitted for
a Medicare determination of coverage and/or to obtain a denial notice in order to bill
other insurers).<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a> </p>

<p>A DMEPOS supplier or Medicare beneficiary is not liable for payment on assigned claims
where the beneficiary did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know,
that the payment for such services would not be made.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a>
However, when the DMEPOS supplier knew, or could have been expected to know, the items or
services would be denied, the liability for improperly paid items or services rests with
the DMEPOS supplier.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In order to protect itself from financial responsibility in such situations (<u>i.e.</u>,
situations in which the beneficiary is insisting that a claim be submitted to Medicare
notwithstanding the DMEPOS supplier's belief that Medicare does not cover the service),
the DMEPOS supplier must inform the patient prior to furnishing the item or service of the
DMEPOS supplier's belief that the claim to Medicare will be denied. In this situation, the
DMEPOS supplier should ask the patient to sign a written notice.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>
The written notice must be in writing, must clearly identify the particular item or
service, must state that the payment for the particular item or service likely will be
denied, and must give the reason(s) for the belief that payment is likely to be denied. It
is the beneficiary's decision whether or not to sign the written notice. If the
beneficiary does sign the written notice, the DMEPOS supplier should: (1) include the
appropriate modifier on the claim form; (2) maintain the written notice in its files; and
(3) be able to produce the written notice to the DMERC, upon request. </p>

<p>If the DMEPOS supplier improperly bills the beneficiary, Medicare will indemnify the
beneficiary for any payments the beneficiary made to the DMEPOS supplier, and collect the
indemnification amount from the DMEPOS supplier as an overpayment. </p>

<p>Routine notices to beneficiaries that do no more than state that denial of payment is
possible are not considered acceptable evidence of written notice. Notices should not be
given to beneficiaries unless there is some genuine doubt regarding the likelihood of
payment as evidenced by the reasons stated on the written notice. Giving notice for all
claims, items or services is not an acceptable practice. <br>
<br>
The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier include the foregoing liability issues in its
written policies and procedures. </p>

<p><strong>j. Routine Waiver of Deductibles and Coinsurance</strong> </p>

<p>Routine waivers of deductibles and coinsurance may result in false claims, civil
monetary penalties for inducements to beneficiaries, and violations of the anti-kickback
statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulations.<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a>
In addition to the potential problems regarding kickbacks, false claims, and civil
monetary penalties, the OIG has programmatic concerns when DMEPOS suppliers routinely
waive deductibles and coinsurance. When DMEPOS suppliers forgive financial obligations for
reasons other than genuine financial hardship of a particular patient, they may be
inducing the patient to use items or services that are unnecessary, simply because they
are free. Such usage may also lead to overutilization. DMEPOS suppliers are permitted to
waive the Medicare coinsurance amounts for cases of financial need.<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>
We recommend that the DMEPOS supplier develop and maintain written criteria documenting
its policy for determining financial need and consistently apply this criteria to all
cases.<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a> A good faith effort must be made to collect
deductibles and coinsurance.<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures should state that it will not
routinely waive deductibles and coinsurance for Medicare beneficiaries. The OIG recommends
that such policies and procedures should include, but not be limited to, statements that
DMEPOS supplier personnel are prohibited from: advertising an intent to waive deductibles
or coinsurance for Medicare beneficiaries; advertising an intent to discount services for
Medicare beneficiaries; or giving unsolicited advice to Medicare beneficiaries that they
need not pay. </p>

<p><strong>k. Capped Rentals</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures should address Government and
private payor requirements when providing rental equipment to beneficiaries (<u>e.g.</u>,
the purchase option<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a>and servicing and maintenance<a
href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>). The DMEPOS supplier must offer a purchase option to
beneficiaries during the 10<sup>th</sup> continuous rental month.<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a>
The DMEPOS supplier should clearly, accurately, and non-deceptively discuss the pros and
cons of the different options with the beneficiary. If the beneficiary does not accept the
purchase option, the DMEPOS supplier must continue to provide the item. After the 15<sup>th</sup>
continuous month of receiving rental payments from Medicare, providing the item or service
continues to be medically necessary, the DMEPOS supplier must continue to provide the item
without charge to the beneficiary or Medicare. </p>

<p>However, the DMEPOS supplier may submit additional claims for the maintenance and
servicing fees associated with the rental item.<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a> The
DMEPOS supplier should ensure it is performing basic safety and operational function
checks after use by each patient, and is performing routine and preventative maintenance
on equipment. The DMEPOS supplier must ensure it has qualified staff or contractors to
service, set up, and instruct the patient on the proper use of the equipment. The DMEPOS
supplier should ensure it maintains current service manuals for all the equipment it
supplies. In addition, the OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier's policies and
procedures establish an internal control system that allows the DMEPOS supplier to track
the location of each piece of equipment at any given time. </p>

<p>The policies and procedures should also address the guidelines for determining
continuous use and criteria for a new rental period.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>
If a beneficiary dies during a rental period, the DMEPOS supplier may receive the entire
monthly rental payment.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a> However, if the DMEPOS
supplier continues to bill for the item because it did not receive notice of the
beneficiary's death until the following month, any payments received for rental items the
month after the beneficiary dies are considered an overpayment and must promptly be
refunded. The DMEPOS supplier should create internal mechanisms to ensure the correct
rental month appears on the claim and the correct modifier is used. </p>

<p>In addition, the DMEPOS supplier should ensure it is not submitting claims for rental
equipment when the beneficiary is residing in an institution. The OIG is aware that some
DMEPOS suppliers bring DMEPOS items to beneficiaries residing in an institution, just
prior to the beneficiary's discharge, in order to train the beneficiary on how to use the
item or to fit the item for the beneficiary. Once the DMEPOS supplier has trained or
fitted the beneficiary, the DMEPOS supplier should take the item and deliver it to the
beneficiary's home on the date of discharge. As a result, the DMEPOS supplier should file
the claim for this item with the date of delivery/date of service as the date the
beneficiary is discharged from the institution. If the DMEPOS supplier delivers the item
to the beneficiary in the institution prior to the beneficiary's discharge to be used by
the beneficiary while in the institution, the item should be included in the institution's
cost and the DMEPOS supplier should not submit the claim. The DMEPOS supplier may not
submit the claim prior to the beneficiary's date of discharge. </p>

<p><strong>l. ZX Modifier</strong> </p>

<p>The ZX modifier is used on the claim form to indicate that the DMEPOS supplier is
maintaining medical necessity documentation in its files. Such documentation only needs to
be submitted to the DMERC upon request. </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should create internal mechanisms to ensure the proper use of the
ZX modifier. Improper use of the modifier may result in the submission of false claims.
The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures address the
DMEPOS supplier's protocol for using the ZX modifier.<a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>m. Cover Letters</strong> </p>

<p>Cover letters are commonly used by the DMEPOS supplier as a method of communication
between the DMEPOS supplier and the treating physician or other authorized person. The
cover letter is not a form required or regulated by the Government. As a result, the
DMERCs do not base Medicare denials solely on what may be considered inappropriate use of
cover letters. However, the OIG is concerned that cover letters may influence or direct a
physician's or other authorized person's answers on the CMN, particularly the questions
relating to the patient's medical condition.<a href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a> It is
the treating physician's or other authorized person's responsibility to determine both the
medical need for, and the utilization of, health care services. The OIG encourages the
DMEPOS supplier to include language in its cover letter to remind treating physicians and
other authorized persons of their responsibilities in properly completing CMNs. </p>

<p><strong>n. Communication</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG suggests that the DMEPOS supplier create mechanisms that increase the
communication among treating physicians or other authorized persons who refer business to
the DMEPOS supplier, the patients, and the DMEPOS supplier. We recommend that such
mechanisms be included in the DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures. Such
mechanisms may include: (i) the DMEPOS supplier periodically calling the patient to ensure
the equipment is still being used and is operating properly; or (ii) periodically calling
the treating physician to ensure the provided items continue to be medically necessary for
a patient. </p>

<p>In addition, we recommend the DMEPOS supplier create mechanisms to ensure communication
between different departments (<u>e.g.</u>, sales and billing) in order to prevent the
filing of incorrect claims. </p>

<p><strong>o. Oxygen and Oxygen Equipment</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that the written policies and procedures for DMEPOS suppliers
furnishing oxygen state that the DMEPOS supplier will ensure that initial claims for
oxygen therapy include the written results of an arterial blood gas study or oximetry test
(on the CMN) that has been ordered and evaluated by the patient's treating physician.
Further, the written policies and procedures should provide for the DMEPOS supplier to
maintain such test results and any other independent diagnostic treatment facility (IDTF)
documents supporting the patient's medical necessity for the oxygen. The OIG recommends
that the DMEPOS supplier have the IDTFs, from which it receives test results, submit, all
raw test results to the treating physician for the physician's benefit, and not just a
summary of the results. The written policies and procedures should provide that a DMEPOS
supplier is not qualified to conduct the blood gas study or to prescribe the oxygen
therapy.<a href="#N_120_"><sup>(120)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG also recommends, for patient safety purposes, that the rental of oxygen include
established maintenance safeguards and that steps are taken to ensure the equipment is
properly maintained, as maintenance is included in the rental price of the equipment. </p>

<p>When submitting an oxygen or oxygen equipment claim for reimbursement, the DMEPOS
supplier must ensure it is complying with the payment rules.<a href="#N_121_"><sup>(121)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>4</strong>.<strong>Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Concerns</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier should have policies and procedures in place with respect to
compliance with Federal and State laws, including the anti-kickback statute, as well as
the Stark physician self-referral law.<a href="#N_122_"><sup>(122)</sup></a> Such policies
should provide that: 

<ul>
  <li>all of the DMEPOS supplier's contracts and arrangements with actual or potential
    referral sources (<u>e.g.</u>, physicians) are reviewed by counsel and comply with all
    applicable statutes and regulations, including the anti-kickback statute and the Stark
    physician self-referral law;<a href="#N_123_"><sup>(123)</sup></a> </li>
  <li>the DMEPOS supplier will not submit or cause to be submitted to health care programs
    claims for patients who were referred to the DMEPOS supplier pursuant to contracts or
    financial arrangements that were designed to induce such referrals in violation of the
    anti-kickback statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulation or that otherwise
    violate the Stark physician self-referral law; </li>
  <li>a DMEPOS supplier does not offer a physician or other referral source more than fair
    market value for space rented to store items or supplies (<u>i.e.</u>, consignment
    closet); and</li>
  <li>the DMEPOS supplier does not offer or provide gifts, free services, or other incentives
    or things of value to patients, relatives of patients, physicians, home health agencies,
    nursing homes, hospitals, contractors, assisted living facilities, or other potential
    referral sources for the purpose of inducing referrals in violation of the anti-kickback
    statute or similar Federal or State statute or regulation.<a href="#N_124_"><sup>(124)</sup></a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further, the OIG recommends that the written policies and procedures should
specifically reference and take into account the OIG's safe harbor regulations, which
describe those payment practices that are immune from criminal and administrative
prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_125_"><sup>(125)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should be concerned with
potential anti-kickback and Stark violations. As a result, all DMEPOS suppliers should be
knowledgeable about, and compliant with, the anti-kickback statute, the Stark physician
self-referral law and other relevant Federal and State statutes or regulations. </p>

<p>Although all DMEPOS suppliers are responsible for ensuring compliance with these
provisions, the OIG recognizes that the small DMEPOS supplier may not have the resources
to implement the suggestions in this section to the same extent as a large DMEPOS
supplier. Therefore, the smaller DMEPOS supplier may need to employ a slightly different
mechanism to ensure compliance. For example, the small DMEPOS supplier may want to choose
a sample of contracts or financial arrangements to review on a periodic basis. </p>

<p><strong>5. Marketing </strong></p>

<p>Where marketing is permitted, the DMEPOS supplier's compliance program should require
honest, straightforward, fully informative and non-deceptive marketing. It is in the best
interest of patients, DMEPOS suppliers, physicians and health care programs that
physicians or other persons authorized to order DMEPOS fully understand the services
offered by the DMEPOS supplier, the items or services that will be provided when ordered,
and the financial consequences for Medicare as well as other payors for the items or
services ordered. The OIG recommends that if the DMEPOS supplier services a large number
of non-English speaking patients, it should ensure that its marketing materials are
available in those other languages. The DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures
should ensure that its marketing information is clear, correct, and fully informative. </p>

<p>Salespeople must not offer physicians, patients or other potential referral sources
incentives, in cash or in kind, for their business.<a href="#N_126_"><sup>(126)</sup></a>
Similarly, they must not engage in any marketing activity that either explicitly or
implicitly implies that Medicare beneficiaries are not obligated to pay their coinsurance
or can receive &quot;free&quot; services.<a href="#N_127_"><sup>(127)</sup></a> In
addition, DMEPOS suppliers must not promote items or services to patients or physicians
that are not reasonable or necessary for the treatment of the individual patient. The OIG
suggests that the DMEPOS supplier's written policies and procedures create internal
mechanisms to avoid these situations. </p>

<p>With respect to marketing and sales, the OIG has a longstanding concern that percentage
compensation arrangements for sales and marketing personnel may increase the risk of such
persons violating the anti-kickback statute.<a href="#N_128_"><sup>(128)</sup></a> The OIG
recommends that the DMEPOS supplier monitor its sales representatives on a regular basis (<u>e.g.</u>,
rotate sales staff or send a sales manager on some sales calls). </p>

<p>DMEPOS suppliers are prohibited from making unsolicited telephone contacts to Medicare
beneficiaries.<a href="#N_129_"><sup>(129)</sup></a> We suggest that the DMEPOS supplier's
written policies and procedures reflect this prohibition. </p>

<p>DMEPOS suppliers are also prohibited from using symbols, emblems, or names in reference
to Social Security or Medicare in a manner that they know or should know would convey the
false impression that an item is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Social Security
Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration, or the Department of Health and
Human Services or that the supplier has some connection with, or authorization from, any
of these agencies.<a href="#N_130_"><sup>(130)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The OIG believes marketing strategies employed by all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of
size, should be clear, correct, honest, straightforward, non-deceptive and fully
informative. In addition, all DMEPOS suppliers should inform their sales people of
potential anti-kickback concerns, the telemarketing law, and the prohibition on
inappropriately using references to Social Security and Medicare. Although the small
DMEPOS supplier may not have extensive written policies and procedures, every DMEPOS
supplier should ensure that its employees are clear on what is permitted and prohibited
with regard to marketing. </p>

<p><strong>6. Retention of Records</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's compliance program should provide for the implementation of a
records system. The DMEPOS supplier should ensure that records are maintained for the
length of time required by Federal and State law and private payors, or by the DMEPOS
supplier's record retention policies, whichever is longer. This system should establish
policies and procedures regarding the creation, distribution, retention, storage,
retrieval, and destruction of documents.<a href="#N_131_"><sup>(131)</sup></a>The three
types of documents developed under this system should include: (1) all records and
documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, billing and claims documentation) required either by Federal
or State law and the program requirements of Federal, State, and private health plans; (2)
records listing the persons responsible for implementing each part of the compliance
program; and (3) all records necessary to protect the integrity of the DMEPOS supplier's
compliance process and confirm the effectiveness of the program.<a href="#N_132_"><sup>(132)</sup></a>
The documentation necessary to satisfy the third requirement includes, but is not limited
to: evidence of adequate employee training; reports from the DMEPOS supplier's hotline;
results of any investigation conducted as a consequence of a hotline call; modifications
to the compliance program; self-disclosure; all written notifications to physicians and
payors;<a href="#N_133_"><sup>(133)</sup></a> and the results of the DMEPOS supplier's
auditing and monitoring efforts. </p>

<p>All DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, must retain documents required by the health
plans in which they participate. In case of a future Government investigation, the OIG
recommends that all DMEPOS suppliers retain documents relating to the implementation of
their compliance programs. </p>

<p><strong>7. Compliance as an Element of a Performance Plan</strong> </p>

<p>The DMEPOS supplier's compliance program should require that the promotion of, and
adherence to, the elements of the compliance program be a factor in evaluating the
performance of all employees. Employees should be periodically trained in new compliance
policies and procedures. In addition, all managers and supervisors should: 

<ul>
  <li>discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance policies
    and legal requirements applicable to their function; </li>
  <li>inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
    requirements is a condition of employment; and </li>
  <li>disclose to all supervised personnel that the DMEPOS supplier will take disciplinary
    action up to and including termination for violation of these policies or requirements. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to making performance of these duties an element in evaluations, the
compliance officer or DMEPOS supplier management should include a policy that managers and
supervisors will be sanctioned for failing to instruct adequately their subordinates or
for failing to detect noncompliance with applicable policies and legal requirements, where
reasonable diligence on the part of the manager or supervisor would have led to the
discovery of any problems or violations. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should ensure their
employees understand the importance of compliance. If the small DMEPOS supplier does not
have a formal performance evaluation structure, it should informally convey the employee's
compliance responsibilities and the importance of these responsibilities. </p>

<p><strong><u>B. DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>Every DMEPOS supplier should designate a compliance officer to serve as the focal point
for compliance activities. The compliance officer should be a person of high integrity.
This responsibility may be the individual's sole duty or added to other management
responsibilities, depending upon the size and resources of the DMEPOS supplier and the
complexity of the task. When a compliance officer has other duties, the other duties
should not be in conflict with the compliance goals.<a href="#N_134_"><sup>(134)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate authority is critical to the
success of the program, necessitating the appointment of a high-level official in the
DMEPOS supplier with direct access to the DMEPOS supplier's owner(s), president or CEO,
governing body, all other senior management, and legal counsel.<a href="#N_135_"><sup>(135)</sup></a>
The compliance officer should be highly enough placed in the company so that he or she can
exercise independent judgment without fear of reprisal, and so that employees will know
that bringing a problem to that person's attention is not a wasted exercise. The
compliance officer should have sufficient funding and staff to fully perform his or her
responsibilities. Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance
officer with regard to planning, implementing, and monitoring the compliance program. </p>

<p>The compliance officer's primary responsibilities should include: 

<ul>
  <li>overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program;<a href="#N_136_"><sup>(136)</sup></a></li>
  <li>Reporting on a regular basis to the DMEPOS supplier's owner(s), governing body, CEO,
    president, and compliance committee (if applicable) on the progress of implementation, and
    assisting these components in establishing methods to improve the DMEPOS supplier's
    efficiency and quality of services, and to reduce the DMEPOS supplier's vulnerability to
    fraud, abuse, and waste;</li>
  <li>periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs, and
    in the statutes, rules, regulations, and requirements of Federal, State, and private payor
    health care plans;</li>
  <li>reviewing employees' certifications that they have received, read, understood, and will
    abide by the standards of conduct;</li>
  <li>developing, coordinating, and participating in a multifaceted educational and training
    program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program, and seeks to ensure that
    all appropriate employees and managers are knowledgeable of, and comply with, pertinent
    Federal, State and private payor health care program requirements;</li>
  <li>ensuring independent contractors and agents who provide services (<u>e.g.</u>, billing
    companies, delivery services and sources of referrals, <u>i.e.</u>, physicians and others)
    to the DMEPOS supplier are aware of the requirements of the DMEPOS supplier's compliance
    program with respect to coverage, billing, marketing, and kickbacks, among other things;</li>
  <li>coordinating personnel issues with the DMEPOS supplier's Human Resources/Personnel
    office (or its equivalent). The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier check the List of
    Excluded Individuals/Entities,<a href="#N_137_"><sup>(137)</sup></a> and the General
    Services Administration's List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and
    Nonprocurement Programs<a href="#N_138_"><sup>(138)</sup></a> to ensure employees and
    independent contractors have not been excluded or debarred from participating in Federal
    programs.<a href="#N_139_"><sup>(139)</sup></a> Depending upon State requirements or
    DMEPOS supplier policy, the Compliance Officer may also conduct a criminal background
    check of employees;</li>
  <li>assisting the DMEPOS supplier's financial management in coordinating internal compliance
    review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of departments;</li>
  <li>independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including the
    flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding to
    reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action (<u>e.g.</u>,
    making necessary improvements to DMEPOS supplier policies and practices, taking
    appropriate disciplinary action, etc.) with all DMEPOS supplier departments, independent
    contractors, and health care professionals; </li>
  <li>developing policies and programs that encourage managers and employees to report
    suspected fraud and other improprieties without fear of retaliation; and</li>
  <li>continuing the momentum of the compliance program and the accomplishment of its
    objectives long after the initial years of implementation.<a href="#N_140_"><sup>(140)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other
information that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to,
patient records (where appropriate), billing records, and DMEPOS supplier records
concerning the marketing efforts of the DMEPOS supplier and the DMEPOS supplier's
arrangements with other parties, including employees, home health agencies, skilled
nursing facilities, and treating physicians or other authorized persons. This policy
enables the compliance officer to review contracts and obligations (seeking the advice of
legal counsel, where appropriate) that may contain referral and payment provisions that
could violate the anti-kickback statute, as well as the Stark physician self-referral
prohibition or other statutory or regulatory requirements. </p>

<p>In addition, the compliance officer should be copied on the results of all internal
audit reports and work closely with key managers to identify aberrant trends in the coding
and billing areas. The compliance officer should ascertain patterns that require a change
in policy and forward these issues to the compliance committee to remedy the problem. The
compliance officer should have full authority to stop the processing of claims that he or
she believes are problematic until such time as the issue in question has been resolved. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should have a compliance
officer or contact who possesses a high degree of integrity, is knowledgeable about the
rules, regulations, and policies under which the DMEPOS supplier operates and has
sufficient authority to exercise independent judgment. A small DMEPOS supplier may not
have the need or the resources to hire/appoint a full time compliance officer. However,
each DMEPOS supplier should have a person in its organization (this person may have other
functional responsibilities) who can oversee the DMEPOS supplier's compliance with respect
to applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and policies. The structure and
comprehensiveness of the DMEPOS supplier's compliance program will help determine the
responsibilities of each individual compliance officer. </p>

<p><strong>2. Compliance Committee</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends, where feasible, that a compliance committee be established to
advise the compliance officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a
href="#N_141_"><sup>(141)</sup></a> When assembling a team of people to serve as the
DMEPOS supplier's compliance committee, the DMEPOS supplier should include individuals
with a variety of skills.<a href="#N_142_"><sup>(142)</sup></a> The OIG strongly
recommends that the compliance officer manage the compliance committee. Once a DMEPOS
supplier chooses the people that will accept the responsibilities vested in members of the
compliance committee, the DMEPOS supplier must train these individuals on the policies and
procedures of the compliance program, as well as how to discharge their duties. </p>

<p>The committee's responsibilities should include: 

<ul>
  <li>analyzing the organization's regulatory environment, the legal requirements with which
    it must comply,<a href="#N_143_"><sup>(143)</sup></a> and specific risk areas;</li>
  <li>assessing existing policies and procedures that address these risk areas for possible
    incorporation into the compliance program;</li>
  <li>working with appropriate DMEPOS supplier departments to develop standards of conduct and
    policies and procedures that promote allegiance to the DMEPOS supplier's compliance
    program;</li>
  <li>recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
    development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's standards,
    policies, and procedures as part of its daily operations;<a href="#N_144_"><sup>(144)</sup></a></li>
  <li>determining the appropriate strategy/approach to promote compliance with the program and
    detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other fraud reporting
    mechanisms;</li>
  <li>developing a system to solicit, evaluate, and respond to complaints and problems; and</li>
  <li>monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
    identifying troublesome issues and deficient areas experienced by the DMEPOS supplier, and
    implementing corrective and preventive action. </li>
</ul>

<p>The committee may also address other functions as the compliance concept becomes part
of the overall DMEPOS supplier's operating structure and daily routine. </p>

<p>The compliance committee is an extension of the compliance officer and provides the
organization with increased oversight. The OIG recognizes that small DMEPOS suppliers may
not have the resources or the need to establish a compliance committee. However, when
potential problems are identified, the OIG recommends that the small DMEPOS supplier
create a &quot;taskforce,&quot; if appropriate, to address the problem. The members of the
taskforce may vary depending upon the issue. </p>

<p><strong>C. <u>CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Initial Training in Compliance</strong> </p>

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, employees and the
continual retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant elements of an
effective compliance program. In order to ensure the appropriate information is being
disseminated to the correct individuals, the training should be separated into sessions.
All employees should attend the general session on compliance, and employees whose job
primarily focuses on submission of claims for reimbursement, or who are involved in sales
and marketing, should receive additional training on these particular subjects. In
addition, the OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier inform physicians, independent
contractors, and significant agents that it has implemented a compliance program. <br>
<strong><br>
a. General Sessions</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends, as part of its compliance program, that the DMEPOS supplier require
all affected personnel to attend training on an annual basis, including appropriate
training in Federal and State statutes, regulations and guidelines, HCFA manual
instructions, DMERC medical review policies, the policies of private payors, and training
in corporate ethics. The general training session should emphasize the DMEPOS supplier's
commitment to compliance with these legal requirements and policies. </p>

<p>These training programs should include sessions highlighting the DMEPOS supplier's
compliance program, summarizing fraud and abuse statutes and regulations, Federal, State
and private payor health care program requirements, claim submission procedures and
marketing practices that reflect current legal and program standards. The DMEPOS supplier
must take steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all affected
employees (<u>e.g.</u>, by requiring participation in training programs and disseminating
publications that explain specific requirements in a practical manner).<a href="#N_145_"><sup>(145)</sup></a>
DMEPOS suppliers may also wish to offer such training sessions to interested independent
contractors and physicians. Managers of specific departments can assist in identifying
areas that require training and in carrying out such training.<a href="#N_146_"><sup>(146)</sup></a>
Training instructors may come from outside or inside the organization. New employees
should be targeted for training early in their employment.<a href="#N_147_"><sup>(147)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>As part of the initial training, the standards of conduct should be distributed to all
employees.<a href="#N_148_"><sup>(148)</sup></a>At the end of this training session, every
employee should be required to sign and date a statement that reflects his or her
knowledge of and commitment to the standards of conduct. This attestation should be
retained in the employee's personnel file. </p>

<p>Further, to assist in ensuring that employees continuously meet the expected high
standards of conduct, any employee handbook delineating or expanding upon these standards
should be regularly updated as applicable statutes, regulations and Federal health care
program requirements are modified.<a href="#N_149_"><sup>(149)</sup></a> The DMEPOS
supplier should<a name="training 2"></a> provide an additional attestation in the modified
standards that stipulates the employee's knowledge of and commitment to the modifications.
</p>

<p><strong>b. Claim Development and Billing Training</strong> </p>

<p>In addition to specific training in the risk areas identified in section II.A.2, above,
primary training to appropriate corporate officers, managers and other claim development
and billing staff should include such topics as: 

<ul>
  <li>specific Government and private payor reimbursement principles;<a href="#N_150_"><sup>(150)</sup></a></li>
  <li>providing and billing DMEPOS items or services without proper authorization;</li>
  <li>proper documentation of services rendered, including the correct application of official
    ICD-9 and HCPCS coding rules and guidelines;</li>
  <li>improper alterations to documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, patient records, CMNs);</li>
  <li>compliance with the Federal, State, and private payor supplier standards; and</li>
  <li>duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational
programs are particularly relevant to a DMEPOS supplier's billing and coding personnel, in
that the pressure to meet business goals may render employees vulnerable to engaging in
prohibited practices. </p>

<p><strong>c. Sales and Marketing Training</strong> </p>

<p>In addition to specific training in the risk areas identified in section II.A.2, above,
primary training to sales and marketing personnel should include such topics as: 

<ul>
  <li>general prohibition on paying or receiving renumeration to induce referrals;</li>
  <li>routine waiver of deductibles and/or coinsurance;</li>
  <li>disguising referral fees as salaries;</li>
  <li>offering free items or services to induce referrals;</li>
  <li>high pressure marketing of noncovered or unnecessary services;</li>
  <li>improper patient solicitation; and </li>
  <li>duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational
programs are particularly relevant to a DMEPOS supplier's sales and marketing personnel,
in that the pressure to meet business goals may render employees vulnerable to engaging in
prohibited practices. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should ensure that their
employees are well trained and are abiding by the applicable statutes, regulations, and
policies. Each employee should know the procedures or who to consult when confronted with
a particular situation. </p>

<p><strong>2. Format of the Training Program</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG suggests that all relevant levels of personnel be made part of various
educational and training programs of the DMEPOS supplier.<a href="#N_151_"><sup>(151)</sup></a>
Employees should be required to have a minimum number of educational hours per year, as
appropriate, as part of their employment obligations.<a href="#N_152_"><sup>(152)</sup></a>
For example, as discussed above, employees involved in billing functions should be
required to attend periodic training in applicable reimbursement coverage and
documentation of records.<a href="#N_153_"><sup>(153)</sup></a> </p>

<p>A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training and training in several
different languages, particularly where a DMEPOS supplier has a culturally diverse staff,
should be implemented so that all affected employees are knowledgeable about the DMEPOS
supplier's standards of conduct and procedures for alerting senior management to problems
and concerns.<a href="#N_154_"><sup>(154)</sup></a> Targeted training should be provided
to corporate officers, managers and other employees whose actions affect the accuracy of
the claims submitted to the Government, such as employees involved in the coding, billing,
sales, and marketing processes. All training materials should be designed to take into
account the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual trainees. Given the
complexity and interdependent relationships of many departments, it is important for the
compliance officer to supervise and coordinate the training program. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that attendance and participation in training programs be made a
condition of continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements
should result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is
serious. Adherence to the provisions of the compliance program, such as training
requirements, should be a factor in the annual evaluation of each employee. The DMEPOS
supplier should retain adequate records of its training of employees, including attendance
logs and material distributed at training sessions. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes the format of the training program will vary depending upon the
resources of the DMEPOS supplier. For example, a small DMEPOS supplier may want to create
a video for each type of training session so new employees can receive training in a
timely manner. </p>

<p><strong>3. Continuing Education on Compliance Issues</strong> </p>

<p>It is essential that compliance issues remain at the forefront of the DMEPOS supplier's
priorities. The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier's compliance program address the
need for periodic professional education courses for DMEPOS supplier personnel. In
particular, the DMEPOS supplier should ensure that coding personnel receive annual
professional training on the updated codes for the current year and have knowledge of the
SADMERC's HCPCS coding helpline.<a href="#N_155_"><sup>(155)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In order to maintain a sense of seriousness about compliance in a DMEPOS supplier's
operations, the DMEPOS supplier must continue to disseminate the compliance message. One
effective mechanism for maintaining a consistent presence of the compliance message is to
publish a monthly newsletter to address compliance concerns. This would allow the DMEPOS
supplier to address specific examples of problems the company encountered during its
ongoing audits and risk analyses, while reinforcing the DMEPOS supplier's firm commitment
to the general principles of compliance and ethical conduct. The newsletter could also
include the risk areas published by the OIG in its Special Fraud Alerts. Finally, the
DMEPOS supplier could use the newsletter as a mechanism to address areas of ambiguity in
the coding and billing process and/or its sales and marketing practices. The DMEPOS
supplier should maintain its newsletters in a central location to document the guidance
offered, and provide new employees with access to guidance previously provided. </p>

<p>The OIG believes it is important that all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size,
maintain knowledgeable employees. The OIG recognizes that regularly sending employees to
continuing education classes or publishing newsletters may not be feasible for small
DMEPOS suppliers. Small DMEPOS suppliers may have their employees meet on a regular basis
to discuss information in the DMERC's Medicare bulletin (<u>e.g.</u>, coding changes,
procedural changes, policy changes, etc.). Such regularly held meetings will help
demonstrate the DMEPOS supplier's commitment to compliance. </p>

<p><strong>D. <u>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and DMEPOS supplier
employees is equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program
and the reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse, and waste. Written confidentiality
and non-retaliation policies should be developed and distributed to all employees to
encourage communication and the reporting of incidents of potential fraud.<a
href="#N_156_"><sup>(156)</sup></a> The compliance committee should also develop several
independent reporting paths for an employee to report fraud, waste, or abuse so that such
reports cannot be diverted by supervisors or other personnel. </p>

<p>The OIG encourages the establishment of a procedure for personnel to seek clarification
from the compliance officer or members of the compliance committee in the event of any
confusion or question regarding a DMEPOS supplier policy, practice, or procedure.
Questions and responses should be documented and dated and, if appropriate, shared with
other staff so that standards, policies, practices, and procedures can be updated and
improved to reflect any necessary changes or clarifications. The compliance officer may
want to solicit employee input in developing these communication and reporting systems. </p>

<p><strong>2. Hotlines</strong> <strong>and Other Forms of Communication</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG encourages the use of hotlines,<a href="#N_157_"><sup>(157)</sup></a> e-mails,
written memoranda, newsletters, suggestion boxes, and other forms of information exchange
to maintain these open lines of communication.<a href="#N_158_"><sup>(158)</sup></a> If
the DMEPOS supplier establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be made readily
available to all employees and independent contractors, possibly by circulating the number
on wallet cards or conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a
href="#N_159_"><sup>(159)</sup></a> Employees should be permitted to report matters on an
anonymous basis.<strong> </strong>Matters reported through the hotline or other
communication sources that suggest substantial violations of compliance policies, Federal,
State or private payor health care program requirements, regulations, or statutes should
be documented and investigated promptly to determine their veracity. A log should be
maintained by the compliance officer that records such calls, including the nature of any
investigation and its results.<a href="#N_160_"><sup>(160)</sup></a> Such information
should be included in reports to the owner(s), governing body, CEO, president, and
compliance committee.<a href="#N_161_"><sup>(161)</sup></a> Further, while the DMEPOS
supplier should always strive to maintain the confidentiality of an employee's identity,
it should also explicitly communicate that there may be a point where the individual's
identity may become known or may have to be revealed. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by employees who may have
participated n illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex legal
and management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The compliance
officer should work closely with legal counsel, who can provide guidance regarding such
issues. <br>
<br>
The OIG recognizes that protecting anonymity may be infeasible for small DMEPOS suppliers.
However, the OIG believes all DMEPOS supplier employees, when seeking answers to questions
or reporting potential instances of fraud and abuse, should know who to consult and should
be able to do so without fear of retribution. </p>

<p><strong>E.<u> AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong> </p>

<p>An ongoing evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program. The OIG
believes that an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of its
implementation and regular reporting to the DMEPOS supplier's corporate officers.<a
href="#N_162_"><sup>(162)</sup></a> Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring,
including reports of suspected noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance
officer and shared with the DMEPOS supplier's corporate officers and the compliance
committee. The extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors
such as the size of the DMEPOS supplier, the resources available to the DMEPOS supplier,
the DMEPOS supplier's prior history of noncompliance, and the risk factors that are
prevalent in a particular DMEPOS supplier. </p>

<p>Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and
ensure compliance is the performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or
external auditors who have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes, rules,
regulations, and Federal, State and private payor health care program requirements. The
audits should focus on the different departments within the DMEPOS supplier, including
external relationships with third-party contractors. At a minimum, these audits should be
designed to address the DMEPOS supplier's compliance with laws governing kickback
arrangements, the physician self-referral prohibition, pricing, contracts, claim
development and submission, reimbursement, sales and marketing. In addition, the audits
and reviews should examine the DMEPOS supplier's compliance with the Federal, State, and
private payor supplier standards and the specific rules and policies that have been the
focus of particular attention on the part of the Medicare DMERCs, and law enforcement, as
evidenced by educational and other communications from OIG Special Fraud Alerts, Advisory
Opinions, OIG audits and evaluations, and law enforcement's initiatives.<a href="#N_163_"><sup>(163)</sup></a>
In addition, the DMEPOS supplier should focus on any areas of specific concern identified
within that DMEPOS supplier and those that may have been identified by any entity, whether
Federal, State, private or internal. </p>

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer
to identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_164_"><sup>(164)</sup></a>
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine
the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for
legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer and DMEPOS supplier management may
want to limit any corrective action or take no action. If it is determined that the
deviation was caused by improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including fraud
and systemic problems, the DMEPOS supplier should take prompt steps to correct the
problem.<a href="#N_165_"><sup>(165)</sup></a> Any overpayments discovered as a result of
such deviations should be returned promptly to the affected payor. The OIG recommends
sending the payor the following information with the overpayment: (1) that the refund is
being made pursuant to a voluntary compliance program; (2) a description of the complete
causes and circumstances surrounding the overpayment; (3) the methodology by which the
overpayment was determined; (4) the amount of the overpayment; and (5) any claim-specific
information, reviewed as part of the self-audit, used to determine the overpayment (<u>e.g.</u>,
beneficiary health insurance claims number, claim number, date of service, and payment
date). Inclusion of such information with the overpayment will aid the payor in making the
adjustment and may prevent it from requesting additional information. </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at least annual)
reviews of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>,
whether there has been appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, training,
ongoing educational programs, and disciplinary actions, among other elements.<a
href="#N_166_"><sup>(166)</sup></a> This process will verify actual conformance by all
departments with the compliance program and may identify the necessity for improvements to
be made to the compliance program, as well as the DMEPOS supplier's operations. Such
reviews could support a determination that appropriate records have been created and
maintained to document the implementation of an effective program.<a href="#N_167_"><sup>(167)</sup></a>
However, when monitoring discloses that deviations were not detected in a timely manner
due to program deficiencies, appropriate modifications must be implemented. Such
evaluations, when developed with the support of management, can help ensure compliance
with the DMEPOS supplier's policies and procedures. </p>

<p>As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider
techniques such as: 

<ul>
  <li>testing billing staff on their knowledge of reimbursement coverage criteria and official
    coding guidelines (<u>e.g.</u>, present hypothetical scenarios of situations experienced
    in daily practice and assess responses);</li>
  <li>on-site visits to all facilities and locations;</li>
  <li>ongoing risk analysis and vulnerability assessments of the DMEPOS supplier's operations;</li>
  <li>assessment of existing relationships with physicians, and other potential referral
    sources;</li>
  <li>unannounced audits, mock surveys, and investigations;</li>
  <li>examination of the DMEPOS supplier's complaint logs;</li>
  <li>checking personnel records to determine whether any individuals who have been
    reprimanded for compliance issues in the past are among those currently engaged in
    improper conduct; </li>
  <li>interviews with personnel involved in management, operations, sales and marketing, claim
    development and submission, and other related activities;</li>
  <li>questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of the DMEPOS supplier's employees;</li>
  <li>interviews with physicians or other authorized persons who order services provided by
    the DMEPOS supplier;</li>
  <li>interviews with independent contractors who provide services to the DMEPOS supplier;</li>
  <li>reviews of medical necessity documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, physicians orders, CMNs), and
    other documents that support claims for reimbursement;</li>
  <li>validation of qualifications of physicians or other authorized persons who order
    services provided by the DMEPOS supplier; </li>
  <li>evaluation of written materials and documentation outlining the DMEPOS supplier's
    policies and procedures; and </li>
  <li>utilization/trend analyses that uncover deviations, positive or negative, for specific
    HCPCS codes or types of items over a given period. </li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewers should: 

<ul>
  <li>possess the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential
    issues with the subject matter to be reviewed;</li>
  <li>be objective and independent of line management;<a href="#N_168_"><sup>(168)</sup></a></li>
  <li>have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel, and all
    relevant areas of operation;</li>
  <li>present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the owner(s), president,
    CEO, governing body, and members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but not
    less than annually; and</li>
  <li>specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed. </li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend that these audit reports be prepared and submitted to the compliance
officer and senior management to ensure they are aware of the results. We suggest the
reports specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed. With these
reports, DMEPOS supplier management can take whatever steps are necessary to correct past
problems and prevent them from recurring. In certain cases, subsequent reviews or studies
would be advisable to ensure that the recommended corrective actions have been implemented
successfully. </p>

<p>A DMEPOS supplier should document its efforts to comply with applicable Federal and
State statutes, rules, and regulations, and Federal, State, and private payor health care
program requirements. For example, where a DMEPOS supplier, in its efforts to comply with
a particular statute, regulation or program requirement, requests advice from a Government
agency (including a Medicare DMERC) charged with administering a Federal health care
program, the DMEPOS supplier should document and retain a record of the request and any
written or oral response, including the identity and position of the individual providing
the response. DMEPOS suppliers should take the same steps when requesting advice from
private payors. This step is extremely important if the DMEPOS supplier intends to rely on
that response to guide it in future decisions, actions, or claim reimbursement requests or
appeals. A log of oral inquiries between the DMEPOS supplier and third parties will help
the organization document its attempts at compliance. In addition, the DMEPOS supplier
should maintain records relevant to the issue of whether its reliance was
&quot;reasonable&quot; and whether it exercised due diligence in developing procedures and
practices to implement the advice. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, conduct audits to
ensure compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations and policies. The OIG
recognizes that the small DMEPOS supplier may not have the resources to audit its
operations to the extent suggested previously in this section. At a minimum, the OIG
recommends that the small DMEPOS supplier conduct an internal audit. The DMEPOS supplier
may choose to review a random sample of claims based on the risk areas it identified. We
recommend that the DMEPOS supplier conduct an initial baseline audit and periodically
conduct follow-up audits. If problems were identified in the baseline audit, the DMEPOS
supplier may want to re-audit the same issue, at a later date, in order to measure the
effectiveness of any corrective action(s) implemented as a result of the DMEPOS supplier's
compliance program. The DMEPOS supplier should document the results of all audits it
conducts. The DMEPOS supplier may want to use the OIG's Audit Process handbook to help
design the audit.<a href="#N_169_"><sup>(169)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The extent of a DMEPOS supplier's audit should depend on the DMEPOS supplier's
identified risk areas and resources. If the DMEPOS supplier comes under Government
scrutiny in the future, the Government will assess whether or not the DMEPOS supplier
developed a comprehensive audit based upon identified risk areas and resources. If the
Government determines that the DMEPOS supplier failed to develop an adequate audit
program, given its resources, the Government will be less likely to afford the DMEPOS
supplier favorable treatment under its various enforcement authorities. </p>

<p><strong>F. <u>ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Discipline Policy and Actions</strong> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for corporate officers, managers, independent agents and other DMEPOS supplier employees
who have failed to comply with the DMEPOS supplier's standards of conduct, policies and
procedures, Federal and State statutes, rules, and regulations or Federal, State or
private payor health care program requirements. It should also address disciplinary
actions for those who have engaged in wrongdoing, which has the potential to impair the
DMEPOS supplier's status as a reliable, honest, and trustworthy health care provider. </p>

<p>The OIG believes that the compliance program should include a written policy statement
setting forth the degrees of disciplinary actions that may be imposed upon corporate
officers, managers, independent agents and other DMEPOS supplier employees for failing to
comply with the DMEPOS supplier's standards, policies, and applicable statutes and
regulations. Intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject transgressors to
significant sanctions. Such sanctions could include oral warnings, suspension,
termination, or other sanctions, as appropriate. Each situation must be considered on a
case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate sanction. The written standards of conduct
should elaborate on the procedures for handling disciplinary problems and specify those
who will be responsible for taking appropriate action. Some disciplinary actions can be
handled by managers, while others may have to be resolved by the owner(s), president or
CEO. Disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible employee's failure to
detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence or reckless conduct. Personnel
should be advised by the DMEPOS supplier that disciplinary action will be taken on a fair
and equitable basis. Managers and supervisors should be made aware that they have a
responsibility to discipline employees in an appropriate and consistent manner. </p>

<p>It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of disciplinary standards for improper
conduct and to educate corporate officers, managers, and other DMEPOS supplier employees
regarding these standards. The consequences of noncompliance should be consistently
applied and enforced, in order for the disciplinary policy to have the required deterrent
effect. All levels of employees should be subject to the same types of disciplinary action
for the commission of similar offenses. The commitment to compliance applies to all
personnel levels within a DMEPOS supplier. The OIG believes that corporate officers,
managers, and supervisors should be held accountable for failing to comply with, or for
the foreseeable failure of their subordinates to adhere to, the applicable standards,
statutes, rules, regulations and procedures. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should consistently apply
the consequences of non-compliance. The OIG recognizes that small DMEPOS suppliers may not
have a written document detailing the disciplinary actions for non-compliance. However,
all employees should be clearly informed of such consequences. </p>

<p><strong>2. New Employee Policy</strong> </p>

<p>For all new employees who have discretionary authority to make decisions that may
involve compliance with the law or compliance oversight, DMEPOS suppliers should conduct a
reasonable and prudent background investigation, including a reference check,<a
href="#N_170_"><sup>(170)</sup></a> as part of every such employment application. The
application should specifically require the applicant to disclose any criminal conviction,
as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(i), or exclusion action. Pursuant to the compliance
program, the DMEPOS supplier's policies should prohibit the employment of individuals who
have been recently convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are
listed as debarred, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health
care programs (as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(f)).<a href="#N_171_"><sup>(171)</sup></a>
In addition, pending the resolution of any criminal charges or proposed debarment or
exclusion, the OIG recommends that such employees should be removed from direct
responsibility for, or involvement with, the DMEPOS supplier's business operations related
to any Federal health care program. In addition, we recommend that the DMEPOS supplier
remove such employee from any position(s) for which the employee's salary or the items or
services rendered by the employee are paid in whole or part, directly or indirectly, by
Federal health care programs or otherwise with Federal funds.<a href="#N_172_"><sup>(172)</sup></a>
If resolution of the matter results in conviction, debarment, or exclusion, then the
DMEPOS supplier should remove the individual from direct responsibility for or involvement
with all Federal health care programs. Similarly, if an independent contractor or a
referring physician or other authorized person is debarred or excluded from participation
in Federal health care programs, and the DMEPOS supplier is aware of it, the DMEPOS
supplier should not involve that individual/entity in the Federal health care portion of
its business. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should ensure that they do
not employ or contract with anyone who has been debarred, excluded or is otherwise
ineligible to participate in Federal health care programs. </p>

<p><strong>G. <u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES AND DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION
INITIATIVES</u></strong> </p>

<p><strong>1. Violations and Investigations</strong> </p>

<p>Violations of a DMEPOS supplier's compliance program, failures to comply with
applicable Federal or State statutes, rules, regulations or Federal, State or private
payor health care program requirements, and other types of misconduct threaten a DMEPOS
supplier's status as a reliable, honest and trustworthy health care provider. Detected but
uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the mission, reputation, and legal status of
the DMEPOS supplier. Consequently, upon reports or reasonable indications of suspected
noncompliance, it is important that the compliance officer or other management officials
immediately investigate the conduct in question to determine whether a material violation
of applicable law, rules or program instructions or the requirements of the compliance
program has occurred, and if so, take decisive steps to correct the problem.<a
href="#N_173_"><sup>(173)</sup></a> As appropriate, such steps may include an immediate
referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities, a corrective action plan,<a
href="#N_174_"><sup>(174)</sup></a> a report to the Government,<a href="#N_175_"><sup>(175)</sup></a>
and the return of any overpayments, if applicable. </p>

<p>Where potential fraud or False Claims Act liability is not involved, the OIG recommends
that the DMEPOS supplier promptly return any overpayments to the affected payor as they
are discovered. However, even if the overpayment detection and return process is working
and is being monitored by the DMEPOS supplier, the OIG still believes that the compliance
officer needs to be made aware of these overpayments, violations, or deviations that may
reveal trends or patterns indicative of a systemic problem. </p>

<p>Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations, an internal investigation will
probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents, such as submitted claims
and CMNs. The DMEPOS supplier should consider engaging outside auditors or health care
experts to assist in an investigation. Records of the investigation should contain
documentation of the alleged violation, a description of the investigative process
(including the objectivity of the investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of
interview notes and key documents, a log of the witnesses interviewed, the documents
reviewed, and the results of the investigation (<u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken
and any corrective action implemented). Although any action taken as the result of an
investigation will necessarily vary depending upon the DMEPOS supplier and the situation,
DMEPOS suppliers should strive for some consistency by utilizing sound practices and
disciplinary protocols.<a href="#N_176_"><sup>(176)</sup></a> Further, after a reasonable
period, the compliance officer should review the circumstances that formed the basis for
the investigation to determine whether similar problems have been uncovered or
modifications of the compliance program are necessary to prevent and detect other
inappropriate conduct or violations. </p>

<p>If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer
believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of
employees under investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work
activity until the investigation is completed (unless an internal or Government-led
undercover operation known to the DMEPOS supplier is in effect). In addition, the
compliance officer should take appropriate steps to secure or prevent the destruction of
documents or other evidence relevant to the investigation. If the DMEPOS supplier
determines disciplinary action is warranted, it should be prompt and imposed in accordance
with the DMEPOS supplier's written standards of disciplinary action. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should ensure that they are
responsive to investigating allegations of potential misconduct. </p>

<p><strong>2. Reporting</strong> </p>

<p>If the compliance officer, compliance committee or other management official discovers
credible evidence of misconduct from any source and, after a reasonable inquiry, has
reason to believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil, or administrative law,
then the DMEPOS supplier should promptly report the existence of misconduct to the
appropriate Federal and State authorities<a href="#N_177_"><sup>(177)</sup></a> within a
reasonable period, but not more than sixty (60) days<a href="#N_178_"><sup>(178)</sup></a>
after determining that there is credible evidence of a violation.<a href="#N_179_"><sup>(179)</sup></a>
Prompt reporting will demonstrate the DMEPOS supplier's good faith and willingness to work
with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem. In addition, reporting
such conduct will be considered a mitigating factor by the OIG in determining
administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments, and exclusion), if the
reporting provider becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_180_"><sup>(180)</sup></a>
<br>
<br>
When reporting misconduct to the Government, a DMEPOS supplier should provide all evidence
relevant to the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State law(s) and potential cost
impact. The compliance officer, with advice of counsel, and with guidance from the
governmental authorities, could be requested to continue to investigate the reported
violation. Once the investigation is completed, the compliance officer should be required
to notify the appropriate governmental authority of the outcome of the investigation,
including a description of the impact of the alleged violation on the operation of the
applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries. If the investigation ultimately
reveals that criminal, civil, or administrative violations have occurred, the appropriate
Federal and State authorities<a href="#N_181_"><sup>(181)</sup></a> should be notified
immediately. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should ensure that they are
reporting the results of any overpayments or violations to the appropriate entity. </p>

<p><strong>3. Corrective Actions</strong> </p>

<p>As previously stated, the DMEPOS supplier should take appropriate corrective action,
including prompt identification of any overpayment to the affected payor and the
imposition of proper disciplinary action. If potential fraud or violations of the False
Claims Act are involved, any repayment of the overpayment should be made as part of the
discussion with the Government following a report of the matter to law enforcement
authorities. Otherwise, the overpayment should be promptly refunded to the affected payor.
The OIG recommends that the overpayment refund include the information as outlined in
section II.E. Failure to disclose overpayments within a reasonable period of time could be
interpreted as an intentional or knowing attempt to conceal the overpayment from the
Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal or civil violation
with respect to the DMEPOS supplier, as well as any individuals who may have been
involved. For this reason, DMEPOS supplier compliance programs should emphasize that
overpayments obtained from Medicare or other Federal health care programs should be
promptly disclosed and returned to the payor that made the erroneous payment. </p>

<p>The OIG believes all DMEPOS suppliers, regardless of size, should take appropriate
corrective action to remedy the identified deficiency. </p>

<p><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation to the process
necessary to develop an effective and cost-efficient DMEPOS supplier compliance program.
As previously stated, however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and
resources of an individual DMEPOS supplier, depending upon its size; number of locations;
type of equipment provided; or corporate structure. The Federal and State health care
statutes, rules, and regulations and Federal, State and private payor health care program
requirements, should be integrated into every DMEPOS supplier's compliance program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches
millions of beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly
evolving. In particular, legislation has been passed that creates additional Medicare
program participation requirements, such as requiring DMEPOS suppliers to purchase surety
bonds and expanding the Medicare supplier standards.<a href="#N_182_"><sup>(182)</sup></a>
As stated throughout this guidance, compliance is a dynamic process that helps to ensure
that DMEPOS suppliers and other health care providers are better able to fulfill their
commitment to ethical behavior, as well as meet the changes and challenges being imposed
upon them by Congress and private insurers. Ultimately, it is OIG's hope that a
voluntarily created compliance program will enable DMEPOS suppliers to meet their goals,
improve the quality of service to patients, and substantially reduce fraud, waste, and
abuse, as well as the cost of health care, to Federal, State and private health insurers. <a

<p>§ 1395x(s)(9). <a name="N_5_"></a></p>

<p>5. The term &quot;supplies&quot; includes home dialysis supplies and equipment as
described in 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s)(2)(f); surgical dressings and other devices as
described in 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s)(5); immunosuppressive drugs as described in 42 U.S.C.
§ 1395x(s)(2)(J); and any other items or services designated by the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA). <a name="N_6_"></a></p>

<p>6. The OIG recognizes that not every supplier provides durable medical equipment,
prosthetics, orthotics and supplies. However, a compliance program incorporating the
elements in this guidance can be used by all suppliers regardless of the items/services
they provide. <a name="N_7_"></a></p>

<p>7. Recent case law suggests that the failure of a corporate Director to attempt in
good faith to institute a compliance program in certain situations may be a breach of a
Director's fiduciary obligation. <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In re Caremark International Inc.
Derivative Litigation</u>, 698 A.2d 959 (Ct. Chanc. Del. 1996). <a name="N_8_"></a></p>

<p>8. The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an <u>effective</u>
compliance program that pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the
appropriateness of administrative sanctions. However, the burden is on the DMEPOS supplier
to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of a compliance program. Further, the False
Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, provides that a person who has violated the Act, but
who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government within 30 days of detection, in
certain circumstances will be subject to not less than double, as opposed to treble,
damages. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a). Thus, the ability to react quickly when
violations of the law are discovered may materially help reduce a DMEPOS supplier's
liability. <a name="N_9_"></a></p>

<p>9. This is particularly true in the context of DMEPOS suppliers, which include many
small independent DMEPOS suppliers with limited financial resources, staff, and product
lines as well as large DMEPOS supplier chains with extensive financial resources, staff,
and product lines. <a name="N_10_"></a></p>

<p>15. Corporate integrity agreements are executed as part of a civil settlement
between a health care provider and the Government to resolve a case based on allegations
of health care fraud or abuse. These OIG-imposed programs are in effect for a period of
three to five years and require many of the elements included in this compliance program
guidance. <a name="N_16_"></a></p>

<p>16. A formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of directors,
owner(s) or president, where applicable. A formal commitment should include the allocation
of adequate resources to ensure that each of the elements is addressed. <a name="N_17_"></a></p>

<p>17. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>,
8A1.2, Application Note 3(k). The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and
practices for the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe the appropriate sanctions
for offenders convicted of Federal crimes. <a name="N_18_"></a></p>

<p>18. In some instances, persons other than the treating physician (<u>e.g.</u>,
nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist) may be authorized to
order DMEPOS for Medicare beneficiaries if permitted under State law and in accordance
with HCFA policies. A DMEPOS supplier should be aware of any persons, other than the
treating physician, who are authorized to order DMEPOS. <a name="N_19_"></a></p>

<p>19. The integral functions of the compliance officer and the corporate compliance
committee in implementing an effective compliance program are discussed throughout this
compliance program guidance. However, the OIG recognizes that the differences in the sizes
and structures of DMEPOS suppliers will result in differences in the ways in which
compliance programs are set up. It is important that a DMEPOS supplier structures its
compliance program in such a way that the program facilitates implementation of the key
functions of the corporate compliance officer and the corporate compliance committee
discussed within this document. <u>See</u>section II.B and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_20_"></a></p>

<p>20. Education and training programs for DMEPOS suppliers should be detailed and
comprehensive. They should cover specific billing procedures, sales and marketing
practices, as well as the general areas of compliance. <u>See</u> section II.C and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_21_"></a></p>

<p>21. For example, spot-checking the work of coding and billing personnel
periodically and conducting periodic post-payment claim reviews should be elements of an
effective compliance program. <u>See</u> section II.E and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_22_"></a></p>

<p>22. The term &quot;Federal health care programs&quot; is applied in this document
as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(f), and includes any plan or program that provides
health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded
directly, in whole or in part, by the United States Government (<u>i.e.</u>, via programs
such as Medicare, Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Black Lung, or the Longshore and
Harbor Worker's Compensation Act) or any State health plan (<u>e.g.</u>, Medicaid, or a
program receiving funds from block grants for social services or child health services).
Also, for the purposes of this document, the term &quot;Federal health care program
requirements&quot; refers to the statutes, regulations, rules, requirements, directives,
and instructions governing Medicare, Medicaid, and all other Federal health care programs.
<a name="N_23_"></a></p>

<p>23. According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization must have
established compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other
agents in order to receive sentencing credit for an &quot;effective&quot; compliance
program. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines define &quot;agent&quot; as &quot;any
individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an independent contractor,
authorized to act on behalf of the organization.&quot; <u>See</u> United States Sentencing
Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(d). <a
name="N_24_"></a></p>

<p>24. The OIG strongly encourages high-level involvement by a DMEPOS supplier's
owner(s), governing body, CEO, president, vice president(s), as well as other personnel,
as appropriate, in the development of the standards of conduct. Such involvement should
help communicate a strong and explicit organizational commitment to compliance goals and
standards. <a name="N_25_"></a></p>

<p>25. <u>E.g.</u>, pharmacies, billing services, and manufacturers. <a name="N_26_"></a></p>

<p>26. The OIG recognizes that not all statutes, rules, regulations, standards,
policies, and procedures need to be communicated to all employees. However, the OIG
believes that the bulk of the standards that relate to complying with fraud and abuse laws
and other ethical areas should be addressed and made part of all affected employees'
training. A DMEPOS supplier must decide whether additional educational programs should be
targeted to specific categories of employees based on job functions and areas of
responsibility. <a name="N_27_"></a></p>

<p>27. A DMEPOS supplier can conduct focus groups, composed of managers from various
departments, to solicit their concerns and ideas about compliance risks that may be
incorporated into the DMEPOS supplier's policies and procedures. Such employee
participation in the development of the DMEPOS supplier's compliance program can enhance
its credibility and foster employee acceptance of the program. <a name="N_28_"></a></p>

<p>28. A DMEPOS supplier's compliance program should require that the legal staff,
compliance officer, or other appropriate personnel carefully consider any and all Special
Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions issued by the OIG that relate to DMEPOS suppliers. <u>See</u>
note 12. Moreover, the compliance program should address the ramifications of failing to
cease and correct any conduct criticized in such a Special Fraud Alert or Advisory
Opinion, if applicable to the DMEPOS supplier, or to take reasonable action to prevent
such conduct from reoccurring in the future. If appropriate, a DMEPOS supplier should take
the steps described in section II.G regarding investigations, reporting, and correction of
identified problems. <a name="N_29_"></a></p>

<p>29. The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG currently intends to
address in the fiscal year. It should be noted that the priorities in the Work Plan are
subject to modification and revision as the year progresses and does not represent a
complete or final list of areas of concern to the OIG. The Work Plan is currently
available on the Internet at: <em>http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig</em>. <a name="N_30_"></a></p>

<p>30. Billing for items or services not provided involves submitting a claim
representing that the DMEPOS supplier provided an item or service or part of an item or
service that the patient did not receive. It may also include not fulfilling a contractual
agreement, for example, when the DMEPOS supplier has agreed to service the rental
equipment and does not fulfill this obligation. <a name="N_31_"></a></p>

<p>31. Billing for services that may be denied involves seeking reimbursement for a
service that is not covered by Medicare or does not meet the Medicare coverage criteria as
documented by the patient's current medical condition. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. §
1395y(a)(1)(A). The OIG recognizes that DMEPOS suppliers cannot make medical necessity
determinations and may not be aware if an item or service will be denied in every
instance. However, civil monetary penalties and administrative sanctions may be imposed
against any person who submits a claim for services &quot;that [the] person knows or
should know are not medically necessary.&quot; <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a(a). Such
conduct may also result in liability under civil and criminal laws. </p>

<p>HCFA does allow DMEPOS suppliers to submit claims when the DMEPOS supplier believes the
item or service may not be covered, provided, however, that the supplier &quot;note[s] on
the claim [its] belief that the service is noncovered and that it is being submitted at
the beneficiary's insistence.&quot; <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 3043. If the
DMEPOS supplier believes the item or service may be denied for any reason (<u>e.g.</u>,
not covered, not medically necessary), the DMEPOS supplier may have the beneficiary sign a
written notice accepting financial responsibility if the item or service is denied (<u>see</u>
Medicare Carriers Manual </p>

<p>§ 7300.5). The DMEPOS supplier should include modifier &quot;GA&quot; on the claim for
such item or service. This modifier indicates the beneficiary has signed a written notice.
If the beneficiary signed an advance written notice, the DMEPOS supplier may directly bill
the beneficiary for the denied item or service. (<u>See</u> section II.A.3.i for further
discussion on written notices). <u>See also </u>discussion in section II.A.3.a and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_32_"></a></p>

<p>32. This includes, but is not limited to, billing the patient for items or services
denied as not medically necessary by the payor, where there has been no written notice
signed by the patient, the written notice has been inappropriately obtained or the written
notice was drafted inappropriately. <u>See</u> Medicare Carrier Manual § 7300.5A,
regarding the requirements for written notice. <a name="N_33_"></a></p>

<p>33 Duplicate billing occurs when more than one claim for payment is submitted for
the same patient, for the same service, for the same date of service (by the same or
different DMEPOS supplier), or the same claim is submitted to more than one payor as
primary. Although duplicate billing can occur due to simple error (which does not create
civil or criminal liability), fraudulent duplicate billing is often evidenced by
systematic or repeated double billing, and creates liability under criminal, civil, and
administrative law, particularly if any overpayment is not promptly refunded. <u>See</u>
note 72. <a name="N_34_"></a></p>

<p>34. Billing for items or services not ordered involves seeking reimbursement for
items or services provided, but not ordered by the treating physician or other authorized
person. <a name="N_35_"></a></p>

<p>35. If a billing agent receives payment on behalf of a DMEPOS supplier, the billing
agent's compensation may not be related in any way to the dollar amounts billed or
collected. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395u(b)(6); 42 C.F.R. § 424.73; Medicare Carriers
Manual § 3060. <a name="N_36_"></a></p>

<p>36. Upcoding involves selecting a code to maximize reimbursement when such code is
not the most appropriate descriptor of the service (<u>e.g.</u>, billing for a more
expensive piece of equipment when a less expensive piece of equipment is provided). <a
name="N_37_"></a></p>

<p>37. Unbundling items or supplies involves billing for individual components when a
specific HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code provides for the components to
be billed as a unit (<u>e.g.</u>, providing a wheelchair and billing the individual parts
of the wheelchair, rather than the wheelchair as a whole). <a name="N_38_"></a></p>

<p>38. The DMEPOS supplier must indicate on the Medicare claim form, through the use
of modifiers, whether the item provided is new or used. The modifier for providing new
equipment is &quot;NU.&quot; The modifier for providing used equipment is &quot;UE.&quot;
A knowing failure to correctly document the item provided would constitute falsifying
information on the claim form and may constitute a violation of the False Claims Act. <u>See</u>
31 U.S.C. § 3729. <a name="N_39_"></a></p>

<p>39. Once a rental item is no longer medically necessary, the DMEPOS supplier is
required to discontinue billing the payor for it. The OIG recognizes that DMEPOS suppliers
cannot make medical necessity determinations and may not be aware that a rental item is no
longer medically necessary for a particular patient. As a result, the OIG recommends that
the DMEPOS supplier periodically contact the treating physician or other authorized person
to ensure the rental item continues to be medically necessary. In addition, the OIG
recommends that the DMEPOS supplier pick up such equipment from the patient in a timely
manner. If the DMEPOS supplier bills for a rental item after it is no longer medically
necessary, the DMEPOS supplier is financially responsible for that item and must remit any
overpayments for that item. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)(3), which provides
criminal penalties for failure to disclose an overpayment. <a name="N_40_"></a></p>

<p>40. This practice involves the DMEPOS supplier improperly changing information on a
previously denied claim and continuing to resubmit the claim in an attempt to receive
payment. For example, a DMEPOS supplier may submit a claim using the accurate HCPCS code
for the item or service provided and the claim is subsequently denied. It is improper to
change the HCPCS code to a HCPCS code that the DMEPOS supplier believes is reimbursable,
when such item or service was not provided. <a name="N_41_"></a></p>

<p>41. This practice involves a DMEPOS supplier not submitting a claim on behalf of
the beneficiary for items or services that are Medicare benefits and are reimbursable
under the Medicare program. <u>See</u><strong> </strong>42 U.S.C § 1395w-4(g)(4). <a
name="N_42_"></a></p>

<p>42. The OIG recommends that the DMEPOS supplier create internal mechanisms to
ensure that the use of contractors does not lead to improper billing practices. <a
name="N_43_"></a></p>

<p>43. A DMEPOS supplier should ensure that its billing personnel are informed of the
different payment rules of all the Federal, State, and private health care programs it
bills. The supplier should be aware that billing for items or services furnished
substantially in excess of the supplier's usual charges may result in exclusion and other
sanctions. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(6)(A). <u>See also</u> OIG Ad. Op. 98-8
(1998). <a name="N_44_"></a></p>

<p>44. This practice, which constitutes overutilization, involves providing and/or
billing for substantially more items or supplies than are reasonable and necessary for the
needs of each individual patient. The OIG recognizes that DMEPOS suppliers cannot make
medical necessity determinations. The medical need for an item must be determined by the
physician or other authorized person who is treating the patient. However, the DMEPOS
supplier must ensure that the patient's condition meets coverage, payment and utilization
criteria as established in the payor's medical policies. If the DMEPOS supplier is
providing and/or billing for substantially excessive amounts of DMEPOS items or supplies,
the DMEPOS supplier is financially responsible for remitting any overpayments relating to
those items or supplies. The OIG recommends that if a DMEPOS supplier is providing and
billing for a large number of items or supplies for the same patient, it may periodically
want to contact the treating physician or other authorized person to confirm the medical
necessity of the items or supplies. Such contact with the physician's office should be
documented. The practice of billing for substantially excessive amounts of items or
supplies may lead to exclusion from Federal health care programs and other sanctions. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(6)(B). <a name="N_45_"></a></p>

<p>45. This practice involves providing and/or billing for an item or service that
does not meet the definition and/or requirement of the item or service ordered by the
treating physician or other authorized person. Generally, such items are inferior in
quality, and therefore do not meet the definition of what was ordered and/or billed.
Sometimes this may mean that certain equipment was never cleared by the Food and Drug
Administration, as required by law. This practice may lead to billing for items that are
not reasonable and necessary. A DMEPOS supplier should ensure that the items or services
it furnishes meet professionally recognized minimum standards of health care. <a
name="N_46_"></a></p>

<p>46. <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.3.k and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_47_"></a></p>

<p>47. In order for a patient to continue to receive items or supplies (<u>e.g.</u>,
rental equipment, supplies for an on-going condition) and for the DMEPOS supplier to
receive Medicare reimbursement, the patient must meet the medical necessity criteria for
that specific item or supply on an on-going basis. The item or supply furnished by the
DMEPOS supplier should be replaced or adjusted, in a timely manner, to reflect changes in
the patient's condition. The OIG recognizes that a DMEPOS supplier cannot make medical
necessity determinations and may not be aware when a patient's condition changes. However,
if a DMEPOS supplier is billing for items or services that are no longer medically
necessary, the supplier is financially responsible for remitting any overpayments relating
to those items or services. The OIG recommends that if a DMEPOS supplier is providing the
same items or supplies to a patient on a regular basis, it may periodically want to
contact the treating physician or other authorized person to confirm that the items or
supplies continue to be medically necessary. Such contact with the physician's office
should be documented. <a name="N_48_"></a></p>

<p>48. This practice involves a DMEPOS supplier delivering to the patient, and/or
billing the payor for, items or supplies that have not yet been ordered by the treating
physician or other authorized person. Medicare requires written orders for certain items
before delivery. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 42 C.F.R. § 410.38. <a name="N_49_"></a></p>

<p>49. This practice involves supplying false information to be included on the claim
form, the CMN, or other accompanying documentation. The information reported on these
documents should accurately reflect the patient's information, including medical
information, and the items or services ordered by the treating physician or other
authorized person and provided by the DMEPOS supplier. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 18 U.S.C. §
1035, which provides criminal penalties for falsifying information on such documentation. <a
name="N_50_"></a></p>

<p>50. This practice involves not completing the CMN in compliance with Medicare
regulations (<u>i.e.</u>, sections B and D should never be completed by the supplier).
Instructions for completing the CMN can be found on the back of the form. <u>See</u>
Medicare Carriers Manual § 3312, which provides instructions on how to complete the CMN
and the civil monetary penalties (CMPs) that may be assessed for improper completion of
the CMN. <u>See also</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(j)(2); section II.A.3.c and accompanying notes
for further discussion on CMNs. Such conduct may also result in liability under civil and
criminal laws. <a name="N_51_"></a></p>

<p>51. This practice involves falsifying information on a patient's medical records to
justify reimbursement for an item or service. <a name="N_52_"></a></p>

<p>52. This practice involves altering the treating physician's or other authorized
person's diagnosis in an attempt to receive reimbursement for a particular item or
service. A DMEPOS supplier should not claim the patient has a particular medical condition
in order to qualify for an item for which the patient would not otherwise qualify. <a
name="N_53_"></a></p>

<p>53. This practice involves failing to ensure that the medical necessity
documentation requirements for the item or service billed are properly met (<u>e.g.</u>,
failing to maintain the physician orders or CMNs or failing to ensure that CMNs contain
adequate and correct information). <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 4105.2 for
evidence of medical necessity. <u>See also</u> sections II.A.3.b and II.A.3.c regarding
physician orders and CMNs, respectively. <a name="N_54_"></a></p>

<p>54. This practice involves indicating on the claim form that the place of service
is a location other than where the service was provided. For example, the patient resides
in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and a DMEPOS supplier submits a claim with the place
of service as the patient's home. Provided that the DMEPOS items or services are ordered,
provided, reasonable and necessary given the clinical condition of the patient, the items
or services may be covered if the beneficiary resides at home. However, such items may not
be covered if the beneficiary resides in a SNF. <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual §
2100.3 for the definition of a beneficiary's home. <a name="N_55_"></a></p>

<p>55. <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.3.m. <a name="N_56_"></a></p>

<p>56. This practice involves the improper use of the ZX modifier, relating to
maintaining medical necessity documentation. <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.3.l. <a
name="N_57_"></a></p>

<p>57. Throughout this document, the term &quot;deductibles and coinsurance&quot;
refers to Medicare as well as to any other health insurance program requiring deductibles
and coinsurance. <u>See</u>discussion in section II.A.3.j and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_58_"></a></p>

<p>58. Examples of arrangements that may run afoul of the anti-kickback statute
include practices in which a DMEPOS supplier pays a fee to a physician for each CMN the
physician signs, provides free gifts to physicians for signing CMNs, provides inducements
to beneficiaries, and/or provides items or services for free or below fair market value to
providers or beneficiaries of Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. §
1320a-7a(a)(5); 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b); 60 Fed. Reg. 40,847 (August 10, 1995). <u>See
also</u> discussion in section II.A.4 and accompanying notes. <a name="N_59_"></a></p>

<p>59. Compensation programs that offer incentives for items or services ordered or
the revenue they generate may lead to the ordering of medically unnecessary items or
supplies and/or the &quot;dumping&quot; of such items or supplies in a facility or in a
beneficiary's home (<u>e.g.</u>, mail order supply companies that continue to send the
patient supplies when the supplies are no longer medically necessary).<strong> </strong><a
name="N_60_"></a></p>

<p>60. Equally troubling to the OIG is the proliferation of business arrangements that
may violate the anti-kickback statute or other similar Federal and State statute or
regulation. Such arrangements are generally established between those in a position to
refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services, such as DMEPOS
suppliers, for which a Federal health care program pays. Sometimes established as
&quot;joint ventures,&quot; these arrangements may take a variety of forms. The OIG
currently has a number of investigations and audits underway that focus on such areas of
concern. The OIG has also issued a Special Fraud Alert on Joint Venture Arrangements. This
Special Fraud Alert can be found at 59 Fed. Reg. 65,372 (December 19, 1994) or on the
Internet at: http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a name="N_61_"></a></p>

<p>61. Under the Stark physician self-referral law, if a physician (or an immediate
family member of such physician) has a prohibited financial relationship with a DMEPOS
supplier, the physician may not make a referral to the DMEPOS supplier and the DMEPOS
supplier may not bill for furnishing DMEPOS items or supplies for which payment may be
made under the Federal health care programs. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn. <a
name="N_62_"></a></p>

<p>62. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(a)(17) or Pub.L. 103-432 § 132(a) for the
prohibition on telemarketing. <u>See also</u> discussion in section II.A.5<strong> </strong>and
accompanying notes. <a name="N_63_"></a></p>

<p>63. The DMEPOS supplier should not utilize prohibited or inappropriate conduct to
carry out its initiatives and activities designed to maximize business growth and patient
retention. Many cases against DMEPOS suppliers have involved the DMEPOS supplier giving
the beneficiary free gifts such as angora underwear, microwaves and air conditioners in
exchange for providing and billing for unnecessary items. Any marketing information
offered by the DMEPOS supplier should be clear, correct, non-deceptive, and fully
informative. <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.5 and accompanying notes. <a
name="N_64_"></a></p>

<p>64. In this situation, a physician allows a DMEPOS supplier to stock inventory (the
storage space may or may not be rented by the DMEPOS supplier) in a physician's office.
When such items and supplies are dispensed to the patient, Medicare is then billed.
Although such arrangements are not prohibited per se, the OIG believes that such
arrangements may potentially raise anti-kickback and self-referral issues, particularly
when the DMEPOS supplier pays the physician an amount above fair market value to rent the
space. <a name="N_65_"></a></p>

<p>65. A DMEPOS supplier should have appropriate personnel acknowledge they have
reviewed and will abide by the Medicare supplier standards. In addition, a DMEPOS supplier
should ensure it is meeting individual State and private payor supplier standards. <u>See</u>
42 C.F.R. § 424.57 for the Medicare supplier standards. <a name="N_66_"></a></p>

<p>66. Criminal penalties may be imposed against an individual who knowingly and
willfully makes or causes to be made any false statements or representations of a material
fact in any application for any benefit or payment under a Federal health care program. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)(1). <u>See also</u> 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) (&quot;any person who. .
. knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get
a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government. . . is liable to the
United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than
$10,000, plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the
act of that person. . .&quot;) <a name="N_67_"></a></p>

<p>67. By signing the DMEPOS supplier enrollment application, a DMEPOS supplier
certifies it will notify the Medicare contractor of any changes in its enrollment
information within 30 days of the effective date of the change. <a name="N_68_"></a></p>

<p>68. It is unlawful for a DMEPOS supplier to represent itself as a Medicare
representative. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320b-10. <a name="N_69_"></a></p>

<p>69. This practice may involve, but is not limited to, using another DMEPOS
supplier's billing number.<strong> </strong><a name="N_70_"></a></p>

<p>70. A DMEPOS supplier should be aware of the requirements of any payor they bill,
especially in those situations where there is a primary and secondary payor. <a
name="N_71_"></a></p>

<p>71. <u>E.g.</u>, Medicare does not permit DMEPOS suppliers to perform oxygen tests
(<u>e.g.</u>, oximetry tests and arterial blood gas tests) to qualify patients for oxygen
and oxygen supplies. <u>See</u>Medicare Coverage Issues Manual § 60-4. <u>See also</u>
discussion in section II.A.3.o. <a name="N_72_"></a></p>

<p>72. An overpayment is the amount of money received in excess of the amount due and
payable under a health care program. Examples of overpayments include, but are not limited
to, instances where a DMEPOS supplier is: (i) paid twice for the same service, for the
same beneficiary; or (ii) paid for services that were provided but not ordered by the
treating physician or other authorized person. The OIG strongly recommends that the DMEPOS
supplier institute procedures to detect overpayments and to promptly remit such
overpayments to the affected payor. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)(3). <u>See also</u>
18 U.S.C. § 669 and 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(7). <a name="N_73_"></a></p>

<p>73. If a patient is also due money when a DMEPOS supplier identifies an overpayment
to a health care program, the DMEPOS supplier should make a prompt refund to the patient. <u>See</u>
42 U.S.C. § 1395m(j)(4) on limitation of patient liability for non-assigned claims that
are denied due to medical necessity. <u>See also</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395pp(h) on limitation
of patient liability for assigned claims that are denied due to medical necessity. <a
name="N_74_"></a></p>

<p>74. A lack of communication between the DMEPOS supplier, physician, and patient may
result in the DMEPOS supplier inappropriately billing for items or supplies (<u>e.g.</u>,
supplies for an on-going condition or rental equipment that are no longer medically
necessary). <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.3.n. <a name="N_75_"></a></p>

<p>75. A lack of communication between the different departments of a DMEPOS supplier
may result in the DMEPOS supplier filing incorrect claims and/or equipment delivery
problems. <a name="N_76_"></a></p>

<p>76. This involves hiring or contracting with individuals or entities who have been
excluded from participation in Federal health care programs or any other Federal
procurement or non-procurement program<strong>. </strong><u>See</u> section II.F.2. <a
name="N_77_"></a></p>

<p>77. &quot;Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an organization has
previously committed casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable steps to prevent such
misconduct&quot; and is a significant factor in the assessment of whether a compliance
program is effective. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines
Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(k)(iii). <a name="N_78_"></a></p>

<p>78. <u>See</u> note 31. <a name="N_79_"></a></p>

<p>79. <u>See</u> Medicare Carrier Manual § 3312. <u>See also</u> Medicare Carrier
Manual § 4105.2 regarding what information must be included on the physician's order. <a
name="N_80_"></a></p>

<p>80. An original CMN is that in which Section B was completed by the treating
physician or other authorized person and contains the original signature of the treating
physician or other authorized person. <a name="N_81_"></a></p>

<p>81. In order to ensure correct reimbursement, the payor may conduct a post-payment
audit of a DMEPOS supplier's claims. Such audits may require that the DMEPOS supplier
submit documentation to substantiate that the items or services were ordered by the
treating physician or other authorized person, provided, covered, reasonable and
necessary.<strong> </strong><u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 424.5(a)(6).<strong> </strong><a
name="N_82_"></a></p>

<p>86. Items or services requiring CMNs are as follows: Home oxygen therapy (HCFA form
484); Hospital beds (HCFA form 841); Support surfaces (HCFA form 842); Motorized
wheelchairs (HCFA form 843) (Section C continuation, HCFA form 854); Manual wheelchairs
(HCFA form 844) (Section C continuation, HCFA form 854); Continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) devices (HCFA form 845); Lymphedema pumps (pneumatic compression devices)
(HCFA form 846); Osteogenesis stimulators (HCFA form 847); Transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulators (TENS) (HCFA form 848); Seat lift mechanisms (HCFA form 849); Power operated
vehicles (HCFA form 850); Infusion pumps (HCFA form 851); Parenteral nutrition (HCFA form
852); and Enteral nutrition (HCFA form 853). <a name="N_87_"></a></p>

<p>87. <u>See</u> HCFA Program Memorandum<strong> </strong>B-99-23 (April 1999). <a
name="N_88_"></a></p>

<p>88. A supplier who knowingly and willfully completes section B of the form is, at a
minimum, subject to a civil money penalty of up to $1,000 for each form or document
completed in such manner. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(j)(2). That supplier may also face
civil and criminal liability. <a name="N_89_"></a></p>

<p>89. <u>See</u> HCFA Program Memorandum B-98-47 (November, 1998), which discusses
who is authorized to sign section D of the CMN. <a name="N_90_"></a></p>

<p>90. A supplier who knowingly and willfully fails to include, in section C, the fee
schedule amount and the supplier's charge for the equipment or supplies being furnished
may be subject to a civil money penalty up to $1,000 for each form or document so
distributed. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(j)(2). <a name="N_91_"></a></p>

<p>91. Physicians or persons authorized to sign section D (<u>see</u> note 89), should
only sign CMNs in which sections A-C are completed and correct. Signature and date stamps
are not acceptable. <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 3312. <a name="N_92_"></a></p>

<p>92. There have been many investigations centering on DMEPOS suppliers who alter
information in order to affect their reimbursement (<u>e.g.</u>, altering diagnosis code,
altering HCPCS code of service provided). <a name="N_93_"></a></p>

<p>93. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(a)(11)(B). <u>See also</u> 42 C.F.R. § 410.38. <a

<p>95. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. § 3729, which provides for the imposition of penalties of
$5,000 to $10,000 per false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages suffered
by the Federal Government because of the false claim. <a name="N_96_"></a></p>

<p>96. The phone number for the SADMERC's HCPCS coding help line is 803-736-6809. The
hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, EST. Based on the
information provided by the DMEPOS supplier, the SADMERC will aid the DMEPOS supplier in
choosing the most accurate code for the item or service ordered and supplied. However, the
DMEPOS supplier should be aware that assigning a HCPCS code to an item or service does not
necessarily guarantee reimbursement. <a name="N_97_"></a></p>

<p>97. By signing the certification statement on the enrollment application, the
applicant agrees that he/she has read, understood, meets and will continue to meet the
supplier standards and will be disenrolled from the program if any standards are not met
or violated. <a name="N_98_"></a></p>

<p>98. <u>E.g.</u>, if a DMEPOS supplier has more than one location, the supplier
number of the location that filled the physician's or other authorized person's order will
be used on the claim form. <a name="N_99_"></a></p>

<p>109. <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 5520. <a name="N_110_"></a></p>

<p>110. What constitutes &quot;financial need&quot; varies depending on the
circumstances. However, the OIG believes it is important that a DMEPOS supplier make
determinations of financial need on an individualized, case by case, basis in accordance
with a reasonable set of income guidelines uniformly applied in all cases. The guidelines
should be based on objective criteria and appropriate for the applicable locality. It is
not appropriate to apply inflated income guidelines that result in waivers of copayments
for persons not in genuine financial need. <a name="N_111_"></a></p>

<p>111. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 413.80; Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part I §§
308, 310. <a name="N_112_"></a></p>

<p>112. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 414.229(d). <a name="N_113_"></a></p>

<p>113. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 414.229(e). <a name="N_114_"></a></p>

<p>114. DMEPOS suppliers must offer beneficiaries the option of purchasing
power-driven wheelchairs at the time the DMEPOS supplier first furnishes the item. <u>See</u>
42 C.F.R. § 414.229(d)(1). <a name="N_115_"></a></p>

<p>115. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 414.229(e). <a name="N_116_"></a></p>

<p>117. <u>See</u> Medicare Carriers Manual § 4105.3. <a name="N_118_"></a></p>

<p>118. <u>See</u> relevant DMERC supplier manual(s) for guidelines on proper use. <a
name="N_119_"></a></p>

<p>119. Encouraging physicians or other authorized persons to order unwanted items or
supplies may result in submitting claims for items or services that are not reasonable or
necessary. The OIG is aware of instances where the DMEPOS supplier has copied the CMN,
completed section B of the copy, and used this completed copy as its cover letter to
physicians. <a name="N_120_"></a></p>

<p>120. <u>See</u> Coverage Issues Manual § 60-4. <a name="N_121_"></a></p>

<p>121. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 414.226. <a name="N_122_"></a></p>

<p>122. Towards this end, the DMEPOS supplier should, among other things, obtain
copies of all relevant OIG regulations, Special Fraud Alerts, and Advisory Opinions (these
documents are located on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig), and ensure that
the DMEPOS supplier's policies reflect the guidance provided by the OIG. <u>See</u> 42
U.S.C. § 1395nn(a) for the Stark physician referral laws. <u>See also</u> 42 U.S.C. §
1320a-7b for prohibited activities under the anti-kickback statute. <a name="N_123_"></a></p>

<p>123. If the DMEPOS supplier questions an arrangement into which it may enter, it
should consider asking the OIG for an Advisory Opinion regarding the anti-kickback statute
or HCFA for an Advisory Opinion regarding Stark. <u>See</u> 62 Fed. Reg. 7350 (February
19, 1997) and 63 Fed. Reg. 38,311 (July 16, 1998) for instructions on how to submit an
Advisory Opinion to the OIG. These instructions are also located on the Internet at
http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 1645 (January 9, 1998) on how to
submit an Advisory Opinion to HCFA. <a name="N_124_"></a></p>

<p>124. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a(a)(5), which provides for civil monetary
penalties for improper inducements to beneficiaries. <a name="N_125_"></a></p>

<p>125. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952. Simply because an arrangement does not meet
a safe harbor does not necessarily mean it is illegal. <a name="N_126_"></a></p>

<p>126. <u>See</u> anti-kickback statute discussion in section II.A.4. <a
name="N_127_"></a></p>

<p>127. <u>See</u> discussion in section II.A.3.j. <a name="N_128_"></a></p>

<p>128. <u>See, e.g.</u>, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b); OIG Ad. Op. 98-10 (1998); section
II.A.4. <a name="N_129_"></a></p>

<p>129. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1395m(a)(17), Pub.L. 103-432 §132(a). <a
name="N_130_"></a></p>

<p>130. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. § 1320b-10. <a name="N_131_"></a></p>

<p>131. This records system should be tailored to fit the individual needs and
financial resources of the DMEPOS supplier. <a name="N_132_"></a></p>

<p>132. The creation and retention of such documents and reports may raise a variety
of legal issues, such as patient privacy and confidentiality. These issues are best
discussed with legal counsel. <a name="N_133_"></a></p>

<p>133. This should include notifications regarding inappropriate claims and
overpayments. <a name="N_134_"></a></p>

<p>134. <u>E.g.</u>, companies should not choose a sales manager who may be pressured
to achieve high sales, which might result in a conflict with compliance goals. <a
name="N_135_"></a></p>

<p>135. The OIG believes that it is not advisable for the compliance function to be
subordinate to the DMEPOS supplier's general counsel, comptroller or similar DMEPOS
supplier financial officer. Free standing compliance functions help to ensure independent
and objective legal reviews and financial analyses of the institution's compliance efforts
and activities. By separating the compliance function from the key management positions of
general counsel or chief financial officer (where the size and structure of the DMEPOS
supplier make this a feasible option), a system of checks and balances is established to
more effectively achieve the goals of the compliance program. <a name="N_136_"></a></p>

<p>136. For DMEPOS supplier chains, the OIG encourages coordination with each DMEPOS
supplier location through the use of a headquarter's compliance officer, communicating
with parallel positions in each facility or regional office, as appropriate. <a
name="N_137_"></a></p>

<p>137. The List of Excluded Individuals/Entities is an OIG-produced report available
on the Internet at http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. It is updated on a regular basis to
reflect the status of individuals and entities who have been excluded from participation
in all Federal health care programs (individuals/entities excluded before August 5, 1997
were only excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, Title V and Title XX
programs). The DMEPOS supplier can download the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and
the subsequent monthly exclusion and reinstatement supplements or can use the online
search feature. <a name="N_138_"></a></p>

<p>138. The List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement
programs is a GSA-produced report available on the Internet at http://epls.arnet.gov/. <a
name="N_139_"></a></p>

<p>139. The OIG recognizes that it may be burdensome for DMEPOS suppliers to check
these lists for referring physicians. However, a DMEPOS supplier should be aware that if
it submits a claim in which an excluded physician provided the referral, Medicare will
deny payment. <a name="N_140_"></a></p>

<p>140. Periodic on-site visits of DMEPOS supplier operations, bulletins with
compliance updates and reminders, distribution of audiotapes or videotapes on different
risk areas, lectures at management and employee meetings, circulation of recent health
care articles covering fraud and abuse, and innovative changes to compliance training are
various examples of approaches and techniques the compliance officer can employ for the
purpose of ensuring continued interest in the compliance program and the DMEPOS supplier's
commitment to its policies and principles. <a name="N_141_"></a></p>

<p>141. The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals
with varying responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, billing, coding,
marketing, and human resources, as well as employees and managers of key operating units.
These individuals should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive experience within
their respective departments to implement any necessary changes to the DMEPOS supplier's
policies and procedures as recommended by the committee. A compliance committee for a
DMEPOS supplier that is part of another organization (<u>e.g.</u>, home health agency)
might benefit from the participation of officials from other departments in the
organization, such as the accounting and billing departments. <a name="N_142_"></a></p>

<p>142. A DMEPOS supplier should expect its compliance committee members and
compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness, and an
approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the DMEPOS
supplier. The DMEPOS supplier's compliance committee members should also have significant
professional experience working with billing, documentation, and auditing principles. <a
name="N_143_"></a></p>

<p>143. This includes, but is not limited to, the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
§§ 3729-3733; the criminal false claims statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 287, 1001; the fraud
and abuse provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33; the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-191; and compliance with
the Medicare supplier standards, 42 C.F.R. § 424.57. <a name="N_144_"></a></p>

<p>144. With respect to national DMEPOS supplier chains, this may include fostering
coordination and communication between those employees responsible for compliance at
headquarters and those responsible for compliance at the individual supplier branches. <a
name="N_145_"></a></p>

<p>145. OIG publications such as Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection reports,
and Advisory Opinions, as well as the annual OIG Work Plan, are readily available from the
OIG and could be the basis for standards, educational courses and programs. <a
name="N_146_"></a></p>

<p>146. Significant variations in functions and responsibilities of different
departments may create the need for training materials that are tailored to the compliance
concerns associated with particular operations and duties. <a name="N_147_"></a></p>

<p>147. Certain positions, such as those involving developing and submitting claims,
as well as sales and marketing, create a greater organizational legal exposure, and
therefore require specialized training. The DMEPOS supplier should fill such positions
with individuals who have the appropriate educational background, training, experience,
and credentials. <a name="N_148_"></a></p>

<p>148. Where the DMEPOS supplier has a culturally diverse employee base, the
standards of conduct should be translated into other languages and written at appropriate
reading levels. <a name="N_149_"></a></p>

<p>149. The OIG recognizes that not all standards, policies and procedures need to be
communicated to all employees. However, the OIG believes that the bulk of the standards
that relate to complying with fraud and abuse laws and other ethical areas should be
addressed and made part of all employees' training. A DMEPOS supplier should determine the
additional training to provide categories of employees based upon their job
responsibilities. <a name="N_150_"></a></p>

<p>150. Government, in this context, includes the appropriate Medicare DMERC(s). <a
name="N_151_"></a></p>

<p>151. In addition, where feasible, the OIG recommends that a DMEPOS supplier afford
outside contractors and its physician clients the opportunity to participate in the DMEPOS
supplier's compliance training and educational programs, or develop their own programs
that complement the DMEPOS supplier's standards of conduct, compliance requirements and
other rules and practices. <a name="N_152_"></a></p>

<p>152. Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of corporate integrity
agreements that require many of these training elements. The OIG usually requires a
minimum of one to three hours annually for basic training in compliance areas. Additional
training is required for specialty fields such as billing, coding, sales and marketing. <a
name="N_153_"></a></p>

<p>153. Appropriate coding and billing depends upon the quality and completeness of
documentation. Therefore, the OIG believes that the DMEPOS supplier must foster an
environment where interactive communication is encouraged. <a name="N_154_"></a></p>

<p>154. Post training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and
employee comprehension of the DMEPOS supplier's policies and procedures. <a name="N_155_"></a></p>

<p>155. <u>See</u> note 96. <a name="N_156_"></a></p>

<p>156. The OIG believes that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation,
a concept embodied in the provisions of the False Claims Act. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. §
3730(h). In many cases, employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u>
<u>tam</u> provisions out of frustration because of the company's failure to take action
when a questionable, fraudulent, or abusive situation was brought to the attention of
senior corporate officials. <a name="N_157_"></a></p>

<p>157. The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a small DMEPOS
supplier to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls solely on compliance
issues. These companies may want to explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>, outsourcing
the hotline or establishing a written method of confidential disclosure. <a name="N_158_"></a></p>

<p>158. In addition to methods of communication used by current employees, an
effective employee exit interview program could be designed to solicit information from
departing employees regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations of DMEPOS
supplier policies and procedures. <a name="N_159_"></a></p>

<p>159. DMEPOS suppliers should also post in a prominent, available area the HHS-OIG
Hotline telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800-HHS-TIPS), in addition to any company
hotline number that may be posted. <a name="N_160_"></a></p>

<p>160. To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, a DMEPOS supplier
should create an intake form for all compliance issues identified through reporting
mechanisms. The form could include information concerning the date that the potential
problem was reported, the internal investigative methods utilized, the results of the
investigation, any corrective action implemented, any disciplinary measures imposed, and
any overpayments returned. <a name="N_161_"></a></p>

<p>161. Information obtained over the hotline may provide valuable insight into
management practices and operations, whether reported problems are actual or perceived. <a
name="N_162_"></a></p>

<p>162. Even when a DMEPOS supplier is owned by a larger corporate entity, the regular
auditing and monitoring of the compliance activities of an individual DMEPOS supplier
location must be a key feature in any annual review. Appropriate reports on audit findings
should be periodically provided and explained to a parent organization's senior staff and
officers. <a name="N_163_"></a></p>

<p>163. <u>See also</u> section II.A.2. <a name="N_164_"></a></p>

<p>164. The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a DMEPOS
supplier, the compliance officer, with the assistance of department managers, should take
a &quot;snapshot&quot; of operations from a compliance perspective. This assessment can be
undertaken by outside consultants, law or accounting firms, or internal staff, with
authoritative knowledge of health care compliance requirements. This &quot;snapshot,&quot;
often used as part of benchmarking analyses, becomes a baseline for the compliance officer
and other managers to judge the DMEPOS supplier's progress in reducing or eliminating
potential areas of vulnerability. <a name="N_165_"></a></p>

<p>165. In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section II.G.2, below, reports
of fraud or systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate governmental
authority. <a name="N_166_"></a></p>

<p>166. One way to assess the knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of a DMEPOS
supplier's employees is through the use of a validated survey instrument (<u>e.g.</u>,
employee questionnaires, interviews, or focus groups). <a name="N_167_"></a></p>

<p>167. Such records should include, but not be limited to, logs of hotline calls,
logs of training attendees, training agenda and materials, and summaries of corrective
action and improvements with respect to DMEPOS supplier policies as a result of compliance
activities. <a name="N_168_"></a></p>

<p>168. The OIG recognizes that DMEPOS suppliers that are small in size and have
limited resources may not be able to use internal reviewers who are not part of line
management or hire outside reviewers. <a name="N_169_"></a></p>

<p>169. The Audit Process handbook can be downloaded from the OIG Office of Audit
Services' webpage at http://www.hhs.gov/progorg/oas. <a name="N_170_"></a></p>

<p>170. <u>See</u> notes 137 and 138. Since the employees of DMEPOS suppliers have
access to potentially vulnerable people and their property, DMEPOS suppliers should also
strictly scrutinize whether they should employ individuals who have been convicted of
crimes of neglect, violence or financial misconduct. <a name="N_171_"></a></p>

<p>171. Likewise, DMEPOS supplier compliance programs should establish standards
prohibiting the execution of contracts with companies that have been recently convicted of
a criminal offense related to health care or that are listed by a Federal agency as
debarred, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care
programs. <u>See</u> notes 137 and 138. <a name="N_172_"></a></p>

<p>172. Prospective employees who have been officially reinstated into the Medicare
and Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof of such
reinstatement. <a name="N_173_"></a></p>

<p>173. Instances of non-compliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
existence, or amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely
determinative of whether or not the conduct should be investigated and reported to
governmental authorities. In fact, there may be instances where there is no readily
identifiable monetary loss at all, but corrective action and reporting are still necessary
to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries. <a name="N_174_"></a></p>

<p>174. Advice from the DMEPOS supplier's in-house counsel or an outside law firm may
be sought to determine the extent of the DMEPOS supplier's liability and to plan the
appropriate course of action. <a name="N_175_"></a></p>

<p>175. The OIG currently maintains a provider self-disclosure protocol that
encourages providers to report suspected fraud. The concept of voluntary self-disclosure
is premised on a recognition that the Government alone cannot protect the integrity of the
Medicare and other Federal health care programs. Health care providers must be willing to
police themselves, correct underlying problems, and work with the Government to resolve
these matters. The self-disclosure protocol is located on the OIG's website at
http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig. <a name="N_176_"></a></p>

<p>176. The parameters of a claim review subject to an internal investigation will
depend on the circumstances surrounding the issue(s) identified. By limiting the scope of
an internal audit to current billing, a DMEPOS supplier may fail to identify major
problems and deficiencies in operations, as well as be subject to certain liability. <a
name="N_177_"></a></p>

<p>177. Appropriate Federal and State authorities include the Office of Inspector
General, Department of Health and Human Services; the Criminal and Civil Divisions of the
Department of Justice; the U.S. Attorney in the relevant district(s); and the other
investigative arms for the agencies administering the affected Federal or State health
care programs, such as: the State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service; the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Office of Inspector
General, U.S. Department of Labor (which has primary criminal jurisdiction over FECA,
Black Lung and Longshore programs); and the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (which has primary jurisdiction over the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program). <a name="N_178_"></a></p>

<p>178. In contrast, to qualify for the &quot;not less than double damages&quot;
provision of the False Claims Act, the report must be provided to the Government within
thirty (30) days after the date when the DMEPOS supplier first obtained the information. <u>See</u>
31 U.S.C. § 3729(a). <a name="N_179_"></a></p>

<p>179. The OIG believes that some violations may be so serious that they warrant
immediate notification to governmental authorities, prior to, or simultaneous with,
commencing an internal investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, if the conduct: (1) is a clear
violation of criminal law; (2) has a significant adverse effect on the quality of care
provided to program beneficiaries (in addition to any other legal obligations regarding
quality of care); or (3) indicates evidence of a systemic failure to comply with
applicable laws, rules or program instructions or an existing corporate integrity
agreement, regardless of the financial impact on Federal health care programs. <a
name="N_180_"></a></p>

<p>180. The OIG has published criteria setting forth those factors that the OIG takes
into consideration in determining whether it is appropriate to exclude a health care
provider from program participation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(7) for violations
of various fraud and abuse laws. <u>See</u> 62 Fed. Reg. 67,392 (December 24, 1997). <a
name="N_181_"></a></p>

<p>181. <u>See</u> note 177. <a name="N_182_"></a></p>
