<strong>AGENCY:</strong>  Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS.<br>
<strong>ACTION:</strong>  Notice.<br>
<strong>SUMMARY:</strong>  This <u>Federal Register</u> notice sets forth the recently issued Compliance Program
Guidance for Nursing Facilities developed by the Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The OIG
has previously developed and published compliance program guidance focused on several other
areas and aspects of the health care industry.  We believe that the development and issuance of
this compliance program guidance for nursing facilities will continue to serve as a positive step
toward promoting a higher level of ethical and lawful conduct throughout the entire health care
industry.

Inspector General, (202) 619-2078.

<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong>

<p><strong>Background</strong> 

<p>   The creation of compliance program guidances is a major initiative of the OIG in its effort to
engage the private health care community in combating fraud and abuse.  In the last several
years, the OIG has developed and issued compliance program guidances directed at the following
segments of the health care industry:  the hospital industry; home health agencies; clinical
laboratories; third-party medical billing companies; the durable medical equipment, prosthetics,
orthotics and supply industry; hospices; and Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated
care plans.  The development of these types of compliance program guidances is based on our
belief that a health care provider can use internal controls to more efficiently monitor adherence
to applicable statutes, regulations and program requirements.

<p>   Copies of these compliance program guidances can be found on the OIG web site at
http://www.hhs.gov/oig.

<p><strong>Developing Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities</strong>

<p>   On December 18, 1998, the OIG published a solicitation notice seeking information and
recommendations for developing formal guidance for nursing facilities (63 FR 70137).  In
response to that solicitation notice, the OIG received 16 comments from various outside sources. 
We carefully considered those comments, as well as previous OIG publications, such as other
compliance program guidances and Special Fraud Alerts, in developing a compliance program
guidance for nursing facilities.  In addition, we have taken into account past and recent fraud
investigations conducted by the OIG's Office of Investigations and the Department of Justice,
and have consulted with the Health Care Financing Administration.  In an effort to ensure that all
parties had a reasonable opportunity to provide input into a final product, the draft guidance for
nursing facilities was published in the <u>Federal Register</u> on October 29, 1999 (64 FR 58419) for
further comments and recommendations.  

<p><strong>Elements for an Effective Compliance Program</strong>

<p>   This compliance guidance for nursing facilities contains seven elements that the OIG has
determined to be fundamental to an effective compliance program:

<ul>
  <li>   	implementing written policies, procedures and standards of conduct;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	designating a compliance officer and compliance committee;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	conducting effective training and education;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	developing effective lines of communication;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	enforcing standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	conducting internal monitoring and auditing; and</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>   	responding promptly to detected offenses and developing corrective action.</li>
</ul>

<p>   These elements are contained in previous guidances issued by the OIG.  As with previously-issued guidances, this compliance program guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how
nursing facilities can best establish internal controls and prevent fraudulent activities.  The
contents of this guidance should not be viewed as mandatory or as an exclusive discussion of the
advisable elements of a compliance program; the document is intended to present voluntary
guidance to the industry and not represent binding standards for nursing facilities.

<p><strong>Office of Inspector General's Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities </strong> 

<br><br>
<strong>I.  INTRODUCTION</strong>

<p>   The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) continues in its efforts to promote voluntarily implemented compliance programs for the
health care industry.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  This compliance guidance is intended to assist nursing facilities<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> develop
and implement internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to applicable statutes and
regulations of the Federal health care programs<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and private insurance program requirements. 
Compliance programs strengthen Government efforts to prevent and reduce fraud and abuse, as
well as further the mission of all nursing facilities to provide quality care to their residents.

<p>   Through this document, the OIG provides its views on the fundamental elements of nursing
facility compliance programs, as well as the principles that each nursing facility should consider
when developing and implementing an effective compliance program.  While this document
presents basic procedural and structural guidance for designing a compliance program, it is not in
and of itself a compliance program.  Rather, it is a set of guidelines that nursing facilities should
consider when developing and implementing a compliance program.  For those nursing facilities
that have an existing program or are already in the process of implementing a compliance
program, these guidelines may serve as a benchmark against which to measure their ongoing
efforts.      

<p>   Implementing an effective compliance program in a nursing facility may require a significant
commitment of time and resources by all parts of the organization.  However, superficial efforts
or programs that are hastily constructed and implemented without a long term commitment to a
culture of compliance likely will be ineffective and may expose the nursing facility to greater
liability than if it had no program at all.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  Although an effective compliance program may require
a reallocation of existing resources, the long term benefits of establishing a compliance program
significantly outweigh the initial costs.  In short, compliance measures are an investment that
advance the goals of the nursing facility, the solvency of the Federal health care programs, and
the quality of care provided to the nursing home resident.

<p>   In a continuing effort to collaborate closely with health care providers and the private sector,
the OIG placed a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> soliciting comments and recommendations on
what should be included in this compliance program guidance.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  In addition to considering these
comments in drafting this guidance, we reviewed previous OIG publications, including OIG
Special Fraud Alerts and OIG Medicare Advisory Bulletins, as well as reports issued by OIG's
Office of Audit Services (OAS) and Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI) affecting the
nursing home industry.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>  In addition, we relied on the experience gained from fraud
investigations of nursing home operators conducted by OIG's Office of Investigations, the
Department of Justice, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Units.

<p><strong>A.  <u>Benefits of a Compliance Program</u></strong>

<p>   The OIG believes a comprehensive compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the
public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse, enhancing
operational functions, improving the quality of health care services, and decreasing the cost of
health care.  Attaining these goals provides positive results to the nursing facility, the
Government, and individual citizens alike.  In addition to fulfilling its legal duty to ensure that it
is not submitting false or inaccurate claims to Government and private payors, a nursing facility
may gain numerous other benefits by voluntarily implementing a compliance program.  The
benefits may include:

<ul>
  <li>	the formulation of effective internal controls to ensure compliance with statutes,
regulations and rules;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	a concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the nursing
facility's commitment to responsible corporate conduct;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	the ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	an increased likelihood of identifying and preventing unlawful and unethical
behavior;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	the ability to quickly react to employees' operational compliance concerns and
effectively target resources to address those concerns;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	an improvement in the quality, efficiency, and consistency of providing services;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	a mechanism to encourage employees to report potential problems and allow for
appropriate internal inquiry and corrective action; </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	a centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes,
regulations and other program directives;<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	a mechanism to improve internal communications;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	procedures that allow prompt and thorough investigation of alleged misconduct;
and</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	through early detection and reporting, minimizing loss to the Government from
false claims, and thereby reducing the nursing facility's exposure to civil damages
and penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> </li>
</ul>

<p>   The OIG recognizes that the implementation of a compliance program may not entirely
eliminate fraud and abuse from the operations of a nursing facility.  However, a sincere effort by
the nursing facility to comply with applicable statutes and regulations as well as Government and
private payer health care program requirements, through the establishment of a compliance
program, significantly reduces the risk of unlawful or improper conduct.

<p><strong>B.  <u>Application of Compliance Program Guidance</u></strong>

<p>   Given the diversity within the long term care industry, there is no single "best" nursing facility
compliance program.  The OIG recognizes the complexities of this industry and is sensitive to
the differences among large national chains, regional multi-facility operators, and small
independent homes.  However, the elements of this guidance can be used by all nursing facilities
to establish a compliance program, regardless of size (in terms of employees and gross revenues),
number of locations, or corporate structure.  Similarly, a corporation that provides long term care
as part of an integrated health care delivery system may incorporate these elements into its
structure.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>  

<p>   We recognize that some nursing facilities may not be able to adopt certain elements to the same
degree as others with more extensive resources.  At the end of several sections of this document,
the OIG has offered suggestions to assist these smaller nursing facility providers in implementing
the principles expressed in this guidance.  Regardless of size, structure or available resources, the
OIG recommends that every nursing facility should strive to accomplish the objectives and
principles underlying all of the compliance polices and procedures in this guidance. 

<p>   By no means should the contents of this guidance be viewed as an exclusive or complete
discussion of the advisable elements of a compliance program.  On the contrary, the OIG strongly
encourages nursing facilities to develop and implement compliance elements that uniquely
address the areas of potential problems, common concerns, or high risk areas that apply to their
own facilities.  Furthermore, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more information
and knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes occur in the statutes, regulations and rules
of the Federal health care programs and private health plans.  New compliance practices also may be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG discovers
enhancements that promote effective compliance.

<p><strong>II.  COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong>

<p><strong>A.  <u>The Seven Basic Compliance Elements</u></strong>

<p>   The OIG believes that every effective compliance program must begin with a formal
commitment<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> by the nursing facility's governing body to address <u>all</u> of the applicable elements
listed below, which are based on the seven steps of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  The
OIG recognizes that full implementation of all elements may not be immediately feasible for all
nursing facilities.  However, as a first step, a good faith and meaningful commitment on the part
of nursing facility management will substantially contribute to the program's successful
implementation.  As the compliance program is effectuated, that commitment should cascade
down through management to every employee and contractor of the nursing facility.

<p>   At a minimum, a comprehensive compliance program should include the following seven 
elements:

<p>   (1)  The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as written
policies, procedures and protocols that promote the nursing facility's commitment to compliance
(<u>e.g.</u>, including adherence to the compliance program as an element in evaluating managers and
employees) and address specific areas of potential fraud and abuse, such as claims development
and submission processes, quality of care issues, and financial arrangements with physicians and
outside contractors;

<p>   (2)  The designation of a compliance officer and other appropriate bodies (<u>e.g.</u>, a corporate
compliance committee) charged with the responsibility for developing, operating and monitoring
the compliance program, and who reports directly to the owner(s), governing body and/or CEO;<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

<p>   (3)  The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training programs
for all affected employees;<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

<p>   (4)  The creation and maintenance of an effective line of communication between the
compliance officer and all employees, including a process, such as a hotline or other reporting
system, to receive complaints, and the adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of
complainants and to protect whistle blowers from retaliation;

<br><br>
   (5)  The use of audits and/or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance, identify
problem areas, and assist in the reduction of identified problems;<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

<p>   (6)  The development of policies and procedures addressing the non-employment or retention
of excluded individuals or entities and the enforcement of appropriate disciplinary action against
employees or contractors who have violated corporate or compliance policies and procedures,
applicable statutes, regulations, or Federal, State, or private payor health care program
requirements; and	       

<p>   (7)  The development of policies and procedures with respect to the investigation of identified
systemic problems, which include direction regarding the prompt and proper response to detected
offenses, such as the initiation of appropriate corrective action, repayments, and preventive
measures.

<p><strong>B.  <u>Written Policies and Procedures</u></strong>

<p>   Every compliance program should develop and distribute written compliance standards,
procedures, and practices that guide the nursing facility and the conduct of its employees
throughout day-to-day operations.  These policies and procedures should be developed under the
direction and supervision of the compliance officer, the compliance committee, and operational
managers.  At a minimum, they should be provided to all employees who are affected by these
policies, as well as physicians, suppliers, nursing facility agents, and contractors, as applicable to
those entities.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  In addition to general corporate policies and procedures, an effective compliance
program should include specific policies and procedures for the different clinical, financial, and
administrative functions of a nursing facility.

<p><strong>1.  Code of Conduct</strong>

<p>   While a clear statement of policies and procedures is at the core of a compliance program, the
OIG recommends that nursing facilities start the process with the development of a corporate
statement of principles that will guide the operations of the provider.  One common expression of
this statement of principles is the code of conduct.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>  The code should function in the same
fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a foundational document that details the fundamental principles,
values, and framework for action within an organization.  The code of conduct for a nursing
facility should articulate the organization's expectations of employees, as well as summarize the
basic legal principles under which the organization must operate.  Unlike the more detailed
policies and procedures, the code of conduct should be brief, easily readable and cover general
principles applicable to all employees.  

<p>   The code of conduct should be distributed to, and comprehensible by, all affected employees.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> 
Depending on the facility's work force, this may mean that the code should be translated into
other languages when necessary and written at appropriate reading levels.  Further, any employee
handbook delineating the standards of conduct should be regularly updated to reflect
developments in applicable Government and private health care program requirements.  Finally,
the OIG recommends that current employees, as well as those newly hired, should certify that
they have received, read, and will abide by the organization's code of conduct.  These
certifications, updated any time the code is revised or amended by the organization, should be
retained in the employee's personnel file and made available for review.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> 

<p>   The OIG believes that <u>all</u> nursing facilities should operate under the guidance of a code of
conduct.  While the OIG recognizes that some nursing facilities may not have the resources to
establish a comprehensive compliance program, we believe that every nursing facility can design
a program that addresses the seven elements set out in this guidance, albeit at different levels of
sophistication and complexity.  In its most fundamental form, a facility's code of conduct is a
basic set of standards that articulate the organization's philosophy, summarize basic legal
principles, and teach employees how to respond to practices that may violate the code of conduct. 
These standards should be posted and distributed to every employee.  Further, even a small nursing facility should obtain written attestation from its employees to confirm their
understanding and commitment to the nursing facility's code of conduct.  

<p><strong>2.  Specific Risk Areas</strong>

<p>   As part of their commitment to a compliance program, nursing facilities should prepare a
comprehensive set of written policies and procedures that are in place to prevent fraud and abuse
in facility operations and to ensure the appropriate care of their residents.  These policies and
procedures should educate and alert all affected managers and employees of the Federal health
care program and private payor requirements, the consequences of noncompliance, and the
specific procedures that nursing facility employees should follow to report problems, to ensure
compliance, and to rectify any prior noncompliance. 

<p>   The OIG recognizes that many States require nursing facilities to have a policies and
procedures manual and that most facilities have in place procedures to prevent fraud and abuse in
their institutions.  These providers may not need to develop a new, comprehensive set of policies
as part of their compliance program if existing policies effectively encompass the provider's
operations and relevant rules.  However, the nursing home industry is subject to numerous
Federal and State statutes, rules, regulations and manual instructions.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  Because these program
requirements are frequently modified, the OIG recommends that all nursing facilities evaluate
their current compliance policies and procedures by conducting a baseline assessment of risk
areas, as well as subsequent reevaluations.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>  The OIG also recommends that these internal
compliance reviews be undertaken on a regular basis to ensure compliance with current program
requirements. 

<p>   To assist nursing facilities in performing this internal assessment, the OIG has developed a list
of potential risk areas affecting nursing facility providers.  These risk areas include quality of
care and residents' rights, employee screening, vendor relationships, billing and cost reporting,
and record keeping and documentation.  This list of risk areas is not exhaustive, nor all
encompassing.  Rather, it should be viewed as a starting point for an internal review of potential
vulnerabilities within the nursing facility.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  The objective of this assessment should be to ensure
that the employees, managers and directors are aware of these risk areas and that steps are taken
to minimize, to the extent possible, the types of problems identified.  While there are many ways
to accomplish this objective, comprehensive written policies and procedures that are
communicated to all appropriate employees and contractors are the first step in an effective
compliance program.  

<p>   The OIG believes that sound operating compliance policies are essential to all nursing
facilities, regardless of size and capability.  If a lack of resources to develop such policies is
genuinely an issue, the OIG recommends that those nursing facilities focus first on those risk
areas most likely to arise in their business operations.  At a <u>minimum</u>, resources should be
directed to analyze the results of annual surveys,<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> and to verify that the facility has effectively
addressed any deficiencies cited by the surveyors.  An effective and low-cost means to
accomplish this is through the use of the facility's Quality Assessment and Assurance
Committee.  The committee should consist of facility staff members, including the Director of
Nursing and the medical director.  Inclusion and participation of direct care staff (<u>e.g.</u>, nurses and
nurses' aides who provide direct resident care) should be encouraged.  This committee is best
suited to establish measurable, outcome-based criteria that focus on vulnerabilities that adversely
affect the care of residents.  On a periodic basis, the committee should meet to identify issues
affecting the quality of care provided to the residents and to develop and implement appropriate
corrective actions.  The time commitment required for this collaborative effort will vary
according to the magnitude of the facility's quality assessment and assurance issues.  

<p>   Creating a resource manual from publicly available information may be a cost-effective
approach for developing policies and procedures to improve the quality of each resident's life. 
For example, a simple binder that contains a facility's written policies and procedures, the most
recent survey findings and plan of correction, relevant HCFA instructions and bulletins, and
summaries of key OIG documents (<u>e.g</u>., Special Fraud Alerts, Advisory Bulletins, inspection and
audit reports) can be regularly updated and made accessible to all employees.  Particularly in the
case of more technical materials, it may be advisable to provide summaries in the handbook and
make the source documents available upon request.  If individualized copies of this handbook
are not made available to all employees, then a reference copy should be available in a readily
accessible location, as well as from the designated compliance officer.

<p><strong>a.  Quality of Care</strong>

<p>   The OIG believes that a nursing facility's compliance policies should start with a statement that
affirms the facility's commitment to providing the care and services necessary to attain or
maintain the resident's "highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  To
achieve the goal of providing quality care, nursing facilities should continually measure their
performance against comprehensive standards that, at a minimum, must include Medicare
requirements.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>  In addition to these regulations, a facility should develop its own quality of care
protocols and implement mechanisms for evaluating compliance with those protocols.  As part of
its ongoing commitment to quality care, the facility should implement a system that reviews each
resident's outcomes and improves on those outcomes through analysis and modification of the
delivery of care.  After the care delivery protocols have been modified, the facility should re-analyze the residents' outcomes to assure that the modification had the desired result and has
actually improved care.  Although resident care protocols are a useful tool for maintaining or
improving the quality of care, facilities should ensure that measurable resident outcomes are used
to determine the adequacy of the care actually rendered.  

<p>   As noted above, current and past surveys are a good place to begin to identify specific risk
areas and regulatory vulnerabilities at the individual facility.  Any deficiencies discovered by an
annual State agency survey, Federal validation survey or complaint survey reflect noncompliance
with the program requirements for nursing homes and can be the basis for enforcement actions.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> 
Those deficiencies identified by the State agency survey instrument must be addressed and,
where appropriate, the corrective action should be incorporated into the facility's policies and
procedures as well as reflected in its training and educational programs.  In addition to
responding promptly to deficiencies identified through the survey and certification process,
nursing facilities should take proactive measures to identify, anticipate, and respond to quality of
care risk areas identified by the nursing home ombudsman or other sources.

<p>   As noted throughout this guidance, each provider must assess its vulnerability to particular
abusive practices in light of its unique circumstances.  However, the OIG, HCFA, the
Department of Justice, and State enforcement agencies have substantial experience in identifying
quality of care risk areas.  Some of the special areas of concern include:

<ul>
  <li>	absence of a comprehensive, accurate assessment of each resident's functional
capacity and a comprehensive care plan that includes measurable objectives and
timetables to meet the resident's medical, nursing, and mental and psychosocial
needs;<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		inappropriate or insufficient treatment and services to address residents' clinical
conditions, including pressure ulcers, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence of
the bladder, and mental or psychosocial problems;<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to accommodate individual resident needs and preferences;<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to properly prescribe, administer and monitor prescription drug usage;<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		inadequate staffing levels or insufficiently trained or supervised staff to provide
medical, nursing, and related services;<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> 
  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to provide appropriate therapy services;<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to provide appropriate services to assist residents with activities of daily
living (e.g., feeding, dressing, bathing, etc.);</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to provide an ongoing activities program to meet the individual needs of all
residents; and</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		failure to report incidents of mistreatment, neglect, or abuse to the administrator
of the facility and other officials as required by law.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(<u>32)</u></sup></a>
  </li></ul>

<p>   As noted previously, a nursing facility that has a history of serious deficiencies should use
those survey results as a starting point for implementing a comprehensive plan to improve its
quality of care.  The quality of life for nursing home residents can be improved most directly by
effectively addressing these risk areas with written policies and procedures, which are then
implemented through effective training programs and supervision.

<p><strong>b.  Residents' Rights</strong>
	

<p>   The Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, Public Law 100-203, established a number of
requirements to protect and promote the rights of each resident.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  In addition, many States have
adopted specific lists of residents' rights.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  The nursing facility's policies should address the
residents' right to a dignified existence that promotes freedom of choice, self-determination, and
reasonable accommodation of individual needs.  To protect the rights of each resident, the OIG
recommends that a provider address the following risk areas as part of its compliance policies:

<ul>
  <li>	discriminatory admission or improper denial of access to care;<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul> <li>	verbal, mental or physical abuse, corporal punishment and involuntary seclusion;<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints;<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	failure to ensure that residents have personal privacy and access to their personal
records upon request and that the privacy and confidentiality of those records are
protected;<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	denial of a resident's right to participate in care and treatment decisions; <a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>and</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	failure to safeguard residents' financial affairs.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c.  Billing and Cost Reporting</strong>

<p>   Abusive and fraudulent billing practices in the Federal health care programs drain the public
fisc of the funds needed to provide program beneficiaries medically necessary items and services. 
These types of abusive practices also have had an adverse financial impact on private health
insurance plans and their subscribers.  Over the last twenty years, the OIG has identified patterns
of improper and fraudulent activities that cover the spectrum of health care services and have
cost taxpayers billions of dollars.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  These fraudulent billing practices, as well as abuses in other
risk areas that are described in this compliance program guidance, have resulted in criminal, civil
and administrative enforcement actions.  Because the consequences of these enforcement actions
can have a profound adverse impact on a provider, the identification of risk areas associated with
billing and cost reporting should be a major component of a nursing facility's compliance
program. 

<p>   The introduction of a prospective payments system (PPS) for Medicare SNFs, consolidated
billing of all services furnished to a resident in a covered Part A stay and the forthcoming
implementation of consolidated billing for SNF residents in a Part B stay create additional issues
to be addressed when designing billing and cost reporting compliance policies and procedures.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> 
In the following discussion of billing risk areas, the OIG has attempted to identify issues that
pose concerns under the current systems of reimbursement and the transition period to
consolidated billing, as well as anticipate potential compliance issues stemming from these
program changes.  As is the case with all aspects of compliance, the nursing facility must
continually reassess its billing procedures and policies to ensure that unanticipated problems are
promptly identified and corrected.  Listed below are some of the reimbursement risk areas a
nursing facility should consider addressing as part of its written compliance policies and
procedures:

<ul>
  <li>		billing for items or services not rendered or provided as claimed;<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>   The OIG recommends that a nursing facility, through its policies and procedures, take all
reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the Federal health care programs when submitting
information that affects reimbursement decisions.  A key component of ensuring accurate
information is the proper and ongoing training and evaluation of the staff responsible for coding
diagnoses and regular internal audits of coding policies and procedures.  With the arrival of
consolidated billing and the next edition of the coding manuals, it will be even more critical that
knowledgeable individuals are performing these coding tasks.

<p>  The risk areas associated with billing and cost reporting have been among the most frequent
subjects of investigations and audits by the OIG.  In addition to facing criminal sanctions and
significant monetary penalties, providers that have failed to adequately ensure the accuracy of
their claims and cost report submissions can have their Medicare payments suspended (42 CFR
405.371), be excluded from program participation (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)), or, in lieu of
exclusion, be required by the OIG to execute a corporate integrity agreement (CIA).<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> 

<br><br>
<strong>d.  Employee Screening</strong>

<p>   Nursing facilities are required by Federal, and in some cases State, law to investigate the
background of certain employees.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>  Nursing facilities should conduct a reasonable and prudent
background investigation and reference check before hiring those employees who have access to
patients or their possessions, or who have discretionary authority to make decisions that may
involve compliance with the law.  The employment application should specifically require the
applicant to disclose any criminal conviction, as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(i); or exclusion
from participation in the Federal health care programs.  Because many of the services provided in
nursing facilities are furnished under arrangement with non-employee personnel, including
registry and personnel agency staff, the nursing facility also should require these individuals to be
subject to the same scrutiny by their agency prior to placement in the facility.  

<p>   This pre-employment screening is critical to ensuring the integrity of the facility's work force
and safeguarding the welfare of its residents.  Because providers of nursing care have frequent,
relatively unsupervised access to vulnerable people and their property, a nursing facility also
should seriously consider whether to employ individuals who have been convicted of crimes of
neglect, violence, theft or dishonesty, financial misconduct, or other offenses related to the
particular job.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a>   

<p>   Nursing facility policies should prohibit the continued employment of individuals who have
been convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are debarred, excluded, or
otherwise become ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  In addition, if
the facility has notice that an employee or contractor is currently charged with a criminal offense
related to the delivery of health care services or is proposed for exclusion during his or her
employment or contract, the facility should take all appropriate actions to ensure that the
responsibilities of that employee or contractor do not adversely affect the quality of care rendered
to any patient or resident, or the accuracy of any claims submitted to any Federal health care
program.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>  If resolution of the matter results in conviction, debarment, or exclusion, the nursing
facility should terminate its employment or contract arrangement with the individual.

<p>   In order to ensure that nursing facilities undertake background checks of all employees to the
extent required by law, the OIG recommends that the following measures be incorporated into
the compliance program's policies and procedures:

<ul>
  <li>	investigate the background of employees by checking with all applicable licensing
and certification authorities to verify that requisite licenses and certifications are
in order;<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	require all potential employees to certify (<u>e.g.</u>, on the employment application)
that they have not been convicted of an offense that would preclude employment
in a nursing facility and that they are not excluded from participation in the
Federal health care programs;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	require temporary employment agencies to ensure that temporary staff assigned to
the facility have undergone background checks that verify that they have not been
convicted of an offense that would preclude employment in the facility;  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	check the OIG's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the GSA's list of
debarred contractors to verify that employees are not excluded from participating
in the Federal health care programs;<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a></li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	require current employees to report to the nursing facility if, subsequent to their
employment, they are convicted of an offense that would preclude employment in
a nursing facility or are excluded from participation in any Federal health care
program; and  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	periodically check the OIG and GSA web sites to verify the
participation/exclusion status of independent contractors and retain on file the
results of that query.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>   Regardless of the size or resources of the nursing facility, employee screening is critical.  
Nursing facilities, like all corporations, must act through their employees and are held
accountable for their actions.  One of the best ways to ensure that the organization will act in
conformance with the law is to hire employees and contractors who can be trusted to embrace a
culture of compliance.  While the resources required to check the OIG List of Excluded
Individuals/Entities are minimal, the absence of an accessible centralized site for criminal
background checks may result in inefficiencies and expense.  While large providers may elect to
outsource the screening process, this may not be a realistic option for smaller nursing facilities.  

<br><br>
Nevertheless, the OIG recommends that all nursing facilities implement a policy to undertake
background checks of all employees.

<p><strong>e.  Kickbacks, Inducements and Self-Referrals</strong>

<p>   A nursing facility should have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-kickback statute,<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> the Stark physician self-referral law<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> and other relevant Federal and State
laws by providing guidance in situations that could lead to a violation of these laws.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>  In
particular, arrangements with hospitals, hospices, physicians and vendors are vulnerable to abuse. 
For example, in the case of hospitals, physicians and hospital staff exert influence over the
patient and can influence the choice of a nursing facility.  In addition, in his or her roles as
medical director and/or attending physician, a physician frequently can influence the utilization
of ancillary services.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a>  Moreover, by contrast, a nursing facility operator can influence the
selection of which hospices will provide hospice services and which vendors will deliver
equipment and services to the facility's residents.  In addition to developing policies to address
arrangements with other health care providers and suppliers, nursing facilities also should
implement measures to avoid offering inappropriate inducements to residents.  Possible risk
areas that should be addressed in the policies and procedures include:

<ul>
  <li>		routinely waiving coinsurance or deductible amounts without a good faith
determination that the resident is in financial need, or absent reasonable efforts to
collect the cost-sharing amount;<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a>  

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		agreements between the facility and a hospital, home health agency, or hospice
that involve the referral or transfer of any resident to or by the nursing home;<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		soliciting, accepting or offering any gift or gratuity of more than nominal value to
or from residents, potential referral sources, and other individuals and entities
with which the nursing facility has a business relationship;<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		conditioning admission or continued stay at a facility on a third-party guarantee of
payment, or soliciting payment for services covered by Medicaid, in addition to
any amount required to be paid under the State Medicaid plan;<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a>  

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		arrangements between a nursing facility and a hospital under which the facility
will only accept a Medicare beneficiary on the condition that the hospital pays the
facility an amount over and above what the facility would receive through PPS;<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> 

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	financial arrangements with physicians, including the facility's medical director;<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	 arrangements with vendors that result in the nursing facility receiving non-covered items (such as disposable adult diapers) at below market prices or no
charge, provided the facility orders Medicare-reimbursed products;<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a> 

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		soliciting or receiving items of value in exchange for providing the supplier access
to residents' medical records and other information needed to bill Medicare;<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		joint ventures with entities supplying goods or services;<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		swapping.<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>   In order to keep current with this area of the law, a nursing facility should obtain copies of all
relevant OIG and HCFA regulations, Special Fraud Alerts, and Advisory Opinions that address
the application of the anti-kickback and Stark self-referral laws to ensure that the policies reflect
current positions and opinions.  Most of these documents are readily available on the Internet.
Further, nursing facility policies should provide that all nursing facility contracts and
arrangements with actual or potential sources of referrals are reviewed by counsel and comply
with applicable statutes and requirements. 

<p><strong>3.  Creation and Retention of Records</strong>

<p><strong>   </strong>When implementing a compliance program, nursing facilities should provide for the
development and implementation of a records system that ensures complete and accurate medical
record documentation.  This system should establish policies and procedures regarding the
creation, distribution, retention, and destruction of documents.  Policies should provide for the
complete, accurate, and timely documentation of all nursing and therapy services, including
subcontracted services, as well as MDS information.  In designing a records systems, privacy
concerns and regulatory requirements also should be taken into consideration.  

<p>   In addition to maintaining appropriate and thorough medical records on each resident, the OIG
recommends that the system should include the following types of documents:

<ul>
  <li>		all records and documentation (<u>e.g.</u>, billing and claims documentation) required
for participation in Federal, State, and private health care programs, including the
resident assessment instrument, the comprehensive plan of care and all corrective
actions taken in response to surveys;<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>				

  </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>		all records, documentation, and audit data that support and explain cost reports
and other financial activity, including any internal or external compliance
monitoring activities; and</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    all records necessary to demonstrate the integrity of the nursing facility
compliance process and to confirm the effectiveness of the program.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>   While conducting its compliance activities, as well as its daily operations, a nursing facility
should document its efforts to comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and Federal health
care program requirements.  For example, where a nursing facility requests advice from a
Government agency (including a Medicare fiscal intermediary or carrier) charged with
administering a Federal health care program, the nursing facility should document and retain a
record of the request and any written or oral response.  This step is extremely important if the
nursing facility intends to rely on that response to guide it in future decisions, actions, or claim
reimbursement requests or appeals.  A log of oral inquiries between the nursing facility and third
parties will help the organization document its attempts at compliance.  In addition, these records
may become relevant in a subsequent investigation to the issue of whether the facility's reliance
was "reasonable" and whether it exercised due diligence in developing procedures and practices
to implement the advice.

<p>   In short, all nursing facilities, regardless of size, must retain appropriate documentation.  
Further, the OIG recommends that the nursing facility:

<ul>
  <li>		secure this information in a safe place;</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>		maintain hard copies of all electronic or database documentation;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> limit access to such documentation to avoid accidental or intentional fabrication
or destruction of records;<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>and
  </ul>
<ul>  <li>		conform document retention and destruction policies to applicable laws.</li>

</ul>

<p>   As the Government increases its reliance on electronic data interchange to conduct business
and gather information more quickly and efficiently, it is important that the nursing facility work
toward the goal of developing the capacity to ensure that all informational systems maintained by
the facility are in working order, secured, and capable of accessing Federal and State databases. 

<p><strong>4.  Compliance as an Element of Employee Performance</strong> 

<p>   Compliance programs should require the promotion of, and adherence to, the elements of the
compliance program to be a factor in evaluating the performance of all employees.  Employees
should be periodically trained in new compliance policies and procedures.  In addition, policies
should require that managers, especially those involved in the direct care of residents and in
claims development and submission:

<ul>
  <li>		discuss with all supervised employees and relevant contractors the compliance
policies and legal requirements applicable to their function;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		inform all supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
procedures is a condition of employment; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		disclose to all supervised personnel that the nursing facility will take disciplinary
action, up to and including termination, for violation of these policies or
requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>   Managers and supervisors should be disciplined for failing to adequately instruct their
subordinates or for failing to detect noncompliance with applicable policies and legal
requirements, where reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of any problems or
violations and given the nursing facility the opportunity to correct them earlier.  Conversely,
those supervisors who have demonstrated leadership in the advancement of the company's code
of conduct and compliance objectives should be singled out for recognition.<p>   The OIG believes that all nursing facilities, regardless of resources or size, should ensure that
its employees understand the importance of compliance with program requirements and the value
the company places on its compliance program.  If the small nursing facility does not have a
formal employee evaluation system, it should informally convey to employees their compliance
responsibilities whenever the opportunity arises.  Positive reenforcement is generally more
effective than sanctions in conditioning behavior and managers should be given mechanisms to
reward employees who promote compliance.

<p><strong>C.  <u>Designation of a Compliance Officer and a Compliance Committee</u></strong>

<p><strong>1.  Compliance Officer</strong>

<p>   Every nursing home provider should designate a compliance officer to serve as the focal point
for compliance activities.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>  This responsibility may be the individual's sole duty or added to
other management responsibilities, depending upon the size and resources of the nursing facility
and the complexity of the task.  Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate authority
is critical to the success of the program, necessitating the appointment of a high-level official
with direct access to the nursing facility's president or CEO, governing body, all other senior
management, and legal counsel.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>  The officer should have sufficient funding and staff to perform
his or her responsibilities fully.  

<p>   Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance officer with regard to
planning, implementing, and monitoring the compliance program.  Particularly in a small facility,
the compliance officer may need to rely on the expertise of several professionals within the
facility to carry out all of his or her responsibilities.  For example, the compliance officer may
need the payment specialist to help with billing issues, the director of nursing to address quality
of care issues, etc.  At the same time, the compliance officer must retain the integrity and
objectivity not to compromise the program in deference to one or more disciplines or
departments.

<p>   The compliance officer's primary responsibilities should include:

<ul>
  <li>	overseeing and monitoring implementation of the compliance program;</li></ul>
  <ul>
  <li>reporting on a regular basis to the nursing facility's governing body, CEO, and
compliance committee (if applicable) on the progress of implementation, and
assisting these components in establishing methods to improve the nursing
facility's efficiency and quality of services, and to reduce the facility's
vulnerability to fraud, abuse, and waste;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs,
and in the law and policies of Government and private payor health plans;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>developing, coordinating, and participating in a multifaceted educational and
training program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program, and
seeking to ensure that all relevant employees and management understand and
comply with pertinent Federal and State standards;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that independent contractors and agents who furnish physician, nursing,
or other health care services to the residents of the nursing facility are aware of the
residents' rights as well as requirements of the nursing facility's compliance
program applicable to the services they provide;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>coordinating personnel issues with the nursing facility's Human
Resources/Personnel office (or its equivalent) to ensure that (i) the National
Practitioner Data Bank<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a> has been checked with respect to all medical staff and
independent contractors (as appropriate) and (ii) the OIG's List of Excluded
Individuals/Entities<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> has been checked with respect to all employees, medical
staff, and independent contractors;<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assisting the nursing facility's financial management in coordinating internal
compliance review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews
of departments;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>	independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including
the flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding to
reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action
(<u>e.g.</u>, making necessary improvements to nursing facility policies and practices,
taking appropriate disciplinary action, etc.) with all nursing facility departments,
subcontracted providers, and health care professionals under the nursing facility's
control;</li> </ul>
<ul>
  <li>	participating with facility's counsel in the appropriate reporting of self-discovered
violations of program requirements; and</li></ul>
<ul><li>continuing the momentum of the compliance program after the initial years of
implementation.<a href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>   The compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other information
that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to, medical and billing
records, and documents concerning the marketing efforts of the nursing facility and its
arrangements with other health care providers, including physicians and independent contractors. 
This review authority enables the compliance officer to examine contracts and obligations
(seeking the advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that may contain referral and payment
provisions that could violate the anti-kickback statute or regulatory requirements.

<br><br>
   A small nursing facility may not have the resources to hire or appoint a full time compliance
officer.  Multi-facility providers also may consider appointing one compliance officer at the
corporate level and designating compliance liaisons at each facility.  In any event, each facility
should have a person in its organization (this person may have other functional responsibilities)
who can oversee the nursing facility's compliance with applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and
policies.  The structure and comprehensiveness of the facility's compliance program will help
determine the responsibilities of each individual compliance officer.

<p><strong>2.  Compliance Committee</strong>

<p>   The OIG recommends that a compliance committee be established to advise the compliance
officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>  When developing an
appropriate team of people to serve as the nursing facility's compliance committee, a facility
should consider a variety of skills and personality traits that are expected from those in such
positions.<a href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>  Once a nursing facility chooses the people that will accept the responsibilities vested
in members of the compliance committee, the nursing facility needs to train these individuals on
the policies and procedures of the compliance program, as well as how to discharge their duties.  

<p>   The committee's functions may include:	
<ul>
  <li>analyzing the legal requirements with which the nursing facility must comply, and
specific risk areas;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>assessing existing policies and procedures that address these risk areas for possible incorporation into the compliance program;
</li> </ul>
<ul>
  <li>working with appropriate departments to develop standards of conduct and
policies and procedures to promote compliance with legal and ethical
requirements;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>departments, the development of internal systems and controls to	carry out the organization's policies;
</li> </ul>	
<ul>
  <li>determining the appropriate strategies and approaches to promote compliance with
program requirements and detection of any potential violations, such as through
hotlines and other fraud reporting mechanisms;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>developing a system to solicit, evaluate, and respond to complaints and problems; and</li> </ul>

<ul>
  <li>	monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
identifying deficiencies, and implementing corrective action. </li>
</ul>

<p>   The committee also may undertake other functions as the compliance concept becomes part of
the overall nursing facility operating structure and daily routine.  The compliance committee is an
extension of the compliance officer and provides the organization with increased oversight.  The
OIG recognizes that some nursing facilities may not have the resources or the need to establish a
compliance committee.  However, when potential problems are identified, the OIG recommends
these nursing facilities create a "task force" to address the particular problem.  The members of
the task force may vary depending upon the issue. 

<p><strong>D.  <u>Conducting  Effective Training and Education</u></strong>

<p>   The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, and health care
professionals, and the continual retraining of current personnel at all levels, are critical elements
of an effective compliance program.  These training programs should include sessions
summarizing the organization's compliance program, fraud and abuse laws, and Federal health
care program and private payor requirements.  More specific training on issues such as claims
development and submission processes, residents' rights, and marketing practices should be
targeted at those employees and contractors whose job requirements make the information
relevant.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a>  

<p>   The organization must take steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all
affected employees, physicians, independent contractors, and other significant agents by
requiring participation in such training programs or by other means, such as disseminating
publications that explain specific requirements in a practical manner.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a>  

<br><br>
   Managers of specific departments or groups can assist in identifying areas that require training
and in carrying out such training.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a>  Training instructors may come from outside or inside the
organization, but must be qualified to present the subject matter involved and sufficiently
experienced in the issues presented to adequately field questions and coordinate discussions
among those being trained.  

<p>   The nursing facility should train new employees soon after they have started working.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> 
Appropriate training for temporary employees should be provided by the facility before they are
assigned responsibility for resident care.  Training programs and materials should be designed to
take into account the skills, experience, and knowledge of the individual trainees.  The
compliance officer should document any formal training undertaken by the nursing facility as
part of the compliance program. 

<p>   A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training and, where a nursing facility has a
culturally diverse staff, training in different languages, should be implemented so that all affected
employees (including temporary employees) understand the institution's standards of conduct
and procedures for alerting senior management to problems and concerns.<a href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a>  

<br><br>
   In addition to specific training in the risk areas identified in section II.B.2, primary training for
appropriate corporate officers, managers, and facility staff should include such topics as:	
<ul>
  <li>compliance with Medicare participation requirements relevant to their respective
duties and responsibilities;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	appropriate and sufficient documentation;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>prohibitions on paying or receiving remuneration to induce referrals; </li></ul>
<ul>  <li>proper documentation in clinical or financial records;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	residents' rights; and</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>the duty to report misconduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>   The OIG suggests that all relevant personnel participate in the various educational and training
programs of the nursing facility.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>  Employees should be required to have a minimum number of
educational hours per year, as appropriate, as part of their employment responsibilities.<a href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a>   For
example, for certain employees involved in the nursing facility admission functions, periodic
training in applicable reimbursement coverage and eligibility requirements should be required. 
In nursing facilities with high employee turnover, periodic training updates are critical. 

<p>   The OIG recognizes that the format of the training program will vary depending upon the
resources of the nursing facility.  For example, a nursing facility with limited resources may want
to create a videotape for each type of training session so new employees can receive training in a
timely manner.  If videos are used for compliance training, the OIG suggests that a nursing
facility make a knowledgeable individual available to field questions from video trainees. 

<p>   The OIG recommends that participation in training programs be made a condition of continued
employment and that failure to comply with training requirements should result in disciplinary
action, when such failure is serious.  Adherence to the training requirements as well as other
provisions of the compliance program should be a factor in the annual evaluation of each
employee.  The nursing facility should retain adequate records of its training of employees,
including attendance logs and material distributed at training sessions.

<p><strong>E.  <u>Developing Effective Lines of Communication</u></strong>

<p><strong>1.  Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> 

<p>   In order for a compliance program to work, employees must be able to ask questions and report
problems.  The first line supervisors play a key role in responding to employee concerns and it is
appropriate that they serve as a first line of communications.  In order to encourage
communications, confidentiality and non-retaliation policies should be developed and distributed
to all employees.<a href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a>  

<p>   Open lines of communication between the compliance officer and nursing facility employees is
equally important to the successful implementation of a compliance program and the reduction of
any potential for fraud and abuse.  In addition to serving as a contact point for reporting
problems, the compliance officer should be viewed as someone to whom personnel can go to get
clarification on the facility's policies.  Questions and responses should be documented and dated
and, if appropriate, shared with other staff so that standards can be updated and improved to
reflect any necessary changes or clarifications.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>  

<p><strong>2.  Hotlines</strong> <strong>and Other Forms of Communication</strong>

<p>   The OIG encourages the use of hotlines,<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> e-mails, newsletters, suggestion boxes, and other
forms of information exchange to maintain open lines of communication.<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a>  If the nursing facility
establishes a hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available to all employees,
independent contractors, residents, and family members by circulating the number on wallet
cards or conspicuously posting the telephone number in common work areas.  Nursing facilities
also are required to post the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all pertinent State client
advocacy groups such as the State survey and certification agency, State licensure office, State
ombudsman program, the protection and advocacy network, and the State Medicaid Fraud
Control Unit.<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>   

<p>  Employees should be permitted to report matters on an anonymous basis.  Matters reported
through the hotline or other communication sources that suggest substantial violations of
compliance policies or Federal health care program statutes and regulations should be
documented and investigated promptly to determine their veracity.  The compliance officer
should maintain a log that records such calls, including the nature of any investigation and its
results.<a href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a>  Such information, redacted of individual identifiers, should be included in reports to
the governing body, the CEO, and compliance committee.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>  While the nursing facility should
always strive to maintain the confidentiality of an employee's identity, it also should make clear
that there may be a point where the individual's identity may become known or may have to be
revealed in certain instances.  The OIG recognizes that protecting anonymity may be infeasible
for small nursing facilities.  However, the OIG believes all facility employees, when seeking
answers to questions or reporting potential instances of fraud and abuse, should know to whom to
turn for attention and should be able to do so without fear of retribution. 

<p><strong>F.  <u>Auditing and Monitoring</u></strong>

<p>   The OIG believes that an effective program should incorporate thorough monitoring of its
implementation and an ongoing evaluation process.  The compliance officer should document
this ongoing monitoring, including reports of suspected noncompliance, and share these
assessments with the nursing facility's senior management and the compliance committee.  The
extent and frequency of the compliance audits may vary depending on variables such as the
nursing facility's available resources, prior history of noncompliance, and the risk factors
particular to the facility.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a>

<p>   Although many assessment techniques are available, one effective tool is the performance of
regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or external evaluators who have expertise in
Federal and State health care statutes, regulations, and program requirements, as well as private
payor rules.  These assessments should focus both on the nursing facility's day-to-day operations,
as well as its adherence to the rules governing claims development, billing and cost reports, and
relationships with third parties.  The reviews also should address the nursing facility's
compliance with Medicare requirements and the specific rules and policies that have been the
focus of particular attention by the Medicare fiscal intermediaries or carriers, survey agencies,
and law enforcement.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> 

<p>   Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer to
identify and review variations from an established performance baseline.<a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>  This performance
baseline should include measurable patient outcomes, such as resident weight maintenance and
pressure ulcers, established by the facility's Quality Assessment and Assurance Committee.  
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger an inquiry to determine the cause of the
deviation.  If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for legitimate reasons, the
compliance officer and nursing facility management may want to take no action.  If it is
determined that the deviation was caused by a departure from or misunderstanding of the
facility's policies, the nursing facility should take prompt steps to correct the problem.  Any
overpayments discovered as a result of such deviations should be returned promptly to the
affected payor,<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a> with appropriate documentation and a sufficiently detailed explanation of the
reason for the refund.<a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>  						

<p>   In addition to evaluating the facility's conformance with program rules, an effective
compliance program also should incorporate periodic (at least annual) reviews of whether the
program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>, whether there has been appropriate
dissemination of the program's standards, ongoing educational programs, and internal
investigations of alleged non-compliance.  This process will assess actual conformance by all
departments with the compliance program and may identify areas for improvements in the
program, as well as the nursing facility's general operations. 

<br><br>
   The OIG requires a provider operating under a CIA to conduct an annual assessment of its
compliance with the elements of the CIA.  A compliance officer may want to review several
CIAs in designing the facility's self-audit protocol.<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>

<p>   As part of the review process, the compliance officer or reviewers should consider techniques
such as:

<ul>
  <li>		on-site visits to all facilities owned and/or operated by the nursing home owner;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		testing the billing and claims reimbursement staff on its knowledge of applicable
program requirements and claims and billing criteria;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		unannounced mock surveys and audits;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		examination of the organization's complaint logs and investigative files;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>		legal assessment of all contractual relationships with contractors, consultants and
potential referral sources;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>	reevaluation of deficiencies cited in past surveys for State requirements and
Medicare participation requirements;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	checking personnel records to determine whether individuals who previously have
been reprimanded for compliance issues are now conforming to facility policies; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>questionnaires developed to solicit impressions of a broad cross-section of the
nursing facility's employees and staff concerning adherence to the code of
conduct and policies and procedures, as well as their work loads and ability to
address the residents' activities of daily living;</li></ul>
<ul>  <li>	validation of qualifications of nursing facility physicians and other staff, including
verification of applicable State license renewals;   </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>trend analysis, or longitudinal studies, that uncover deviations in specific areas
over a given period; and</li></ul>

<ul>  <li>	analyzing past survey reports for patterns of deficiencies to determine if the
proposed corrective plan of action identified and corrected the underlying
problem. </li>
</ul>

<p>   The reviewers should:

<ul>
  <li>	have the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential
issues with the subject matter that is reviewed;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>be objective and independent of line management to the extent reasonably
possible;<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>have access to existing audit and health care resources, relevant personnel, and all
relevant areas of operation;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing
body, and members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but no less
often than annually; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed.</li>

</ul>

<p>   The extent and scope of a nursing facility's compliance self-audits will depend on the facility's
identified risk areas, past history of deficiencies and enforcement actions, and resources.  If the
facility comes under Government scrutiny in the future, the Government will assess whether the
facility developed a reasonable audit plan based upon identified risk areas and resources.  If the
Government determines that the nursing facility failed to develop an adequate audit program, the
Government will be less likely to afford the nursing facility favorable treatment under the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines.<strong></strong>

<p><strong>G.  <u>Enforcing Standards Through Well-Publicized Disciplinary Guidelines</u></strong>

<p><strong>1.  Disciplinary Policy and Enforcement</strong>

<p>   An effective compliance program should include disciplinary policies that set out the
consequences of violating the nursing facility's standards of conduct, policies, and procedures. 
Intentional noncompliance should subject transgressors to significant sanctions.  Such sanctions
could range from oral warnings to suspension, termination, or financial penalties, as appropriate. 
Disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible employee's failure to detect a
violation is attributable to his or her negligence or reckless conduct.  Each situation must be
considered on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate response.  

<p>   The written standards of conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling disciplinary
problems and those who will be responsible for taking appropriate action.  Some disciplinary
actions can be handled by department or agency managers, while others may have to be resolved
by a senior administrator.  The nursing facility should advise personnel that disciplinary action
will be taken on a fair and equitable basis.  Managers and supervisors should be made aware that
they have a responsibility to discipline employees in an appropriate and consistent manner.

<p>   It is vital to publish and disseminate the range of disciplinary standards for improper conduct
and to educate employees regarding these standards.  The consequences of noncompliance should
be consistently applied and enforced, in order for the disciplinary policy to have the required
deterrent effect.  All levels of employees should be potentially subject to the same types of
disciplinary action for the commission of similar offenses, because the commitment to
compliance applies to all personnel within a nursing facility.  This means that corporate officers,
managers, and supervisors should be held accountable for failing to comply with, or for the
foreseeable failure of their subordinates to adhere to, the applicable standards, laws, and
procedures.

<p><strong>H.  <u>Responding to Detected Offenses and Developing Corrective Action Initiatives</u></strong>

<p>   Violations of a nursing facility's compliance program, failures to comply with applicable
Federal or State law, and other types of misconduct threaten a facility's status as a reliable,
honest and trustworthy provider of health care.  Detected but uncorrected deficiencies can
seriously endanger the reputation and legal status of the nursing facility.  Consequently, upon
receipt of reports or reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance, it is important that the
compliance officer or other management officials immediately investigate the allegations to
determine whether a material violation of applicable law or the requirements of the compliance
program has occurred and, if so, take decisive steps to correct the problem.<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>  As appropriate,
such steps may include a corrective action plan,<a href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a> the return of any overpayments, a report to the
Government,<a href="#N_111_"><sup>(111)</sup></a> and/or a referral to criminal and/or civil law enforcement authorities.

<p>   Where potential fraud is not involved, the OIG recommends that the nursing facility use normal
repayment channels to return overpayments as they are discovered.  However, even if the nursing
facility's billing department is effectively using the overpayment detection and return process,
the OIG believes that the facility needs to alert the compliance officer to those overpayments that
may reveal trends or patterns indicative of a systemic problem. 

<p>   Where there are indications of potential fraud, an internal investigation may be warranted and
will probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents.  Under some
circumstances, the facility may need to consider engaging outside counsel, auditors, or health
care experts to assist in an investigation.  The investigative file should contain documentation of
the alleged violation, a description of the investigative process (including the objectivity of the
investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of interview notes and key documents, a log of
the witnesses interviewed and the documents reviewed, the results of the investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any
disciplinary action taken, and the corrective action implemented.  While any action taken as the
result of an investigation will necessarily vary depending upon the situation, nursing facilities
should strive for some consistency by using sound practices and disciplinary protocols.<a href="#N_112_"><sup>(112)</sup></a> 
Further, the compliance officer should review the circumstances that formed the basis for the
investigation to determine whether similar problems have been uncovered or modifications of the
compliance program are necessary to prevent and detect other inappropriate conduct or
violations.

<p>   If the nursing facility undertakes an investigation of an alleged violation and the compliance
officer believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because of the presence of
employees under investigation, the facility should remove those individuals from their current
responsibilities until the investigation is completed (unless there is an ongoing internal or
Government-led undercover operation known to the nursing facility).  In addition, the
compliance officer should take appropriate steps to secure or prevent the destruction of
documents or other evidence relevant to the investigation.  If the nursing facility determines that
disciplinary action is warranted, it should be promptly imposed in accordance with the facility's
written standards of disciplinary action.  

<p><strong>1. Reporting</strong>

<p>   Where the compliance officer, compliance committee, or a management official discovers
credible evidence of misconduct from any source and, after a reasonable inquiry, has reason to
believe that the misconduct may violate criminal, civil or administrative law, the facility should
promptly report the existence of misconduct to the appropriate Federal and State authorities<a href="#N_113_"><sup>(113)</sup></a>
within a reasonable period, but not more than 60 days<a href="#N_114_"><sup>(114)</sup></a> after determining that there is credible
evidence of a violation.<a href="#N_115_"><sup>(115)</sup></a>  Prompt voluntary reporting will demonstrate the nursing facility's
good faith and willingness to work with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the
problem.  In addition, reporting such conduct will be considered a mitigating factor by the OIG in
determining administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>, penalties, assessments, and exclusion), if the reporting
provider becomes the target of an OIG investigation.<a href="#N_116_"><sup>(116)</sup></a>

<p>   When reporting to the Government, a nursing facility should provide all evidence relevant to
the alleged violation of applicable Federal or State law(s) and potential cost impact.  The
compliance officer, under advice of counsel and with guidance from the governmental
authorities, could be requested to continue to investigate the reported violation.  Once the
investigation is completed, the compliance officer should notify the appropriate governmental
authority of the outcome of the investigation, including a description of the impact of the alleged
violation on the operation of the applicable health care programs or their beneficiaries.  If the
investigation ultimately reveals that criminal, civil or administrative violations have occurred, the
nursing facility should immediately notify appropriate Federal and State authorities.

<p>   As previously stated, the nursing facility should take appropriate corrective action, including
prompt identification and return of any overpayment to the affected payor.  If potential fraud is
involved, the nursing facility should return any overpayment during the course of its disclosure to
the Government.  Otherwise, the nursing facility should use normal repayment channels for
reimbursing identified overpayments.<a href="#N_117_"><sup>(117)</sup></a>  A knowing and willful failure to disclose overpayments
within a reasonable period of time could be interpreted as an attempt to conceal the overpayment
from the Government, thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation with
respect to the nursing facility, as well as any individual who may have been involved.<a href="#N_118_"><sup>(118)</sup></a>   For this
reason, nursing facility compliance programs should emphasize that overpayments should be
promptly disclosed and returned to the entity that made the erroneous payment. 

<p><strong>III.  ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</strong>

<p>   Considering the financial and human resources needed to establish an effective compliance
program, sound business principles dictate that the nursing home's management evaluate the
return on that investment.  In addition, a compliance program must be "effective" for the
Government to view its existence as a mitigating factor when assessing culpability.  How a
nursing facility assesses its compliance program performance is therefore integral to its success. 
The attributes of each individual element of a compliance program must be evaluated in order to
assess the program's "effectiveness" as a whole.  Examining the comprehensiveness of policies
and procedures implemented to satisfy these elements is merely the first step.  Evaluating how a
compliance program performs during the provider's day-to-day operations becomes the critical
indicator.<a href="#N_119_"><sup>(119)</sup></a>

<p>   As previously stated, a compliance program should require the development and distribution of
written compliance policies, standards, and practices that identify specific areas of risk and
vulnerability.  One way to judge whether these policies, standards, and practices measure up is to
observe how an organization's employees react to them.  Do employees experience recurring
pitfalls because the guidance on certain issues is not adequately covered in company policies? 
Do employees flagrantly disobey an organization's standards of conduct because they observe no
sincere buy-in from senior management?  Do employees have trouble understanding policies and
procedures because they are written in legalese or at difficult reading levels?  Does an
organization routinely experience systematic billing failures because of poor instructions to
employees on how to implement written policies and practices?  Written compliance policies,
standards, and practices are only as good as an organization's commitment to apply them in
practice.

<p>   Every nursing facility needs to seriously consider whoever fills the integral roles of compliance
officer and compliance committee members, and periodically monitor how the individuals
chosen satisfy their responsibilities.  Does a compliance officer have sufficient professional
experience working with billing, clinical records, documentation, and auditing principles to
perform assigned responsibilities fully?  Has a compliance officer or compliance committee been
unsuccessful in fulfilling their duties because of inadequate funding, staff, and authority
necessary to carry out their jobs?  Did the addition of the compliance officer function to a key
management position with other significant duties compromise the goals of the compliance
program (<u>e.g.</u>, chief financial officer who discounts certain overpayments identified to improve
the company's bottom line profits)?  Since a compliance officer and a compliance committee can
have a significant impact on how effectively a compliance program is implemented, those
functions should not be taken for granted.

<p>   As evidenced throughout this guidance, the proper education and training of corporate officers,
managers, health care professionals, and other applicable employees of a provider, and the
continual retraining of current personnel at all levels, are significant elements of an effective
compliance program.  Accordingly, such efforts should be routinely evaluated.  How frequently
are employees trained?  Are employees tested after training?  Do the training sessions and
materials adequately summarize the important aspects of the organization's compliance
program?  Are training instructors qualified to present the subject matter and field questions? 
When thorough compliance training is periodically conducted, employees receive the
reinforcement they need to ensure an effective compliance program.

<p>   An open line of communication between the compliance officer and a provider's employees is
equally important to the success of a compliance program.  In today's intensive regulatory
environment, the OIG believes that a provider cannot possibly have an effective compliance
program if it does not receive feedback from its employees regarding compliance matters.  For
instance, if a compliance officer does not receive appropriate inquiries from employees:  Do
policies and procedures adequately guide employees to whom and when they should be
communicating compliance matters?  Are employees confident that they can report compliance
matters to management without fear of retaliation?  Are employees reporting issues through the
proper channels?  Do employees have the proper motives for reporting compliance matters? 
Regardless of the means that a provider uses, whether it is telephone hotline, email, or suggestion
boxes, employees should seek clarification from compliance staff in the event of any confusion
or question dealing with compliance policies, practices, or procedures.

<p>   An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action for
corporate officers, managers, health care professionals, and other employees who have failed to
adhere to an organization's standards of conduct, Federal health care program requirements, or
Federal or State laws.  The number and caliber of disciplinary actions taken by an organization
can be insightful.  Have appropriate sanctions been applied to compliance misconduct?  Are
sanctions applied to all employees consistently, regardless of an employee's level in the corporate
hierarchy?  Have double-standards in discipline bred cynicism among employees?  When
disciplinary action is not taken seriously or applied haphazardly, such practices reflect poorly on
senior management's commitment to foster compliance as well as the effectiveness of an
organization's compliance program in general.

<p>   Another critical component of a successful compliance program is an ongoing monitoring and
auditing process.  The extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors
such as the size and available resources, prior history of noncompliance, and risk factors of a
particular nursing facility.  The hallmark of effective monitoring and auditing efforts is how an
organization determines the parameters of its reviews.  Do audits focus on all pertinent
departments of an organization?  Does an audit cover compliance with all applicable laws, as
well as Federal and private payor requirements?  Are results of past audits, pre-established
baselines, or prior deficiencies reevaluated?  Are the elements of the compliance program
monitored?  Are auditing techniques valid and conducted by objective reviewers?  The extent
and sincerity of an organization's efforts to confirm its compliance often proves to be a revealing
determinant of a compliance program's effectiveness.

<p>   It is essential that the compliance officer or other management officials immediately investigate
reports or reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance.  If a material violation of
applicable law or compliance program requirements has occurred, a provider must take decisive
steps to correct the problem.  Nursing facilities that do not thoroughly investigate misconduct
leave themselves open to undiscovered problems.  When a provider learns of certain issues, it
should evaluate how it assesses its legal exposure.  What is the correlation between the
deficiency identified and the corrective action necessary to remedy?  Are isolated overpayment
matters properly resolved through normal repayment channels?  Is credible evidence of
misconduct that may violate criminal, civil or administrative law promptly reported to the
appropriate Federal and State authorities?  If the process of responding to detected offenses is
circumvented, such conduct would indicate an ineffective compliance program.  

<p>   Documentation is the key to demonstrating the effectiveness of a nursing facility's compliance
program.  For example, documentation of the following should be maintained:  audit results; logs
of hotline calls and their resolution; corrective action plans; due diligence efforts regarding
business transactions; records of employee training, including the number of training hours;
disciplinary action; and modification and distribution of policies and procedures.  Because the
OIG encourages self-disclosure of overpayments and billing irregularities, maintaining a record
of disclosures and refunds to the Federal health care programs and private insurers is strongly
endorsed.  A documented practice of refunding of overpayments and self-disclosing incidents of
non-compliance with Federal and private payor health care program requirements is powerful
evidence of a meaningful compliance effort. 

<p><strong>IV.  CONCLUSION</strong>

<p>   Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation for the process
necessary to develop an effective and cost-efficient nursing facility compliance program. 
However, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources of a particular facility,
depending upon its unique corporate structure, mission, and employee composition.  The statutes,
regulations, and guidelines of the Federal health care programs, as well as the policies and procedures of private health plans, should be integrated into every nursing
facility's compliance program. 

<br><br>
   The OIG recognizes that the health care industry in this country, which reaches millions of
beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly evolving.  The time is
right for nursing facilities to implement a strong voluntary health care compliance program. 
Compliance is a dynamic process that helps to ensure that nursing facilities and other health care
providers are better able to fulfill their commitment to ethical behavior, as well as meet the
changes and challenges being placed upon them by Congress and private insurers.  Ultimately, it
is the OIG's hope that a voluntarily created compliance program will enable nursing facilities to
meet their goals, improve the quality of resident care, and substantially reduce fraud, waste, and
abuse, as well as the cost of health care to Federal, State, and private health insurers.

<br><br>
<a name="N_1_">1. </a>The OIG has issued compliance program guidances for the following seven industry
sectors:  hospitals, clinical laboratories, home health agencies, durable medical equipment
suppliers, third-party medical billing companies, hospices, and  Medicare+Choice organizations
offering coordinated care plans.  Over the next year, the OIG plans to issue compliance guidances
for ambulance companies and individual and small group physician practices.
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>For the purpose of this guidance, the term "nursing facility" includes a skilled nursing
facility (SNF) and a nursing facility (NF) that meet the requirements of sections 1819 and 1919
of the Social Security Act (Act), respectively, 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3 and 42 U.S.C. 1396r.  Where
appropriate, we distinguish between SNFs and other nursing facilities.
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>The term "Federal health care programs" includes any plan or program that provides
health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded directly, in
whole or in part, by the United States Government (<u>i.e.</u>, via programs such as Medicare, Federal
Employees Health Benefits Act, Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Black Lung, or the
Longshore and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act) or any State health plan (<u>e.g.</u>, Medicaid, or
a program receiving funds from block grants for social services or child health services).  <u>See</u> 42
U.S.C. 1320a-7b(f).  In this document, the term "Federal health care program requirements"
refers to the statutes, regulations and other written directives governing Medicare, Medicaid, and
all other Federal health care programs.
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>Recent case law suggests that the failure of a corporate director to attempt in good faith
to institute a compliance program in certain situations may be a breach of a director's fiduciary
obligation.  <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In re Caremark Int'l Inc. Derivative Litig.</u>, 698 A.2d 959, 970 (Ct. Chanc.
Del. 1996).  
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a><u>See</u> 63 FR 70137 (December 12, 1998), Notice for Solicitation of Information and
Recommendations for Developing OIG Compliance Program Guidance for the Nursing Home
Industry.<u></u>
<p><a name="N_6_">6. </a>The OIG periodically issues advisory opinions responding 
  to specific inquires concerning the application of the OIG's authorities and 
  Special Fraud Alerts, setting forth activities that raise legal and enforcement 
  issues. These documents, as well as reports from OAS and OEI can be obtained 
  on the Internet at:<em> http://oig.hhs.gov.</em>  
  We also recommend that nursing home providers regularly review the Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) website on the Internet at: <em>http://www.hcfa.gov</em>, 
  for up-to-date regulations, manuals, and program memoranda related to the Medicare 
  and Medicaid programs. 
<p><a name="N_7_">7. </a>Counsel to the nursing facility should be consulted as appropriate regarding
interpretation and legal analysis of laws related to the Federal health care programs and laws
related to fraud, abuse and other legal requirements.
<p><a name="N_8_">8. </a>For example, the OIG will consider the existence of an <em>effective</em> compliance program
that pre-dated any governmental investigation when addressing the appropriateness of
administrative sanctions.  However, the burden is on the nursing facility to demonstrate the
operational effectiveness of the compliance program.  Further, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
3729-3733, provides that a person who has violated the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the
violation to the Government within 30 days of detection, in certain circumstances will be subject
to not less than double, as opposed to treble, damages.  <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 3729(a).  In addition,
criminal sanctions may be mitigated by an effective compliance program that was in place at the
time of the criminal offense.  <u>See</u> note 11. 
<p><a name="N_9_">9. </a>For example, this would include providers that own hospitals, skilled nursing facilities,
long term care facilities and hospices.
<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a>A formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of directors, owner(s), or
president, where applicable.  Evidence of that commitment should include the allocation of
adequate resources, a timetable, and the identification of an individual to serve as a compliance
officer or coordinator to ensure that each of the recommended and adopted elements is addressed. 
Once a commitment has been established, a compliance officer should immediately be chosen to
oversee the implementation and ongoing operation of the compliance program.
<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a><u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2,
Application Note 3(k).  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and practices for
the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe the appropriate sanctions for offenders
convicted of Federal crimes.
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>The roles of the compliance officer and the corporate compliance committee in
implementing an effective compliance program are discussed throughout this guidance. 
However, the OIG recognizes that differences in the sizes and structures of nursing facilities may
result in differences in the ways in which compliance programs function. 
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>Training and educational programs for nursing facilities should be detailed,
comprehensive and at the same time targeted to address the needs of specific employees based on
their responsibilities within the facility.  Existing in-service training programs can be expanded
to address general compliance issues, as well as the risk areas identified in that part of nursing
home operations.  
<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>For example, periodically spot-checking the work of coding and billing personnel
should be part of a compliance program.  In addition, procedures to regularly monitor the care
provided to nursing facility residents and to ensure that deficiencies identified by surveyors are
corrected should be incorporated into the compliance program's evaluation and monitoring
functions. 
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>According to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an organization must have established
compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other agents in order
to receive sentencing credit for an "effective" compliance program.  The Federal Sentencing
Guidelines define "agent" as "any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an
independent contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization."  <u>See</u> United States
Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(d).
<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>The OIG strongly encourages the participation and involvement of the nursing facility's
owner(s), governing board, CEO, as well as other personnel from various levels of the
organizational structure in the development of all aspects of the compliance program, especially
the standards of conduct.  Management and employee involvement in this process communicates
a strong and explicit commitment to all employees of the need to comply with the organization's
standards of conduct. 
<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>The code also should be distributed, or at least available, to the residents and their
families, as well as the physicians and contractors associated with the facility.
<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>Documentation of employee training and other compliance efforts is important in
conducting internal assessments of the compliance program, as well as during any third-party
evaluation of the facility's efforts to comply with Federal health care program requirements.  <u>See</u>
section II.F.  
<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a><u>See</u> <em>http://www.hcfa.gov</em> for information on obtaining a set of all Medicare and
Medicaid manuals.
<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>In addition, all providers should be aware of the enforcement priorities of Federal and
State regulators and law enforcement agencies.  OIG periodically issues Special Fraud Alerts and
Special Advisory Bulletins that identify activities believed to raise enforcement concerns. These
documents and other materials that provide insight into the nursing home enforcement priorities
of the OIG are referenced throughout this guidance.
<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>The OIG recommends that, in addition to the list set forth below, the provider review
the OIG's Work Plan to identify vulnerabilities and risk areas on which the OIG will focus
during the following year.  In addition, it is recommended that the nursing facility routinely
review the OIG's semiannual reports, which identify program vulnerabilities and risk areas that
the OIG has targeted during the preceding six months.  All of these documents are available on
the OIG's webpage at <em>http://www.hhs.gov/oig</em>.
<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>State and local agencies enter into agreements with DHHS under which they survey and
make recommendations regarding whether providers meet the Medicare participation
requirements or other requirements for SNFs and NFs.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 488.10, 488.12.
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>42 CFR 483.25.  <u>See</u> OIG report OEI-02-98-00060 "Quality of Care in Nursing Homes:
An Overview," in which the OIG found that, although the overall number of deficiencies
identified through the survey and certification process was decreasing, the number of "quality of
care" and other serious deficiencies was increasing. 
<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a><u>See</u> 42 CFR part 483, which establishes requirements for long term care facilities.
HCFA's regulations establish requirements that must be met for a nursing facility to qualify to
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  State licensure laws may impose additional
requirements for the establishment and certification of a nursing facility.
<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a><u>See</u> 42 CFR part 488, subparts A, B, C, E, and F.  The survey instrument is used to
identify deficiencies, such as: failure to notify residents of their rights; improper use of restraints
for discipline purposes; lack of a clean and safe environment; failure to provide care for basic
living activities, including failing to prevent and/or treat pressure ulcers, urinary incontinence and
hydration; and failing to properly feed residents. 
<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>As stated above, each resident must receive the necessary care and services to attain or
maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being, in accordance
with the resident's assessment and plan of care.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.25.  The OIG recognizes that
this standard does not always lend itself to easy, objective evaluation.  The matter is further
complicated by the right of the resident, or his or her legal representative, to decide on a course
of treatment that may be contraindicated.  The Patient Self-Determination Act (Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-508, sec. 4206 and 4751) requires health care
institutions to educate patients about advance directives and to document their decision on life-sustaining treatments.
<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>HCFA has created a repository of best practice guidelines 
  for the care of residents at risk of pressure ulcers, dehydration, malnutrition, 
  and other clinical conditions. <u>See</u> <a href="http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/siq/siqhmpg.htm"><em>http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/siq/siqhmpg.htm.</em><u></u></a>
<p>
<u><a name="N_28_">28. </a></u>42 CFR 483.15(e)(1).
<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>The OIG has conducted a series of reviews that focused on prescription drug use in
nursing homes.  <u>See</u> OIG reports OEI-06-96-00080, OEI-06-96-00081, OEI-06-96-00082 --
"Prescription Drug Use in Nursing Homes - Reports 1, 2 and 3."  The OIG found that patients
experienced adverse reactions to various drugs as a result of inappropriate prescribing and
inadequate monitoring of medication usage.  The reviews revealed serious concerns, including
residents receiving drugs for which their medical records lacked evidence of a prescription and
the prescription of drugs judged inappropriate for use by elderly persons.  The studies also found
that medication records were often incomplete and not readily accessible, making it difficult for a
pharmacist to identify or confirm drug regimens or problems.
<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>For example, Federal regulations require that the medical care of each resident be
supervised by a physician, who must see the resident at least once every 30 days for the first 90
days after admission and at least once every 60 days thereafter.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.40(c).  The
facility also must retain the services of a registered nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7
days a week (42 CFR 483.30), as well as a qualified dietitian (42 CFR 483.35).  In addition to
these basic Federal requirements, the OIG strongly believes that the facility should conform to
State-mandated staffing levels where they exist and, in addition, adopt its own minimum "hours
per patient" (or acuity) staffing standards<strike></strike>.  A facility should ensure that it has a sufficient number
of staff, including registered nurses (RNs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs,) Certified Nurses
Assistants (CNAs) and Nursing Assistants (collectively "Nursing Staff") and other health care
professionals to fully meet the needs of all of its residents.  Sufficient staff should be provided to
ensure that residents receive nursing and other health care services on a 24-hour basis that allows
each resident to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being as determined by individual resident assessments and plans of care.  A facility should
establish staffing standards on a facility-specific (or, often more appropriately, a unit-specific)
basis that reflect the acuity level and needs of the residents.  The use of an acuity level/staffing
ratio model gives the facility the ability to adjust staffing levels as resident needs fluctuate, as
well as a basis for conducting compliance audits.  On an ongoing basis, the compliance officer
should monitor the facility's compliance with the staffing ratios established by the quality
assurance committee, to ensure that the facility maintains staffing levels sufficient to serve
resident needs.  At the heart of many quality of care deficiencies is a lack of adequate staff
needed to provide basic nursing services.
<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a><u>See</u> OIG report OEI-09-97-00120 "Medical Necessity of Physical and Occupational
Therapy in Skilled Nursing Facilities," which found a high rate of medically unnecessary
therapies in a number of nursing facilities; such unnecessary services may lead to inappropriate
care.  <u>See also</u> OAS Report A-06-99-00058 "Infusion Therapy Services Provided in Skilled
Nursing Facilities," which found similar problems with unnecessary infusion therapy services. 
With the introduction of the prospective payment system, nursing facilities should ensure that
financial pressures do not create incentives to <u>underutilize</u> medically necessary therapeutic
services.
<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>In addition to providing the facility's management important information about the state
of care in the facility, the self-reporting of resident abuse, including injuries of unknown sources,
is a condition of participation.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.13(c)(2).  Although State surveyors conduct
complaint surveys when they receive a complaint, these surveys can only occur if the surveyors
are aware of the problem.
<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a><u>See generally</u>, 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3 and 42 CFR part 483.
<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>In OIG report OEI-02-98-00350 "Long Term Ombudsman Program: Complaint
Trends," the OIG points out that complaints about resident care and resident rights have been
increasing.  Resident care concerns included complaints about personal care, such as pressure
ulcers and hygiene, lack of rehabilitation, the inappropriate use of restraints, abuse and neglect,
problems with admissions and eviction, and the exercise of personal rights.  Some ombudsmen
observed that the increasing number of complaints could be due to a greater presence of
ombudsmen staff in nursing homes.  However, a comparison of each State's staffing ratio and
visitation rate to their complaint ratio found that States with more staff and more frequent visits
did not necessarily have more complaints.
<p><a name="N_35_">35. </a>Nursing facilities must offer care to all residents who are eligible in accordance with
Federal and State laws governing admissions.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.12(d).  The provider also must
maintain identical policies regarding "transfer, discharge, and provision of services under the
State plan" for all residents, regardless of payment source.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.12(c).  <u>See also</u> OIG
report OEI-02-99-00401 "Early Effects of the Prospective Payment System on Access to Skilled
Nursing Facilities."  It also is inappropriate to condition admission on a prospective resident's
agreement to hold the facility harmless for injuries or poor care provided to the individual.
<p><a name="N_36_">36. </a><u>See</u> <u>California Nursing Homes: Care Problems Persist Despite Federal and State
Oversight</u>, GAO/HEHS-98-202 (July 1998).  As noted previously, the facility must establish a
process by which the facility administrator and other officials in accordance with State law
(including the State survey and certification agency) are informed of incidents of abuse and an
investigation is conducted within 5 days of the incident.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.13(c)(4).
<p><a name="N_37_">37. </a> <u>See</u> OIG report OEI-01-91-00840 "Minimizing Restraints in Nursing Homes: A Guide

<p><a name="N_38_">38. </a>It is a violation of the Medicare participation requirements to make unauthorized
disclosures from the resident's medical records.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(e).  The facility also must
establish policies that respect each resident's right to privacy in personal communications,
including the right to receive mail that is unopened and to the use of a telephone where calls can
be made in privacy.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(i) and (k).
<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>The right of self-determination includes the resident's right to choose a personal
physician, to be fully informed of his or her health status, and participate in advance in treatment
decisions, including the right to refuse treatment, unless adjudged incompetent or incapacitated. 
<u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(d).
<p><a name="N_40_">40. </a>This includes preserving the resident's right to manage his or her financial affairs or
permit the facility to hold and manage personal funds.  The resident must receive a full and
complete accounting of personal funds held by the facility.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(c).  If
misappropriation of a resident's property is uncovered, the facility administrator and other
officials, in accordance with State law, must be notified immediately and an investigation
conducted.  Finally, the provider must take measures to ensure that personal funds have not been
used to pay for items or services paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.  <u>Id.</u>
<p><a name="N_41_">41. </a><u>See</u> OIG report A-17-99-00099 "Improper Fiscal Year 1998 Fee-for-Service Payments,"
in which the OIG estimated that improper Medicare benefit payments made during fiscal year
1998 totaled $12.6 billion in processed fee-for-service payments.  SNF payment errors were a
result of claims for services lacking medical necessity and represented 7 percent of the total
estimated improper payments.  The OIG could not and did not quantify what percentage of the
improper payments was the result of fraud.  Significantly, it was only through a review of
medical records that the majority of these billing errors were detected, since when the claims
were submitted to the Medicare contractor, they contained no visible errors. 
<p><a name="N_42_">42. </a>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) (Pub. L. 105-33), established PPS for SNFs. 
Under PPS, all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital) related to services furnished to beneficiaries
covered under Part A, including certain Part B services, are paid a predetermined per diem
amount.  This amount is based on the medical condition and needs of the resident, as reflected in
the Resource Utilization Group (RUG) code assigned to that resident.  The BBA also required
consolidated billing for SNFs.  Under consolidated billing, all services provided by the SNF,
including those furnished under arrangements with an outside supplier, for a resident of a SNF in
a covered Part A stay are included in the SNF's Part A bill.  If a resident is <u>not</u> in a covered Part
A stay, under consolidated billing, the SNF still bills for all services furnished to the resident
(except for those services specifically excluded from consolidated billing).  However, the
implementation of consolidated billing with respect to services furnished to residents in a Part B
stay has been delayed indefinitely, and various ancillary services continue to be reimbursed
separately to outside suppliers until further notice.  <u>See</u> HCFA Program Memorandum (PM)
Transmittal No. AB-98-35 (July 1998); PM Transmittal No. AB-98-45 (August 1998); and PM
Transmittal No. AB-99-90 (Dec. 1999).
<p><a name="N_43_">43. </a>For example, the OIG has investigated suppliers of ancillary services that improperly
bill for an hour of therapy when only a few minutes were provided.  Similarly, vendors that
knowingly submit a claim for an expensive prosthetic device when the resident only received
non-covered adult diapers have been the subject of enforcement actions.  When consolidated
billing is implemented, vendors will not submit bills directly to Medicare for such services.  As
the entity submitting the claim, the nursing facility will need to have any certifications or orders
necessary to provide the service, as well as any required supporting documentation, to receive
payment.
<p><a name="N_44_">44. </a>Billing for medically unnecessary services, supplies and equipment involves seeking
reimbursement for a service that is not warranted by a resident's documented medical condition. 
<u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(1)(A) ("no payment may be made under part A or part B [of Medicare]
for any expenses incurred for items or services which . . . are not reasonable and necessary for the
diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of the malformed body
member").  At the same time, nursing facilities are required to provide the services necessary to
attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being of each
resident.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(b)(2) and 1396r(b)(2).  In order to meet these obligations,
nursing homes should formulate policies and procedures that include periodic clinical reviews,
both prior and subsequent to billing for services, as a means of verifying that patients receive
appropriate services. 

<p>	In the Special Fraud Alert "Fraud and Abuse in the Provision of Services in Nursing
Facilities" (June 1996), the OIG identified several types of fraudulent arrangements through
which health care providers inappropriately billed Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary or
non-rendered items and services.  Under PPS, the provision of unnecessary services may take a
different form.  As discussed below, manipulation of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) to fit a
resident into a higher RUG can result in the provision of medically unnecessary services.  In
addition, a nursing facility may not enter into arrangements with providers of ancillary services
through which the facility overutilizes services reimbursed under Part B in return for an offset in
the cost of items or services covered under Part A.
<p><a name="N_45_">45. </a>In order for a SNF stay to be covered by Medicare, the beneficiary must have a
preceding three-day inpatient hospital stay.  Observational stays and emergency room care do not
qualify towards the 3-day hospital stay requirement.  In addition, Medicare Part A benefits in
skilled nursing facilities are limited to beneficiaries who require skilled services rendered by
technical or professional personnel in a skilled nursing setting.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 409.31.   Knowingly
misrepresenting the nature or level of services provided to a Medicare beneficiary to circumvent
the program's limitation is fraudulent.  
<p><a name="N_46_">46. </a>Duplicate billing occurs when the nursing facility bills for the same item or service
more than once or when a vendor bills the Federal health care program for an item or service also
billed by the facility.  Although duplicate billing can occur due to simple error, the knowing
submission of duplicate claims -- which is sometimes evidenced by systematic or repeated
double billing -- can create liability under criminal, civil, or administrative law. A recent OIG
survey of SNF PPS claims found a significant number of erroneous payments made by the
Medicare carrier for services for which payments were already included in the SNF's PPS
payment.  As Medicare continues the implementation of consolidated billing, facilities should
modify all agreements with vendors to require that the vendor bill the facility for those services
covered under consolidated billing requirements and not submit bills directly to Medicare for
such services.  Communication mechanisms also should be established to ensure duplicative
billings do not occur.  For example, a facility may wish to flag a referral to an outpatient provider
as a "PPS resident" and inform the provider that the nursing home will be responsible for billing
Medicare for the ancillary services.
<p><a name="N_47_">47. </a>A credit balance is an excess payment made to a health care provider as a result of
patient billing or claims processing error.  Nursing facilities should institute procedures to
provide for the timely identification, accurate reporting and repayment of credit balances.  In
addition, the provider should promptly repay if a resident is also entitled to a credit.  <u>See</u> OIG
reports OEI-07-09-00910 "Medicare Credit Balances in Skilled Nursing Facility Patient
Accounts" and OEI-07-09-00911 "Medicaid Credit Balances in Skilled Nursing Facility Patient
Accounts," in which the OIG found that skilled nursing facilities were not accurately or
completely adjusting and reporting credit balance amounts due to the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.  Significantly, the intentional concealment of a known overpayment may expose a
provider to criminal sanctions (<u>see</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3)), and civil liability under the False
Claims Act. 
<p><a name="N_48_">48. </a>Billing for services or items not ordered involves seeking reimbursement for services
provided but not ordered by the treating physician or other authorized person.  
<p><a name="N_49_">49. </a><u>See</u> discussion on quality of care standards in nursing facilities in section II.B.2.a above
and the accompanying notes.  Although the OIG is not suggesting that each and every survey
citation or failure to meet the applicable standard of care is a <u>per</u> <u>se</u> violation of the False Claims
Act (or a criminal, other civil, or administrative violation), knowingly billing for nonexistent <strike></strike>or
substandard care, items, or services may give rise to criminal, civil, and/or administrative
liability.<strike></strike>
<p><a name="N_50_">50. </a>Upcoding involves the selection of a billing code that is not the most appropriate
descriptor of the service or condition, in order to maximize reimbursement.  Under PPS,
upcoding may take the form of "RUG creep."<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>
<p><a name="N_51_">51. </a>"RUG creep" occurs when a nursing facility mischaracterizes the
condition and needs of a resident in order to get a higher RUG rate and greater per
diem reimbursement.  The OIG is concerned that nursing facilities may select
higher RUG categories than necessary to maximize income, although not always
necessarily for the well-being of the patient. 

<p><a name="N_52_">52. </a>A related risk area involves bill splitting schemes.  This billing abuse usually takes the
form of manipulating the billing for procedures to create the appearance that the services were
rendered over a period of days when, in fact, all treatment occurred during one visit.
<p><a name="N_53_">53. </a>The OIG has investigated a number of cases where signatures were forged, either to
fabricate evidence that a physician ordered equipment or services or to create a paper trail in
support of items or services that were never provided.  
<p><a name="N_54_">54. </a>Nursing homes are required to submit various reports to Federal and State agencies in
connection with facility operations and to receive reimbursement for the care provided to
program beneficiaries.  Because program payments are in part based on self-reported operating
costs, providers must implement procedures to ensure that these reports are prepared as
accurately as possible.  This should include measures to ensure that adequate documentation
exists to support information provided in the report, non-allowable costs are appropriately
identified and removed, and related party transactions are treated consistent with program
requirements.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR part 413.  If the provider intends to claim costs in non-conformity
with program rules, those items should be flagged in a letter accompanying the cost report.  

<p>	Prior enforcement actions involving nursing home cost reports have focused on nursing
facilities that claimed salary expenses for employees who did not exist, inflated the number of
residents served, included non-reimbursable costs with nursing home-related expenses,
inappropriately shifted costs to cost centers that were below the reimbursement cap, and shifted
non-Medicare related costs to Medicare cost centers. 
<p><a name="N_55_">55. </a>The CIA imposes reporting requirements, independent audits, and other procedures on
providers who have demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to independently adopt these
measures.  It is clearly in a provider's best interest to avoid the implementation of a CIA by
instituting its own prevention, detection, and disclosure mechanisms.
<p><a name="N_56_">56. </a>42 CFR 483.13(c)(1).
<p><a name="N_57_">57. </a>In OIG report A-12-97-0003 "Safeguarding Long Term Care Residents," it was noted
that, although no Federal requirement exists for criminal background checks on nursing home
staff, 33 States currently require that such checks occur.  However, there appears to be great
diversity in the way States identify, investigate, and report suspected abuse of nursing home
residents. 
<p><a name="N_58_">58. </a>The effect of an OIG exclusion from Federal health care programs is that no Federal
health care program payment may be made for any items or services: (1) furnished by an
excluded individual or entity; or (2) directed or prescribed by an excluded physician.  <u>See</u> 42
CFR 1001.1901.  An excluded individual or entity that submits a claim for reimbursement to a
Federal health care program, or causes such a claim to be submitted, may be subject to a civil
money penalty of $10,000 for each item or service furnished during the period that the person or
entity was excluded.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(1)(D).  The individual or entity also may be
subject to treble damages for the amount claimed for each item or service.  <u>See</u> 42
U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a).  <u>See also</u> OIG Special Advisory Bulletin "The Effect of Exclusion From
Participation in Federal Health Care Programs" (September 1999). 
<p><a name="N_59_">59. </a>	Likewise, the facility should establish standards prohibiting the execution of contracts
with companies that recently have been convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or
that are listed by a Federal agency as debarred, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for participation
in Federal health care programs.  Prospective employees or contractors that have been officially
reinstated into the Medicare and Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for
employment upon proof of such reinstatement.  
<p><a name="N_60_">60. </a>Among the sources of information on prospective employees are the State registry of
nurses' aides, which provides a list of nurse aides that have successfully completed training and
competency evaluations and the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB).  The NPDB is a
database that contains information about physicians subject to medical malpractice payments,
sanctions by boards of medical examiners or State licensing boards, adverse clinical privilege
actions, and adverse professional society membership actions.  Health care entities can have
access to this database to seek information about their own medical or clinical staff, as well as
prospective employees or physician contractors.
<p><a name="N_61_">61. </a>The OIG "List of Excluded Individuals/Entities" provides information to health care

participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs.  This report, in both
an on-line searchable and downloadable database, can be located on the Internet at

listing of debarred contractors, "List of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement and
Nonprocurement Programs," at <em>http://epls.arnet.gov.</em>

<p>	The OIG sanction information is readily available to users in two formats on over 15,000
individuals and entities currently excluded from program participation through action taken by
the OIG.  The on-line searchable database allows users to obtain information regarding excluded
individuals and entities sorted by: (1) the legal bases for exclusions; (2) the types of individuals
and entities excluded by the OIG; and (3) the States where excluded individuals reside or entities
do business. 
<p><a name="N_62_">62. </a>The introduction of PPS and consolidated billing for Medicare Part B services means
that vendors and their subcontractors no longer submit bills directly to Medicare for their
services.  Instead, the nursing facility will be submitting consolidated bills for certain services
provided to residents.  Because of the new responsibilities that are imposed on nursing facilities
under these reimbursement schemes, the facility may be held responsible if it claims
reimbursement for items or services provided by a contractor that has been excluded.
<p><a name="N_63_">63. </a>The anti-kickback statute provides criminal penalties for individuals and entities that
knowingly offer, pay, solicit or receive bribes, kickbacks, or other remuneration in order to
induce business reimbursable by Federal health care programs.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b). 
Civil penalties and exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs may also
result from a violation of the prohibition.  <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a(a)(5) and 1320a-7(b)(7).

<p><a name="N_67_">67. </a>In the OIG Special Fraud Alert "Routine Waiver of Part B Co-payments/Deductibles"
(May 1991), the OIG describes several reasons why routine waivers of these cost-sharing
amounts pose abuse concerns.  The Alert sets forth the circumstances under which it may be
appropriate to waive these amounts. 
<p><a name="N_68_">68. </a>In the Special Fraud Alert "Fraud and Abuse in Nursing Home Arrangements with
Hospices" (March 1998), the OIG sets out the vulnerabilities in nursing home arrangements with
hospices.  The Alert provides several examples of questionable arrangements between hospices
and nursing homes that could inappropriately influence the referral of patients.  Examples
include the offering of free goods or goods at below fair market value to induce a nursing home
to refer patients to the hospice.  Other examples demonstrating vulnerability to fraud and abuse
include: (1) a hospice paying for room and board in excess of the amounts the nursing home
would normally charge or receive from Medicaid; (2) a hospice paying for additional services
that should be already included in the room and board payment; and (3) a hospice referring
patients to the nursing home in return for the nursing home's referral to the hospice.  While the
Special Fraud Alert focused on arrangements with hospices, nursing facilities should adopt
policies that prohibit similar questionable arrangements with all health care providers.
<p><a name="N_69_">69. </a>Providers should establish clear policies governing gift-giving, because such exchanges
may be viewed as inducements to influence business decisions.  Offering or providing any gift of
more than nominal value to any beneficiary may be done with the intent to inappropriately
influence health care decisions of the beneficiary or his or her family.  Similarly, accepting gifts,
hospitality, or entertainment from a source that is in a position to benefit from the referral of
business, raises concerns that the gift may influence the employee's independent judgment.  If the
provider decides to allow employees to accept gifts or other gratuities below a certain nominal
value or in an aggregate amount below an established amount per year, the provider should
consider requiring employees to report those gifts.
<p><a name="N_70_">70. </a><u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(d)(2), which prescribes criminal penalties for knowingly and
willfully charging for services provided to a Medicaid patient in excess of the rates established by
the State.  <u>See also</u> 42 CFR 483.12(d).
<p><a name="N_71_">71. </a>Under PPS, the payment rates represent payment in full, subject to applicable
coinsurance.  This includes payment for all costs associated with furnishing covered SNF
services to Medicare beneficiaries.  It is impermissible for a hospital to pay for SNF services if it
were to do so only for those residents who are Medicare beneficiaries discharged from that
hospital.  However, it would be permissible for a hospital to provide or pay for items or services
that are furnished to SNF residents generally, if such payments are made without regard to the
payment source for the individual resident.  In addition, a hospital and a SNF can enter into a
permissible bed reservation agreement.  <u>See</u> <u>Provider Reimbursement Manual</u>, Part I, section
2105.3. 
<p><a name="N_72_">72. </a>All physician contracts and agreements should be reviewed to avoid violation of the
anti-kickback, self-referral, and other relevant Federal and State laws.  The OIG has published
safe harbors that define practices not subject to the anti-kickback statute, because such
arrangements would be unlikely to result in fraud or abuse.  Failure to comply with a safe harbor
provision does not make an arrangement per se illegal.  Rather, the safe harbors set forth specific
conditions that, if fully met, would assure the entities involved of not being prosecuted or
sanctioned for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor.  One such safe harbor applies to
personal services contracts.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 1001.952(d). 
<p><a name="N_73_">73. </a><u>See</u> OIG Special Fraud Alert "Fraud and Abuse in the Provision of Medical Supplies to

are billed to Federal health care programs.  <u>See also</u> OIG Advisory Opinion 99-2 (February
1999).
<p><a name="N_74_">74. </a>In addition to raising concerns related to the anti-kickback statute, the unauthorized
disclosure of confidential records violates the resident's rights.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.10(e). 
<p><a name="N_75_">75. </a><u>See</u> OIG Special Fraud Alert "Joint Venture Arrangements" (August 1989); OIG
Special Fraud Alert "Fraud and Abuse in the Provision of Services in Nursing Facilities" (May
1996).
<p><a name="N_76_">76. </a>"Swapping" occurs when a supplier gives a nursing facility discounts on Medicare Part
A items and services in return for the referrals of Medicare Part B business.  With swapping,
there is a risk that suppliers may offer a SNF an excessively low price for items or services
reimbursed under PPS in return for the ability to service and bill nursing facility residents with
Part B coverage.  <u>See</u> OIG Advisory Opinion 99-2 (February 1999).
<p><a name="N_77_">77. </a>Medical record documentation should support the medical necessity of the services
provided as well as the level of service billed.
<p><a name="N_78_">78. </a>Among the materials useful in documenting the compliance program are employee
certifications relating to training and other compliance initiatives, copies of compliance training
materials, and hotline logs and any corresponding reports of investigation, outcomes, and
employee disciplinary actions.  In addition, the facility should keep all relevant correspondence
with carriers, fiscal intermediaries, private health insurers, HCFA, and State survey and
certification agencies.  
<p><a name="N_79_">79. </a>In addition to prohibiting the falsification and backdating of records, the provider
should have clear guidelines, consistent with applicable professional and legal standards, that set
out those individuals with authority to make entries in the medical record and the circumstances
when late entries may be made in a record.
<p><a name="N_80_">80. </a>For multi-facility organizations, the OIG encourages coordination with each facility
owned by the corporation through the use of a headquarter's compliance officer, communicating
with parallel positions or compliance liaison in each facility or regional office, as appropriate. 
<p><a name="N_81_">81. </a>	<sup>80</sup>The OIG believes it is not advisable for the compliance function to be subordinate to the
nursing facility's general counsel, or comptroller or similar financial officer.  Free-standing
compliance functions help to ensure independent and objective legal reviews and financial
analysis of the institution's compliance efforts and activities.  By separating the compliance
function from the key management positions of general counsel or chief financial officer (where
the size and structure of the nursing facility make this a feasible option), a system of checks and
balances is established to more effectively achieve the goals of the compliance program.
<p><a name="N_82_">82. </a><a name="Footnote"></a><u>See</u> note 59.
<p><a name="N_83_">83. </a>	<sup>82</sup><u>See</u> note 60.
<p><a name="N_84_">84. </a>The compliance officer may also have to ensure that the criminal backgrounds of
employees have been checked depending upon State requirements or nursing facility policy. 
<p><a name="N_85_">85. </a>There are many approaches the compliance officer may enlist to maintain the vitality of
the compliance program.  Periodic on-site visits of nursing facility operations, bulletins with
compliance updates and reminders, distribution of audiotapes or videotapes on different risk
areas, lectures at management and employee meetings, and circulation of recent health care
articles covering fraud and abuse are some examples of approaches the compliance officer can
employ. 
<p><a name="N_86_">86. </a>	<sup>85</sup>The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals with
varying responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, finance, audit, human resources,
and clinical management (<u>e.g.</u>, the medical director), as well as employees and managers of key
operating units.  The compliance officer should be an integral member of the committee as well. 
All committee members should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive experience within
their respective departments to implement any necessary changes to policies and procedures as
recommended by the committee.
<p><a name="N_87_">87. </a>A health care provider should expect its compliance committee members and
compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness, and an
approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the nursing facility. 
These interpersonal skills are as important as the professional experience of each member of the
compliance committee.
<p><a name="N_88_">88. </a>Specific compliance training should complement any "in-service" training sessions that
a nursing facility may regularly schedule to provide an ongoing program for the training of
employees as required by the Medicare program. 
<p><a name="N_89_">89. </a>	<sup>88</sup>Some publications, such as OIG's Special Fraud Alerts, audit and inspection reports,
and advisory opinions are readily available from the OIG and can provide a basis for educational
courses and programs for appropriate nursing facility employees.
<p><a name="N_90_">90. </a>Significant variations in the functions and responsibilities of different departments or
groups may create the need for training materials that are tailored to compliance concerns
associated with particular operations and duties. 
<p><a name="N_91_">91. </a>Certain positions, such as those that involve billing, coding and the submission of
reimbursement data, create greater organizational legal exposure, and therefore require
specialized training.  Those hired to treat residents should undergo specialized training in
residents' rights.
<p><a name="N_92_">92. </a>Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and employee
comprehension of the nursing facility's policies and procedures.
<p><a name="N_93_">93. </a>In addition, where feasible, the OIG recommends that a nursing facility give vendors
and outside contractors the opportunity to participate in the nursing facility's compliance training
and educational programs.  Such training is particularly important for facilities that rely on
agencies to provide temporary direct care staff.  The introduction of consolidated billing gives
added importance to educating vendors about the facility's compliance policies and procedures.
<p><a name="N_94_">94. </a>Currently, the OIG is monitoring a significant number of corporate integrity agreements
that require many of these training elements.  The OIG usually requires a minimum of one to
three hours annually for basic training in compliance areas.  Additional training is required for
specialty fields such as claims development and billing.
<p><a name="N_95_">95. </a>	<sup>94</sup> In some cases, employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u> <u>tam
</u>provisions out of frustration because of the company's failure to take action when the employee
brought a questionable, fraudulent, or abusive situation to the attention of senior corporate
officials.  Whistle blowers must be protected against retaliation, a concept embodied in the
provisions of the False Claims Act.  <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 3730(h).
<p><a name="N_96_">96. </a>Nursing facilities also may wish to consider rewarding employees for appropriate use of
established reporting systems.  After all, the employee who identifies and helps stop an abusive
practice can benefit the corporation as much as one who identifies cost-savings measures or
increases corporate revenues.
<p><a name="N_97_">97. </a>The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a smaller nursing facility
to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls about compliance issues.  These
companies may want to explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>, outsourcing the hotline or establishing
a written method of confidential disclosure.
<p><a name="N_98_">98. </a>In addition, an effective employee exit interview program could be designed to solicit
information from departing employees regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations
of nursing facility policy and procedures. 
<p><a name="N_99_">99. </a>42 CFR 483.10(b)(7)(iii).  Nursing facilities also should post in a prominent area the
HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800-HHS-TIPS).
<p><a name="N_100_">100. </a>To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the nursing facility should create
an intake form for all compliance issues identified through reporting mechanisms.  The form
could include information concerning the date that the potential problem was reported, the results
of the internal investigation, and, as appropriate, the corrective action implemented, the
disciplinary measures imposed, and any identified overpayments returned. 
<p><a name="N_101_">101. </a>Information obtained over the hotline may provide valuable insight into management
practices and operations, whether reported problems are actual or perceived.
<p><a name="N_102_">102. </a>Even when a nursing facility or group of facilities is owned by a larger corporate entity,
the regular auditing and monitoring of the compliance activities of an individual facility must be
a key feature in any annual review.  Appropriate reports on audit findings should be periodically
provided and explained to a parent organization's senior staff and officers.
<p><a name="N_103_">103. </a><u>See also</u> section II.B.2.
<p><a name="N_104_">104. </a>	<sup>103</sup>The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a nursing
facility, the compliance officer, with the assistance of department managers, should take a
"snapshot" of their operations from a compliance perspective.  This assessment can be
undertaken by outside consultants or internal staff, provided they have knowledge of health care
program requirements.  This "snapshot" can serve as a baseline for the compliance officer and
other managers to judge the nursing facility's progress in reducing potential areas of
vulnerability. 
<p><a name="N_105_">105. </a><u>See</u> <u>Provider Reimbursement Manual</u> Part I, section 2836(D)(3), which sets out the
MDS correction policy.
<p><a name="N_106_">106. </a>In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section II.H.2, below, reports of fraud
or systemic problems also should be made to the appropriate governmental authority.
<p><a name="N_107_">107. </a>Examples of CIA audit protocols can be obtained from the OIG by submitting a request
pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. The OIG recently has entered into CIAs with a
number of nursing home providers that may be of particular relevance.  In addition, the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has issued a detailed guide for conducting an
independent assessment of a health care provider's conformance to a CIA.  <u>See</u> AICPA
Statement of Position 99-1, "Guidance to Practitioners in Conducting and Reporting on an
Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement to Assist in Evaluating Compliance with a Corporate
Integrity Agreement" (May 1999).
<p><a name="N_108_">108. </a>The OIG recognizes that nursing facilities that have limited resources may not be able
to use internal reviewers who are not part of line management or hire outside reviewers.
<p><a name="N_109_">109. </a>Instances of noncompliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  The
existence or amount of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely determinative of
whether the conduct should be investigated and reported to governmental authorities.  In fact,
there may be instances where there is no readily identifiable monetary loss, but corrective actions
are still necessary to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries, <u>e.g.</u>,
where failure to comply with the facility's policies and procedures results in inadequate or
inappropriate care being furnished to a facility resident.
<p><a name="N_110_">110. </a>The nursing facility may seek advice from its in-house counsel or an outside law firm
to determine the extent of the facility's liability and to plan the appropriate course of action.
<p><a name="N_111_">111. </a>	<sup>110</sup>Nursing facilities are required to immediately report all alleged incidents of
mistreatment, neglect, abuse (including injuries of unknown source), and misappropriation of
resident property to both the facility administrator and other officials in accordance with State
law.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 483.13(c)(2).  This is the appropriate channel for reporting quality of care
issues.  The OIG also has established a provider self-disclosure protocol that encourages
providers voluntarily to report suspected fraud.  The concept of voluntary self-disclosure is
premised on a recognition that the Government alone cannot protect the integrity of Medicare
and other Federal health care programs.  Health care providers must be willing to police
themselves, correct underlying problems, and work with the Government to resolve these
matters.  The self-disclosure protocol can be located on the OIG's web site at: 
<em>http://www.hhs.gov/oig</em>.
<p><a name="N_112_">112. </a>The parameters of a claims review subject to an internal investigation will depend on
the circumstances surrounding the issues identified.  By limiting the scope of an internal audit to
current billing, a nursing facility may fail to discover major problems and deficiencies in
operations, and may subject itself to liability.
<p><a name="N_113_">113. </a>Appropriate Federal and State authorities include the OIG, the Criminal and Civil
Divisions of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney in relevant districts, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and the other investigative arms for the agencies administering the affected
Federal or State health care programs, such as the State Survey Agency, the State Medicaid Fraud
Control Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs,
and the Office of Personnel Management (which administers the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program).  State law may further specify types of misconduct and to whom a facility
must report its findings.  <u>See</u> note 110.
<p><a name="N_114_">114. </a>In contrast, to qualify for the "not less than double damages" provision of the False
Claims Act, the provider must provide the report to the Government within 30 days after the date
when the provider first obtained the information.  <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 3729(a).
<p><a name="N_115_">115. </a>	<sup>114</sup>Some violations may be so serious that they warrant immediate notification to
governmental authorities prior to, or simultaneous with, commencing an internal investigation. 
By way of example, the OIG believes a provider should report misconduct that: (1) is a clear
violation of OIG administrative authorities, or civil or criminal fraud laws; (2) has a significant
adverse effect on the quality of care provided to residents (in addition to any other legal
obligations regarding quality of care); or (3) indicates evidence of a systemic failure to comply
with applicable laws or an existing corporate integrity agreement, regardless of the financial
impact on Federal health care programs. 
<p><a name="N_116_">116. </a>	<sup>115</sup>The OIG has published criteria setting forth those factors that the OIG takes into
consideration in determining whether it is appropriate to exclude a health care provider from
program participation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7) for violations of various fraud and
abuse laws.  <u>See</u> 62 FR 67392 (December 24, 1997).
<p><a name="N_117_">117. </a>	<sup>116</sup>A nursing facility should consult with its Medicare fiscal intermediary (FI) and the
appropriate sections of the Provider Reimbursement Manual for additional guidance regarding
refunds under Medicare Part A.  <u>See</u> note 104.  The FI may require certain information (<u>e.g.</u>,
alleged violation or issue causing overpayment, description of the internal investigative process
with methodologies used to determine any overpayments, and corrective actions taken, etc.) to be
submitted with the return of any overpayments, and that such repayment information be
submitted to a specific department or individual.  When appropriate, interest may be assessed on
the overpayment.  <u>See</u> 42 CFR 405.378. 
<p><a name="N_118_">118. </a><u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. 669.
<p><a name="N_119_">119. </a>Evaluation may be accomplished through techniques 
  such as employee surveys, management assessments, and periodic review of benchmarks 
  established for audits, investigations, disciplinary action, overpayments, and 
  employee feedback. The nursing facility should evaluate all elements of its 
  compliance program, including policies, training, practices, and compliance 
  personnel. <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/bottom.lbi" -->
