<p align="center"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>

<p>In its ongoing effort to work collaboratively with the health care industry to achieve
the mutual goals of quality health care and the elimination of fraud, waste and abuse, the
Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
encourages voluntarily developed and implemented compliance programs for the health care
industry. Fundamentally, compliance efforts are designed to establish a culture within an
organization that promotes prevention, detection and resolution of instances of conduct
that do not conform to Federal and State law and Federal health care program requirements,
as well as the organization's ethical and business policies. In practice, the compliance
program should effectively articulate and demonstrate the organization's commitment to
legal and ethical conduct. </p>

<p>As a demonstration of the OIG's commitment to compliance, the OIG has issued
recommendations, in the form of compliance program guidances, that provide suggestions
regarding how specific segments of the industry can best implement compliance programs.<a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> As a result of the changing nature of the health care
delivery system and the growing trend toward reliance on the managed care industry in the
provision of health care in the Medicare context, the OIG believes it is appropriate to
issue a guidance focusing on Medicare+Choice organizations<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>offering
coordinated care plans<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (Medicare+Choice organizations).
The OIG formulated this guidance specifically for Medicare+Choice organizations because
these organizations are well-defined and are subject to a comprehensive regulatory
structure.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> In addition, Congress envisioned an important
role for Medicare+Choice organizations, demonstrated by the substantial amount of Federal
funds received by these organizations. </p>

<p>The OIG encourages Medicare+Choice organizations to read the guidance with the whole
organization in mind, applying the guidance to whatever departments or divisions,
including private-sector managed care areas, that are deemed appropriate by that
organization. Indeed, many of the suggestions in this guidance can be used by managed care
organizations that do not contract with HCFA to provide a Medicare+Choice plan. In
particular, entities that participate in other public health care programs, such as
Medicaid, may want to look to the general principles in this document to assist them in
developing compliance programs. </p>

<p>While the regulations implementing the Medicare+Choice program, or Part C, require a
Medicare+Choice organization to establish a compliance plan,<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>
the OIG's program guidance is voluntary and simply is intended to provide assistance for
Medicare+Choice organizations looking for additional direction in the development of
internal controls that promote adherence to applicable Federal and State law. The OIG
first provides its general views on the value and fundamental principles of
Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs, and then provides specific elements
that each Medicare+Choice organization should consider when developing and implementing an
effective compliance program. </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>BENEFITS OF A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG believes an effective compliance program provides a mechanism that brings the
public and private sectors together to reach mutual goals of reducing fraud and abuse,
improving operational quality, and ensuring the provision of high quality cost-effective
care. Attaining these goals benefits business, Government, individual citizens and
Medicare beneficiaries alike. In addition to fulfilling its legal duties to ensure that it
is not submitting false or inaccurate information to the Government or providing
substandard care to Medicare beneficiaries, a Medicare+Choice organization may gain
numerous additional benefits by implementing an effective compliance program. These
benefits may include: </p>

<p>o The formulation of effective internal controls to assure compliance with Federal
regulations and internal guidelines; </p>

<p>o Improved communication with and satisfaction of Medicare+Choice enrollees; </p>

<p>o The ability to more quickly and accurately react to employees' operational compliance
concerns and the capability to effectively target resources to address those concerns; </p>

<p>o A concrete demonstration to employees and the community at large of the
Medicare+Choice organization's strong commitment to honest and responsible corporate
conduct; </p>

<p>o The ability to obtain an accurate assessment of employee and contractor behavior
relating to fraud and abuse; </p>

<p>o Improved (clinical and non-clinical) quality of care and service; </p>

<p>o Improved assessment tools that could affect many or all of the Medicare+Choice
organization's divisions or departments; </p>

<p>o Increased likelihood of identification and prevention of unlawful and unethical
conduct; </p>

<p>o A centralized source for distributing information on health care statutes,
regulations and other program directives related to fraud and abuse; </p>

<p>o The creation or reinforcement of an environment that encourages employees to report
potential problems; </p>

<p>o Procedures that allow the prompt, thorough investigation of possible misconduct by
corporate officers, managers, employees and independent contractors; </p>

<p>o An improved relationship with the Center for Health Plans and Providers (CHPP) at
HCFA; and </p>

<p>o Early detection and reporting, minimizing the loss to the Government from false or
improper claims, and thereby reducing the Medicare+Choice organization's exposure to civil
damages and penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, such as program
exclusion.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Overall, the OIG believes that an effective compliance program is a sound business
investment that has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the
Medicare+Choice organization. It may also improve the Medicare+Choice organization's
financial structure by addressing not only fraud and abuse concerns, but efficiency and
productivity concerns in other operational areas. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes the implementation of an effective compliance program may not
entirely eliminate fraud, abuse and waste from an organization. However, a sincere effort
by a Medicare+Choice organization to comply with applicable Federal and State standards,
through the establishment of an effective compliance program, significantly reduces the
probability of unlawful or improper conduct. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>APPLICATION OF COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE</u></strong> </p>

<p>Before explaining the specific elements of a compliance program, it is important to
emphasize several aspects of this document: its voluntary nature, its applicability to
Medicare+Choice organizations, the collaborative nature by which it was developed, and its
evolving nature. </p>

<p>First, it should be re-emphasized that while the regulations implementing the
Medicare+Choice program, or Part C, require a Medicare+Choice organization to establish a
compliance plan, including specified elements,<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> this
program guidance is voluntary. Although this document presents basic procedural and
structural guidance for designing a compliance program, it is not in itself a compliance
program. Rather, it is a set of guidelines for consideration by a Medicare+Choice
organization interested in obtaining specific information on implementing a compliance
program. This guidance represents the OIG's suggestions on how a Medicare+Choice
organization can establish internal controls and monitor company conduct to correct and
prevent fraudulent activities. </p>

<p>It is critical for the Medicare+Choice organization to assess its own organization and
determine its needs with regard to compliance with applicable Federal and State statutes
and Federal health care program requirements. By no means should the contents of this
guidance be viewed as an exclusive discussion of the advisable components of a compliance
program. On the contrary, the OIG strongly encourages Medicare+Choice organizations to
develop and implement compliance components that uniquely address the individual
organization's risk areas. </p>

<p>Implementing a compliance program in a Medicare+Choice organization is a complicated
venture. There are significant variances and complexities among Medicare+Choice
organizations in terms of the type of services and the manner in which these services are
provided to the respective members. For example, some Medicare+Choice organizations cover
broad service areas, while others are focused on a particular geographic region.
Similarly, the range of benefits covered differ among plans, as does the size of the
network and the use of a varying number of provider contracting tiers to deliver services.
Clearly, these differences may give rise to different substantive policies to ensure
effective compliance. Furthermore, some Medicare+Choice organizations are relatively
small, while others are fully integrated and offer Medicare+Choice plans in a wide variety
of areas. Finally, the availability of resources for any one Medicare+Choice organization
can differ vastly. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding these differences, this guidance is pertinent for all Medicare+Choice
organizations, large or small, regardless of the type of services provided. The
applicability of the recommendations and guidelines provided in this document may depend
on the circumstances and resources of each particular Medicare+Choice organization.
However, regardless of the organization's size and structure, the OIG believes every
Medicare+Choice organization can and should strive to accomplish the objectives and major
principles underlying all of the compliance policies and procedures recommended within
this guidance. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the success of the compliance program guidance hinges on
thoughtful and practical comments from those individuals and organizations that will
utilize the tools set forth in this document. In a continuing effort to collaborate
closely with the private sector, the OIG solicited input and support from the public in
the development of this compliance program guidance.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
Further, we took into consideration previous OIG publications, such as Special Fraud
Alerts, the recent findings and recommendations in reports issued by OIG's Office of Audit
Services (OAS) and Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI),<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>comments
from HCFA, as well as the experience of past and recent fraud investigations related to
managed care organizations<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>conducted by OIG's Office of
Investigations (OI) and the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>As appropriate, this guidance may be modified and expanded as more information and
knowledge is obtained by the OIG, and as changes in the law, and in the rules, policies
and procedures of the Federal and State plans occur. New compliance practices may
eventually be incorporated into this guidance if the OIG discovers significant
enhancements to better ensure an effective compliance program. We recognize the
development and implementation of compliance programs in Medicare+Choice organizations
often raise sensitive and complex legal and managerial issues.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
However, the OIG wishes to offer what it believes is critical guidance for those who are
sincerely attempting to comply with the relevant health care statutes and regulations. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ELEMENTS</strong> </p>

<p>The elements discussed in this guidance are similar to those of the other OIG
Compliance Program Guidances<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and our corporate
integrity agreements.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> While these same elements are
required by HCFA in the Medicare+Choice regulations,<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>the
OIG reiterates that this guidance is not mandatory, but simply represents OIG's
recommendations on how the elements can be implemented.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Every effective compliance program must begin with a formal commitment<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
by the Medicare+Choice organization's governing body to include <u>all</u> of the
applicable elements listed below. A good faith and meaningful commitment on the part of
the Medicare+Choice organization's administration, especially the governing body and the
chief executive officer (CEO), will substantially contribute to the program's successful
implementation. It is incumbent upon an organization's officers and managers to provide
ethical leadership to the organization and to assure adequate systems and resources are in
place to facilitate and promote ethical and legal conduct. Employees, managers and the
Government will focus on the words and actions (including decisions made on resources
devoted to compliance) of an organization's leadership as a measure of the organization's
commitment to compliance. </p>

<p>Under Medicare+Choice, an organization may, by written contract, delegate any activity
required under or governed by the Medicare+Choice standards to another entity. However, an
organization entering into a Medicare contract remains entirely accountable to HCFA for
the performance of any delegated function.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> It is the
sole responsibility of the organization to ensure that the function is performed in
accordance with applicable standards. While the activity may be delegated, the oversight
responsibility remains with the Medicare+Choice organization. Each Medicare+Choice
organization should keep these requirements and responsibilities in mind as it develops
its compliance program. </p>

<p>These elements are based on the seven steps of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<a
href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> As required by the HCFA regulations, every
Medicare+Choice organization must implement all of the recommended elements and expand
upon them, as appropriate. At a minimum, comprehensive compliance programs should include
the following seven elements: </p>

<p>(1) The development and distribution of written standards of conduct, as well as
written policies and procedures, that promote the Medicare+Choice organization's
commitment to compliance and that address specific areas of potential fraud (<u>e.g.</u>,
the marketing process and utilization); </p>

<p>(2) The designation of a chief compliance officer and other appropriate bodies, <u>e.g.</u>,
a corporate compliance committee, charged with the responsibility and authority of
operating and monitoring the compliance program and who report directly to the CEO and the
governing body; </p>

<p>(3) The development and implementation of regular, effective education and training
programs for all affected employees; </p>

<p>(4) The development of effective lines of communication between the compliance officer
and all employees, including a process, such as a hotline, to receive complaints (and the
adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of complainants and to protect callers
from retaliation); </p>

<p>(5) The use of audits or other risk evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and
assist in the reduction of identified problem areas; </p>

<p>(6) The development of disciplinary mechanisms to consistently enforce standards and
the development of policies addressing dealings with sanctioned and other specified
individuals; and </p>

<p>(7) The development of policies to respond to detected offenses, to initiate corrective
action to prevent similar offenses, and to report to Government authorities when
appropriate. </p>

<p><strong>A. <u>WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</u></strong> </p>

<p>Every compliance program should require the development and distribution of written
compliance policies, standards and practices that identify specific areas of risk and
vulnerability to the Medicare+Choice organization. These policies should be developed by
the appropriate operational officials within the Medicare+Choice organization, with
appropriate review and oversight by the compliance officer and compliance committee. The
OIG recommends that these policies be made available to all individuals who are affected
by the particular risk or policy area at issue. Such individuals would include, for
example, Medicare+Choice employees whose duties touch upon a particular risk or policy
area, as well as agents and independent contractors with whom the organization has
contracted to perform delegated activities, which touch upon a particular risk or policy
area.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> The OIG also recommends that Medicare+Choice
organizations provide, upon request, all contractors with a summary of the standards of
conduct and the number of the hotline. The distribution of these materials could be
accomplished via hard copy or via electronic means. </p>

<p><strong>1. Standards of Conduct</strong> </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should develop standards of conduct for all affected
employees that include a clearly delineated commitment to compliance by the organization's
senior management and its divisions. To help communicate a strong and explicit
organizational commitment to compliance goals and standards, the Medicare+Choice
organization's governing body, CEO, chief operating officer (COO), general counsel, chief
financial officer (CFO) and other senior officials should be directly involved in the
development of standards of conduct. </p>

<p>The standards should function in the same fashion as a constitution, <u>i.e.</u>, as a
foundational document that details the fundamental principles, values and framework for
action within an organization, as well as the organization's mission and goals. The
standards should also articulate the Medicare+Choice organization's commitment to comply
with all Federal and State laws and regulations, with an emphasis on preventing fraud and
abuse, and include the ramifications of failure to comply with these standards. The
standards should not only address compliance with statutes and regulations, but should
also set forth broad principles that guide employees in conducting business professionally
and properly. In short, the standards should promote integrity, support objectivity and
foster trust. Furthermore, a Medicare+Choice organization's standards of conduct should
reflect a commitment to high quality health care delivery, as evidenced by its conduct of
on-going performance assessment, improved outcomes of care and respect for the rights of
Medicare+Choice enrollees. </p>

<p><strong>2. Written Policies</strong> <strong>for Risk Areas</strong> </p>

<p>As part of its commitment to compliance, Medicare+Choice organizations should establish
a comprehensive set of written policies addressing all applicable statutes, rules and
program instructions that apply to each function or department of that Medicare+Choice
organization.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>The policies should address specific
areas of concern, such as marketing practices and data collection and submission
processes. In contrast to the standards of conduct, which are designed to be a clear and
concise collection of fundamental standards, the written policies should articulate
specific procedures personnel should follow when performing their duties.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The regulations and operational policies issued by HCFA that implement the
Medicare+Choice program are very comprehensive and, as required by HCFA, serve as the
basis for the policies and procedures of a Medicare+Choice organization.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
The legal, policy and contractual requirements that organizations must meet and perform as
a Medicare+Choice organization are articulated in documentation promulgated by HCFA and
other Federal agencies and should be considered de facto risk areas. Included among these
risk areas are: (1) the election process; (2) benefits and beneficiary protections; (3)
quality assessment and performance improvement; (4) cost sharing; (5) solvency, licensure
and other state regulatory issues; (6) claims processing; and (7) appeals and grievance
procedures. </p>

<p>To determine the additional policies and procedures that are needed for a given
Medicare+Choice organization (and which policies may need particular attention), the OIG
recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations conduct a comprehensive self-administered
risk analysis or contract for an independent risk analysis by experienced health care
consulting professionals. This risk analysis could include surveys and statistical
analysis specifically tailored to the organization's beneficiary population, provider pool
and organizational structure and should identify and rank the various compliance and
business risks the company may experience in its daily operations.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
A Medicare+Choice organization's prior history of noncompliance with applicable statutes,
regulations and Federal health care program requirements, or the failure to report such
non-compliance, may indicate additional types of risk areas where the organization may be
vulnerable and may require necessary policy measures to prevent avoidable recurrence.<a
href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The fact that Medicare+Choice organizations may be both providers and insurers of
health care increases the number and type of risk areas to which a Medicare+Choice
organization must be attuned, as well as the type of auditing and monitoring procedures
that must be implemented, in the development of its compliance efforts. For example, there
are a variety of substantially different operational areas within the structure of a
Medicare+Choice organization such as marketing, health services delivery and finances that
could require different types of policies. </p>

<p>Given the detailed nature of the HCFA rules and regulations, we have not attempted in
this document to identify each and every policy that should be established by a
Medicare+Choice organization. Rather, based on a review of OIG audits, investigations and
evaluations, we have identified the following areas of particular concern to OIG that the
Medicare+Choice organization should include in its written policies and procedures:<a
href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Marketing materials and personnel; </p>

<p>o Selective marketing and enrollment; </p>

<p>o Disenrollment; </p>

<p>o Underutilization and quality of care; </p>

<p>o Data collection and submission processes; </p>

<p>o Anti-kickback statute and other inducements; and </p>

<p>o Emergency services. </p>

<p>The following sections provide specific guidance regarding the risk areas identified
above. </p>

<p><strong>a. Marketing Materials and Personnel</strong> </p>

<p>While each Medicare+Choice organization must comply with all of HCFA's detailed
requirements relating to marketing their plans,<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> OIG is
particularly concerned that organizations have policies regarding: (1) the completeness
and accuracy of the marketing materials; and (2) marketing personnel. </p>

<p>Accurate and useful information is crucial to the success of the Medicare+Choice
program. OIG is concerned that Medicare+Choice organizations correctly and completely
describe plan information in marketing materials or other materials distributed to
individuals prior to and following enrollment. Medicare+Choice organizations that
misrepresent or falsify information submitted to HCFA, individuals or entities are subject
to civil monetary penalties (CMPs) or other intermediate sanctions.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The submission of inaccurate or misleading information is of particular concern to OIG.
Medicare+Choice organizations should be aware that the fact that materials have been
approved by HCFA does not absolve them from potential liability for misrepresenting or
falsifying information.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> </p>

<p>HCFA considers marketing materials to include any informational materials targeted to
Medicare beneficiaries. Marketing materials go beyond the public's general conception of
marketing materials and include general circulation brochures, leaflets, newspapers,
magazines, television, radio, billboards, yellow pages, the Internet, slides and charts,
and leaflets for distribution by providers. Such materials also include membership
communication materials such as membership rules, subscriber agreements, or confirmation
of enrollment.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> Accordingly, Medicare+Choice
organizations should carefully scrutinize all of these materials for completeness,
accuracy and compliance with HCFA rules, regulations and policy letters. </p>

<p>In verifying that marketing materials meet all HCFA requirements, Medicare+Choice
organizations should ensure that the appropriate materials contain an adequate description
of enrollee rights, procedures for accessing basic benefits and services, and a clear
explanation of the appeal and grievance process.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> Of
particular concern to HCFA and OIG is that the concept of &quot;lock-in&quot; is clearly
explained in all marketing material. Many Medicare beneficiaries are unfamiliar with the
notion that managed care may limit their health care provider choices. Describing the
process of selecting a primary care physician and the limitations that this places on a
Medicare+Choice enrollee's choice of provider will reduce the unmet expectations of
Medicare beneficiaries. </p>

<p>Another important concept to include in the marketing materials is that the beneficiary
may be terminated from enrollment in the plan due to the decision of the Medicare+Choice
organization not to renew its contract with HCFA, or due to HCFA's refusal to renew the
contract.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a> This termination can affect the enrollee's
eligibility for supplemental insurance and other benefits. </p>

<p>Second, in light of the critical role that marketing personnel play in representing the
plan to Medicare enrollees, the Medicare+Choice organization must take all appropriate
steps to ensure that marketing personnel are presenting clear, complete and accurate
information to potential enrollees. To that end, the OIG encourages Medicare+Choice
organizations to employ their own marketing personnel, as opposed to contracting these
responsibilities to outside entities.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> This provides
the Medicare+Choice organization the necessary control to ensure that these individuals
meet all HCFA guidelines. Similarly, it safeguards Medicare beneficiaries from practices
that could greatly affect the access to health care to which they are entitled and their
ability to acquire accurate and complete information regarding their health care options. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should also be aware that the OIG and HCFA strongly
discourage the use of physicians as marketing agents for several reasons: (1) when a
physician acts outside his or her traditional role as care provider, the physician's
patients may be confused as to when the physician is acting as an agent of the plan, and
when the physician is acting in his or her role as a fiduciary to act in the best
interests of the patient; (2) a physician's knowledge of a patient's health status
increases the potential for discriminating in favor of Medicare beneficiaries with
positive health status when acting as a marketing agent; (3) physicians may not be fully
aware of membership plan benefits and costs; and (4) physicians may not be the best source
of membership information for their patients.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a><strong> </strong>Therefore,
the organization should develop policies to ensure that any provider promotional
activities are conducted in accordance with HCFA guidelines (which allow, <u>e.g.</u>, the
distribution of health plan brochures (exclusive of applications) at a health fair or in
their own offices).<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>b. Selective Marketing and Enrollment</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG is very concerned about the practice known as &quot;cherry-picking,&quot; or
selective marketing,<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> in which Medicare+Choice
organizations discriminate in the marketing and enrollment process based upon an
enrollee's degree of risk for costly or prolonged treatment.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>Except
for individuals who have been medically determined to have end-stage renal disease, a
Medicare+Choice organization may not deny, limit or condition the coverage or furnishing
of benefits to individuals eligible to enroll in a Medicare+Choice plan offered by the
organization on the basis of any factor that is related to health status, including, but
not limited to, the following: (1) medical condition (including mental illness); (2)
claims experience; (3) receipt of health care; (4) medical history; (5) genetic
information; (6) evidence of insurability; and (7) disability.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
Engaging in practices that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or
discouraging enrollment by eligible individuals whose medical condition or history
indicates the need for substantial future medical services subjects the Medicare+Choice
organization to a CMP or other sanction, such as suspension of enrollment or suspension of
payment.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Certain types of practices clearly fall into the category of cherry-picking and
Medicare+Choice organizations should implement policies to prohibit and prevent such
practices. For example, organizations should generally prohibit employees from conducting
medical screening, <u>i.e.</u>, asking the beneficiary medical questions prior to
enrollment.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> In a 1996 survey, the OIG found that such
screening for health status at application was reported by 18 percent of beneficiaries.
While this represented a reduction from the 1993 level of 43 percent, it still represents
a potentially serious problem.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Another way in which Medicare+Choice organizations may inappropriately target healthier
beneficiaries is by primarily marketing their plans in places where healthy enrollees are
more likely to be present, such as at health and exercise clubs, or in areas that are
difficult to access for people with disabilities (<u>e.g.</u>, upper floors of buildings
that do not have elevators).<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a> Similarly, organizations
may inappropriately provide inducements to potential enrollees in a way that would
encourage younger, healthier beneficiaries to enroll in the plan. For example, the
offering of free gym memberships or kayaking or other sporting lessons would appeal to a
healthy class of enrollees and discriminate against those who would not be interested in
such activities.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> If a Medicare+Choice organization
intends to offer such items as a Medicare+Choice benefit, the item must meet the
definitional requirements of a bona fide benefit. The item must be: (1) related to health
care; and (2) costed out in the Medicare+Choice organization's Adjusted Community Rate.
Any such items that do not meet these requirements are not valid Medicare+Choice benefits
and must be considered &quot;value added services&quot; (VAS) subject to all the
limitations associated with VAS. </p>

<p>Other examples of cherry-picking would be: (1) attempts to give enrollment priority to
newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries (who are theoretically younger and healthier), other
than as set forth in the regulations;<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a> (2) the tracking
of costs incurred by enrollees who were enrolled in different settings (<u>e.g.</u>, at
the health fair, or at a health club), which could be used to target healthier enrollees
in the future; or (3) re-enrollment campaigns targeting past plan subscribers who had low
medical costs. There are many other subtle ways in which a Medicare+Choice organization
may try to enroll healthy patient populations in a discriminatory manner (<u>i.e.</u>, not
making similar attempts to enroll less healthy beneficiaries) and the organization should
implement policies actively to prevent such practices. </p>

<p><strong>c. Disenrollment</strong> </p>

<p>In general, Medicare+Choice organizations are prohibited from disenrolling, or
requesting or encouraging (either by action or inaction) an individual to disenroll from
any plan it offers.<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> If a Medicare+Choice organization
acts to expel or refuses to reenroll an individual in violation of the statute, a civil
monetary penalty or other sanction can be imposed on the organization.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
OIG is particularly concerned about disenrollment in light of its recent review, which
revealed that there was a problem with disenrollment of beneficiaries just prior to
receiving expensive inpatient services.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In this review, OIG found that Medicare paid for inpatient hospital services amounting
to $224 million in fee-for-service (FFS) payments within three months of beneficiaries'
disenrollment from six risk plans during 1991 through 1996. Had these beneficiaries not
disenrolled, Medicare would have paid the HMOs $20 million in monthly capitation payments.
Had the beneficiaries remained in the HMOs, Medicare would have saved $204 million in
expenditures. Included in the Medicare FFS payments were $41 million for beneficiaries who
disenrolled, had FFS procedures performed, and then reenrolled into another or the same
managed care plan. </p>

<p>While this study did not identify the reasons for the disenrollment as part of this
review, one partial explanation of the review could be that some managed care plans or
their medical personnel may be encouraging sicker beneficiaries to disenroll as a way to
avert their own costs at a high cost to the Medicare system. </p>

<p>Each Medicare+Choice organization must implement policies to ensure that inappropriate
disenrollment does not occur.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> Such policies should
include clarification of when it is appropriate for medical personnel to discuss the
concept of disenrollment. Generally speaking, OIG believes it would be inappropriate for
medical personnel <u>to initiate discussion</u> of disenrollment or <u>to promote
disenrollment</u> (when the topic is initiated by the enrollee), except in the rare
circumstance where the Medicare+Choice organization cannot or does not provide the covered
medical items or services needed by the patient. </p>

<p><strong>d. Underutilization and Quality of Care</strong> </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations must ensure that all covered services are available and
accessible to all enrollees.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> OIG views the
inappropriate withholding or delay of services, known as underutilization or
&quot;stinting,&quot; as a serious issue.<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a> Examples of
practices that can lead to underutilization and poor quality include the failure to employ
or contract with sufficient institutional and individual providers to accommodate all
enrollees, the failure to provide geographically reachable services to enrollees, the
delay in approving or failure to approve referrals for covered services, the establishment
of utilization review procedures that are so burdensome that an enrollee could not
reasonably be expected to fulfill the requirements and the categorical denial of payment
of claims.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a> </p>

<p>There are a wide variety of policies that a Medicare+Choice organization should
implement to be sure it is providing all medically necessary services to its enrollees.
The regulations and guidelines that implement the Medicare+Choice program contain numerous
provisions that deal with this issue. While we have not attempted to develop a
comprehensive list in this document, we would like to highlight three types of policies
that Medicare+Choice organizations should develop that may help address underutilization
and quality of care. </p>

<p>First, Medicare+Choice organizations should have policies that prohibit interference
with health care professionals' advice to enrollees. Also known as the &quot;gag
rule,&quot; this prohibition extends to advice regarding the patient's health status,
medical care, and treatment options, the risks, benefits and consequences of treatment or
non-treatment, or the opportunity for the individual to refuse treatment and to express
preferences about future treatment options.<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a> Failure to
comply with this requirement can lead to sanctions.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Second, Medicare+Choice organizations should be sure, to they extent that they utilize
physician incentive plans (PIPs) in their payment arrangements with individual physicians
or physician groups, that they comply with all applicable regulations and that such
payment arrangements are fully disclosed to HCFA as required by regulation. PIPs raise
utilization concerns because they are defined as &quot;any compensation arrangement to pay
a physician or physician group that may directly or indirectly have the effect of reducing
or limiting services provided to any plan enrollees.&quot;<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>
Any PIP operated by a Medicare+Choice organization must comply with the following
requirements. First, it may make no payments to physicians (such as offerings of monetary
value, including, but not limited to, stock options or waivers of debt<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>)
to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished to any particular enrollee.
Second, if the PIP puts a physician or physician group at &quot;substantial financial
risk&quot;<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a> for referral services, the Medicare+Choice
organization must: (1) survey current and previously enrolled members to assess access to,
and satisfaction with, the quality of services; and (2) assure that there is adequate and
appropriate stop-loss protection.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> Finally,
Medicare+Choice organizations must disclose to HCFA certain information regarding their
PIPs. These disclosure requirements apply to direct contracting arrangements, as well as
subcontracting arrangements.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Finally, the OIG is aware of cases in which beneficiaries have received covered services
from individuals that were not appropriately licensed. Given the serious quality of care
implications of this type of practice, the OIG is particularly concerned that
Medicare+Choice organizations have procedures for the selection of providers, including
criteria for the credentialing of providers. This process should include an application,
verification of information and a site visit, where applicable.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>
The information that must be verified includes that the individual has a valid license to
practice, clinical privileges in good standing and appropriate educational qualifications.
</p>

<p><strong>e. Data Collection and Submission Processes</strong> </p>

<p>The regulations implementing the Medicare+Choice program contain numerous requirements
relating to the data collection and submission process, ranging from a requirement for an
effective system for receiving, controlling and processing election forms<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>
to requirements for the timely submission of disenrollment notices.<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
These requirements cover the gamut of requirements with which a Medicare+Choice
organization must comply and are too detailed to enumerate in this document.
Medicare+Choice organizations should establish a policy that all required submissions to
HCFA be accurate, timely and complete and that all appropriate reporting requirements are
met.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a> </p>

<p>OIG is particularly concerned that Medicare+Choice organizations submit accurate data
when that information determines the amount of payment received from HCFA. The regulations
require that when a Medicare+Choice organization requests payment under the contract, the
CEO or CFO must certify the accuracy, completeness and truthfulness of relevant data,
including enrollment data, encounter data and information provided as part of an adjusted
community rate (ACR) proposal.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> When a Medicare+Choice
organization submits this type of data to HCFA, it is making a &quot;claim&quot; for
capitation payment in the amount dictated by the data submitted, or in the case of the ACR
submission, a &quot;claim&quot; to retain the portion of the capitation amount that is
under the average payment rate, rather than providing additional benefits. When a
Medicare+Choice organization is claiming payment (or the right to retain payment) based
upon information submitted to HCFA, it must take responsibility for having taken
reasonable steps to assure the accuracy of this information. The attestation forms
developed by HCFA for this purpose require certification that the information submitted is
true and accurate based on best knowledge, information and belief. </p>

<p>The requirement that the CEO or CFO certify as to the accuracy, completeness and
truthfulness of data, based on best knowledge, information and belief, does not constitute
an absolute guarantee of accuracy. Rather, it creates a duty on the Medicare+Choice
organization to put in place an information collection and reporting system reasonably
designed to yield accurate information. Further, the Medicare+Choice organization should
exercise due diligence to ensure that these systems are working properly. The exact
methods used by the Medicare+Choice organization to accomplish this can be determined by
the organization, however, it should ordinarily conduct sample audits and spot checks of
this system to verify whether it is yielding accurate information. </p>

<p>The knowing submission of false information to HCFA can lead to serious criminal or
civil penalties.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a> Medicare+Choice organizations should
implement policies so that the enrollment, encounter and ACR data submitted to HCFA are
accurate, complete and truthful. While information from a variety of sources can affect
this data, Medicare+Choice organizations should take note of two reports issued by the OIG
that have identified concerns in two aspects of this data. </p>

<p>First, the OIG recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations have policies and
procedures in place that ensure that the administrative component of the ACR is calculated
accurately.<a href="#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a> As part of this process, Medicare+Choice
organizations should have clearly defined criteria for claiming reimbursement for their
administrative costs. These costs should not include any costs that are directly
associated with furnishing patient care. All such costs should be allocated to the
applicable operating component. The OIG has articulated serious concerns about the
methodology used by managed care organizations in computing their administrative rate on
the ACR proposal.<a href="#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a> For example, computing an
administrative rate based on the use of a medical utilization factor could generate a
payment that is almost three times what would be charged on the commercial side. </p>

<p>Second, the OIG recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations have adequate internal
controls in place to ensure that the institutional status of beneficiaries is reported
accurately.<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> A recent report issued by OIG estimated
that risk-based HMOs received Medicare overpayments of $22.2 million for beneficiaries
incorrectly classified as institutionalized.<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a> The
incorrect classification was largely due to deficiencies in the HMOs internal controls in
two areas: (1) verification of beneficiaries' institutional status; and (2) reporting of
institutional beneficiaries to HCFA. The results were based on audits of eight randomly
selected HMOs. </p>

<p><strong>f. Anti-kickback</strong> <strong>Statute and Other Inducements</strong> </p>

<p>The anti-kickback statute provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that
knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration to induce the referral
of business reimbursable under a Federal health care program (including Medicare and
Medicaid).<a href="#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> The OIG has promulgated safe harbor
regulations that define practices that are not subject to the anti-kickback statute
because such practices would be unlikely to result in fraud or abuse.<a href="#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The anti-kickback statute potentially applies to many managed care arrangements because
a common strategy of these arrangements is to offer physicians, hospitals and other
providers increased patient volume in return for substantial fee discounts. Because
discounts to managed care organizations can constitute &quot;remuneration&quot; within the
meaning of the anti-kickback statute, a number of health care providers have expressed
concern that many relatively innocuous, or even beneficial, commercial managed care
arrangements implicate the statute and may subject them to criminal prosecution and
administrative sanctions. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that when managed care organizations are paid a capitated amount for
all of the services they provide regardless of the dates, frequency or type of services,
there is no incentive for them to overutilize. In any event, even if overutilization
occurs, the Federal health care programs are not at risk for these increased costs.
Accordingly, OIG will be issuing a safe harbor from the anti-kickback statute that will
provide protection for certain financial arrangements between managed care organizations
(including Medicare+Choice organizations) and individuals or entities with whom they
contract for the provision of health care items or services, where a Federal health care
program pays such organizations on a capitated basis.<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a> </p>

<p>In general, the safe harbor protects payments between capitated managed care
organizations (including Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated care plans)
and individuals or entities with which it has direct contracts to provide or arrange for
the provision of items or services.<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> While this is a
broad exception, there are three important limitations. </p>

<p>The first significant limitation is that there is no protection if the financial
arrangements under the managed care agreement are implicitly or explicitly part of a
broader agreement to steer fee-for-service Federal health care program business to the
entity giving the discount to induce the referral of managed care business. Specifically,
we understand that most managed care organizations have multiple relationships with their
contractors and subcontractors for the provision of services for various product lines,
including non-federal HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and point of service
networks. Consequently, although neither a managed care organization receiving a capitated
payment from a Federal health care program nor its contractors or subcontractors has an
incentive to overutilize items or services or pass additional costs back to the Federal
health care programs under the capitated arrangement, we are concerned that a managed care
organization or contractor may offer (or be offered) a reduced rate for its items or
services in the Federal capitated arrangement in order to have the opportunity to
participate in other product lines that do not have stringent payment or utilization
constraints. This practice is a form of a practice known as &quot;swapping;&quot; in the
case of managed care arrangements, low capitation rates could be traded for access to
additional fee-for-service lines of business. We are concerned when these discounts are in
exchange for access to fee-for-service lines of business, where there is an incentive to
overutilize services provided to Federal health care program beneficiaries. </p>

<p>For example, we would have concerns where an HMO with a Medicare risk contract under
Medicare Part C also has an employer-sponsored PPO that includes retirees and requires
participating providers to accept a low capitation rate for the Medicare HMO risk patients
in exchange for access to the Medicare fee-for-service patients in the PPO. Although in
such circumstances the cost to the Medicare program for the risk-based HMO beneficiaries
will not be increased, there may be increased expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries in
the PPO arrangement, because the providers may have an incentive to increase services to
the Medicare enrollees in the PPO to offset the discounted rates to the Medicare HMO.
Accordingly, such arrangements could violate the anti-kickback statute and should not be
protected. </p>

<p>A second limitation on the regulatory safe harbor protection is that it only applies to
remuneration for health care items and services and those items or services reasonably
related to the provision of health care items and services. It does not cover marketing
services or any services provided prior to a beneficiary's enrollment in a health plan. </p>

<p>Finally, the broad protection is limited to risk-based managed care plans that do not
claim any payment from a Federal health care program other than the capitated amount set
forth in the managed care organization's agreement with the Federal health care program.
Where the managed care plan, its contractors or its subcontractors are permitted to seek
additional payments from any of the Federal health care programs, the regulatory safe
harbor protection is significantly more limited. For example, protection is not extended
to arrangements with subcontractors when the contract under section 1876 of the Social
Security Act is cost-based or where the prime contract is protected solely because the
contracting entity is a Federally-qualified HMO.<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a> In
the first instance, reimbursement from the Federal health care program is based on costs,
and in the latter case, services for Medicare enrollees are reimbursed on a
fee-for-services basis. In both instances, reimbursement will increase with utilization,
thus providing the same incentive to overutilize as any fee-for-service payment
methodology. </p>

<p>While the new safe harbor will provide protection from the anti-kickback statute for
most arrangements between Medicare+Choice organizations and their contractors,
Medicare+Choice organizations should also have policies in place that ensure that any
incentives that the Medicare+Choice organization offers directly or indirectly to
beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries do not run afoul of the anti-kickback statute or
the new civil monetary penalty relating to incentives to beneficiaries.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a>
The CMP was enacted in section 231(h) of HIPAA (42 U.S.C.  1320a-7a(a)(5)) and imposes
sanctions against individuals or entities that offer remuneration to a program beneficiary
that they know, or should know, will influence the beneficiary's decision to order or
receive items or services from a particular provider, practitioner or supplier
reimbursable by Medicare or the State health care programs. </p>

<p>Pending the publication of the final rule implementing this CMP, we can provide the
following guidance. It is our view that organizations that provide incentives to Federal
health care program beneficiaries to enroll in a <u>plan</u> are not offering remuneration
to induce the enrollees to use a <u>particular provider, practitioner orsupplier</u>.
Accordingly, we anticipate that organizations that provide incentives to enroll in a plan
will not be subject to sanctions under this provision. However, incentives provided by
organizations to induce a beneficiary to use a particular provider, practitioner or
supplier once the beneficiary has enrolled in a plan are within the purview of this CMP
and are prohibited if they do not meet an exception. For example, incentives given to
beneficiaries by a particular physician group within the physician panel of a
Medicare+Choice organization to encourage the beneficiary to use that physician group over
another physician in the panel would be prohibited. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>g. Emergency Services </strong></p>

<p>The OIG and HCFA believe that there may be special concerns regarding the provision of
emergency services to enrollees of Medicare+Choice plans. The anti-dumping statute<a
href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a> imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating
hospitals that offer emergency services to individuals presenting themselves at the
hospital seeking possible emergency treatment. While the obligations under the
anti-dumping statute prohibit a hospital from inquiring into the patient's method of
payment or insurance status when it results in the delay of a medical screening
examination and/or stabilizing treatment, it has come to our attention that some hospitals
routinely seek prior authorization from the patient's primary care physician or from the
managed care plan when a managed care patient requests emergency services. Investigations
of allegations of the anti-dumping statute across the country have persuaded the OIG that
managed care patients may be at risk of being discharged or transferred without receiving
a medical screening examination, largely because of the problems inherent in seeking
&quot;prior authorization.&quot; </p>

<p>To ensure appropriate access to emergency services for Medicare+Choice enrollees,
Medicare+Choice organizations should comply with several key provisions. First,
Medicare+Choice organizations are prohibited from requiring prior authorization for
emergency services and must provide coverage for such services without regard to the
emergency care provider's contractual relationship with the Medicare+Choice organization.<a
href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a> Second, payment must be provided for emergency services
based on a &quot;prudent layperson standard,&quot; which means that the need for emergency
services should be determined from a reasonable patient's perspective at the time of
presentation of the symptoms<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> Finally, Medicare+Choice
organizations must comply with all guidelines relating to the efficient and timely
coordination of appropriate maintenance and post-stabilization of an enrollee after the
enrollee has been stabilized under the anti-dumping statute.<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should be particularly careful of the requirements of the
anti-dumping statute in the event that they participate in the so-called &quot;dual
staffing&quot; of emergency departments. Dual staffing occurs when hospitals enter into
arrangements allowing a managed care organization to station its own physicians in the
hospital's emergency department for the purpose of screening and treating managed care
enrollees. Implementation of dual staffing raises some concerns under the anti-dumping
statute, particularly where different procedures and protocols have been established for
each staff. </p>

<p>In addition, Medicare+Choice organizations should be particularly careful in operating
&quot;urgent care&quot; services and in instructing enrollees to contact such services
when enrollees need care. The organizations should ensure that such operations and
instructions do not delay or otherwise compromise enrollees' access to services that
should be provided in a hospital emergency room. </p>

<p><strong>3. Retention of Records and Information Systems</strong> </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs should provide for the
implementation of a records retention system. This system should establish policies and
procedures regarding the creation, distribution, retention, storage, retrieval and
destruction of documents. The three types of documents developed under this system should
include: (1) all records and documentation required by either Federal or State law and the
program requirements of Federal and State health plans;<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
(2) records listing the persons responsible for implementing each part of the compliance
plan; and (3) all records necessary to protect the integrity of the Medicare+Choice
organization's compliance process and confirm the effectiveness of the program. The
documentation necessary to satisfy the third category includes, but is not limited to the
following: evidence of adequate employee training; reports from the Medicare+Choice
organization's hotline; results of any investigation conducted as a consequence of a
hotline call; modifications to the compliance program; all written notifications to
providers regarding compliance activities;<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a> and the
results of the Medicare+Choice organization's auditing and monitoring efforts. </p>

<p>In light of the increasing reliance on electronic data interchange by the health care
industry, Medicare+Choice organizations should take particular care in establishing
procedures for maintaining the integrity of its data collection systems. This should
include procedures for regularly backing-up data (either by diskette, restricted system or
tape) collected in connection with all aspects of the Medicare+Choice program
requirements. </p>

<p>In addition, all Medicare+Choice organizations should develop and implement policies
and procedures to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of financial, medical, personnel
and other sensitive information in their possession.<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a>
These policies should address both electronic and hard copy documents. </p>

<p><strong>4. Compliance as an Element of a Performance Plan</strong> </p>

<p>Compliance programs should require that the promotion of, and adherence to, the
elements of the compliance program be a factor in evaluating the performance of all
relevant employees. Such employees should be periodically trained in new compliance
policies and procedures. Policies should require that managers: </p>

<p>o Discuss with all relevant employees the compliance policies and legal requirements
applicable to their function; </p>

<p>o Inform all relevant personnel that strict compliance with these policies and
requirements is a condition of employment; and </p>

<p>o Disclose to all relevant personnel that the Medicare+Choice organization will take
disciplinary action up to and including termination for violation of these policies or
requirements. </p>

<p>In addition to making performance of these duties an element in evaluations, the
compliance officer or company management should include a policy that managers and
supervisors will be sanctioned for failure to instruct adequately their subordinates or
for failure to detect noncompliance with applicable policies and legal requirements, where
reasonable diligence on the part of the manager or supervisor should have led to the
discovery of any problems or violations. </p>

<p><strong>B. <u>DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND A COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE</u></strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>Every Medicare+Choice organization should designate a compliance officer to serve as
the focal point for compliance activities. This responsibility may be the individual's
sole duty or added to other management responsibilities, depending upon the size and
resources of the Medicare+Choice organization and the complexity of the task. </p>

<p>Designating a compliance officer with the appropriate authority is critical to the
success of the program, necessitating the appointment of a high-level official in the
Medicare+Choice organization with direct access to the company's governing body, the CEO
and all other senior management and legal counsel.<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>
While it is important that the compliance officer have appropriate authority, we are not
suggesting that the compliance officer should have operational responsibility for the
various aspects of the Medicare+Choice program. For example, the compliance officer should
have full authority to stop the submission of data that he or she believes is problematic
until such time as the issue in question has been resolved. In addition, the compliance
officer should be copied on the results of all internal audit reports and work closely
with key managers to identify aberrant trends in the areas that require certification. The
compliance officer must have the authority to review all documents and other information
that are relevant to compliance activities, including, but not limited to, enrollee
records (where appropriate) and records concerning the marketing efforts of the
organization and the Medicare+Choice organization arrangements with other parties,
including employees, professionals on staff, relevant independent contractors, suppliers,
agents and physicians. This policy enables the compliance officer to review contracts and
obligations (seeking the advice of legal counsel, where appropriate) that may contain
referral and payment provisions that could violate statutory or regulatory requirements. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Coordination and communication are the key functions of the compliance officer with regard
to planning, implementing and monitoring the compliance program. With this in mind, the
OIG recommends that the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance officer closely
coordinate compliance functions with providers' compliance officers. </p>

<p>The compliance officer should have sufficient funding and staff to fully perform his or
her responsibilities. These duties should include: </p>

<p>o Overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the compliance program;<a
href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Reporting on a regular basis to the Medicare+Choice organization's governing body,
CEO and compliance committee on the progress of implementation; </p>

<p>o Periodically revising the program in light of changes in the organization's needs and
in the law and policies and procedures of Government and private payor health plans; </p>

<p>o Reviewing employees' certifications stating that they have received, read and
understood the standards of conduct; </p>

<p>o Developing, coordinating and participating in a multifaceted educational and training
program that focuses on the elements of the compliance program and seeks to ensure that
all appropriate employees and management are knowledgeable of, and comply with, pertinent
Federal and State standards; </p>

<p>o Coordinating personnel issues with the Medicare+Choice organization's human
resources/personnel office (or its equivalent) to ensure that providers and employees do
not appear in the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the General Services
Administration (GSA) list of debarred contractors;<a href="#N_83_"><sup>(83)</sup></a> </p>

<p>o Assisting the Medicare+Choice organization's management in coordinating internal
compliance review and monitoring activities, including annual or periodic reviews of
departments; </p>

<p>o Independently investigating and acting on matters related to compliance, including
the flexibility to design and coordinate internal investigations (<u>e.g.</u>, responding
to reports of problems or suspected violations) and any resulting corrective action with
all departments, providers, agents, and, if appropriate, independent contractors; </p>

<p>o Developing policies and programs that encourage managers and employees to report
suspected fraud and other improprieties without fear of retaliation; and </p>

<p>o Continuing the momentum of the compliance program and the accomplishment of its
objectives long after the initial years of implementation. </p>

<p><strong>2. Compliance Committee</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that a compliance committee be established to advise the compliance
officer and assist in the implementation of the compliance program.<a href="#N_84_"><sup>(84)</sup></a>
When assembling a team of people to serve as the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance
committee, the company should include individuals with a variety of skills.<a
href="#N_85_"><sup>(85)</sup></a> The OIG strongly recommends that the compliance officer
manage the compliance committee. Once a managed care organization chooses the people that
will accept the responsibilities vested in members of the compliance committee, the
organization must train these individuals on the policies and procedures of the compliance
program. </p>

<p>The committee's responsibilities should include: </p>

<p>o Analyzing the organization's regulatory environment, the legal requirements with
which it must comply and specific risk areas; </p>

<p>o Assessing existing policies and procedures that address these areas for possible
incorporation into the compliance program; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
o Working with appropriate departments, as well as affiliated providers, to develop
standards of conduct and policies and procedures that promote allegiance to the
organization's compliance program; </p>

<p>o Recommending and monitoring, in conjunction with the relevant departments, the
development of internal systems and controls to carry out the organization's standards,
policies and procedures as part of its daily operations; </p>

<p>o Determining the appropriate strategy/approach to promote compliance with the program
and detection of any potential violations, such as through hotlines and other fraud
reporting mechanisms; </p>

<p>o Developing a system to solicit, evaluate and respond to complaints and problems; and </p>

<p>o Monitoring internal and external audits and investigations for the purpose of
identifying troublesome issues and deficient areas experienced by the Medicare+Choice
organization and implementing corrective and preventive action. </p>

<p>The committee may also address other functions as the compliance concept becomes part
of the overall operating structure and daily routine. </p>

<p><strong>C. <u>CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND EDUCATION</u></strong> </p>

<p>The proper education and training of corporate officers, managers, employees and the
continual retraining of current personnel at all levels are significant elements of an
effective compliance program. Where appropriate, the Medicare+Choice organization may
afford its contractors the opportunity to participate in the organization's compliance
training and educational programs.<a href="#N_86_"><sup>(86)</sup></a>The contractors
should be encouraged to develop their own compliance programs that complement the
Medicare+Choice organization's compliance program. </p>

<p><strong>1. Formal Training Programs </strong></p>

<p>To ensure the appropriate information is being disseminated to the correct individuals,
the Medicare+Choice organization training program should include both a general session
and specialized sessions on specific risk areas. All employees should attend the general
session on compliance. Employees whose job responsibilities implicate specific risk areas
(<u>e.g.</u>, marketing or data collection and submission) should attend the specialized
sessions. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that attendance and participation at training programs be made a
condition of continued employment and that failure to comply with training requirements
should result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, when such failure is
serious. The Medicare+Choice organization should retain adequate records of its training
of employees, including attendance logs and material distributed at training sessions. New
employees should be targeted for training early in their employment, and to the extent
that they perform complicated tasks with greater organizational legal exposure, should be
monitored closely until all training is completed. </p>

<p><strong>a. General Sessions</strong> </p>

<p>As part of their compliance programs, Medicare+Choice organizations should require all
employees to attend annual training that emphasizes the organization's commitment to
compliance with all Federal and State statutes and requirements, and the policies of
private payors. While the OIG recognizes that not all standards, policies and procedures
need to be communicated to all employees, it believes that the general message about the
importance of complying with fraud and abuse laws and other ethical areas should be
addressed and made part of the general training. </p>

<p>As part of the initial training, the standards of conduct should be distributed to all
employees. Every employee should be required to sign and date a statement that reflects
the employee's knowledge of, and commitment to the standards of conduct. This attestation
should be retained in the employee's personnel file. The standards of conduct should be
updated and revised as appropriate. </p>

<p><strong>b. Specialized Training</strong> </p>

<p>Because Medicare+Choice organizations are responsible for compliance in all of the risk
areas mentioned in section II.A. above, the OIG recommends Medicare+Choice organizations
require individuals who are involved in the risk areas to receive specialized training.
For example, marketing employees should receive training on the marketing, enrollment,
disenrollment and anti-kickback policies. All employees who work with beneficiaries or
providers regarding medical services should receive appropriate training on the risks
associated with underutilization. Those employees who are involved in developing
enrollment, encounter and ACR data should receive training on HCFA policies in these
areas. Clarifying and emphasizing these areas of concern through training and educational
programs are particularly relevant to a Medicare+Choice organization's marketing and
financial personnel, in that the pressure to meet business goals may render these
employees particularly vulnerable to engaging in prohibited practices. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends Medicare+Choice organizations' compliance programs address the need
for periodic professional education courses for relevant personnel. Such courses would be
in addition to the internal training sessions provided by the organization. </p>

<p><strong>c. Format of the Training Program</strong> </p>

<p>The OIG suggests all relevant levels of personnel be made part of various educational
and training programs of the Medicare+Choice organization. Employees should be required to
have a minimum number of educational hours per year, as appropriate, as part of their
employment responsibilities. A variety of teaching methods, such as interactive training
and training in several different languages (including the translation of standards of
conducts and other materials), particularly where a Medicare+Choice organization has a
culturally diverse staff, should be implemented so that all affected employees are
knowledgeable about the institution's standards of conduct and procedures for alerting
senior management to problems and concerns. In addition, the materials should be written
at appropriate reading levels for targeted employees. All training materials should be
designed to take into account the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual
trainees. Post-training tests can be used to assess the success of training provided and
employee comprehension of the Medicare+Choice organization's policies and procedures. </p>

<p><strong>2. Informal and Ongoing Compliance Training </strong></p>

<p>It is essential that compliance issues remain at the forefront of the Medicare+Choice
organization's priorities. The organization must demonstrate its commitment by continuing
to disseminate the compliance message. One effective mechanism to achieve this goal is to
publish a monthly compliance newsletter, or devote a section to compliance in a general
weekly or monthly existing newsletter. This would allow the Medicare+Choice organization
to address specific examples of problems the company encountered during its ongoing audits
and risk analysis, while reinforcing the company's firm commitment to the general
principles of compliance and ethical conduct. The newsletter could also include the risk
areas identified in current OIG publications or investigations. Finally, the
Medicare+Choice organization could use the newsletter as a mechanism to notify employees
of significant legal or regulatory developments. The Medicare+Choice organization should
maintain its newsletters in a central location to document the guidance offered and
provide new employees with access to guidance previously provided. Other written
materials, such as posters, fliers or articles in other company publications, could also
be used to disseminate the compliance message. </p>

<p>Another effective method of maintaining the presence of the compliance message is to
maintain a web site devoted to compliance issues. This could be linked to the homepage of
the organization. Many organizations have chosen to maintain these sites internally on the
Intranet to alleviate any confidentiality concerns. The Intranet (or Internet) also
facilitates the use of hypertext links that allow the organization to maintain a
centralized source on statutory, regulatory and other program guidance disseminated by
HCFA, the OIG, the Department of Justice and the Congress. These links, along with any
other web pages that the Medicare+Choice organization deems pertinent and useful can be
assembled on a single site that can, by hypertext link, provide access to all of these
useful resources. </p>

<p><strong>D. <u>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</u></strong> </p>

<p>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and Medicare+Choice
organization personnel, as well as among the organization, health care providers and
enrollees, is critical to the successful implementation of a compliance program and the
reduction of any potential for fraud, abuse and waste. Each organization should have in
place both a mechanism for the reporting of improper conduct, as well a mechanism for more
routine types of communication among the compliance officer and relevant groups. </p>

<p><strong>1. Hotline or Other System for Reports of Potential Misconduct</strong> </p>

<p>Each Medicare+Choice organization should have in place a hotline or other mechanism<a
href="#N_87_"><sup>(87)</sup></a>through which employees, enrollees or other parties can
report potential violations of the organization's compliance policies or of Federal or
State health care program requirements. In any event, several independent reporting paths
should be created for an employee to report fraud, waste or abuse so that such reports
cannot be diverted by supervisors or other personnel. If the organization establishes a
hotline, the telephone number should be made readily available to all employees, enrollees
and independent contractors, by circulating the number on wallet cards or conspicuously
posting the telephone number in common work areas.<a href="#N_88_"><sup>(88)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Matters reported through the hotline or other communication sources that suggest
violations of compliance policies, Federal and State health care program requirements,
regulations or statutes should be documented and investigated promptly to determine their
veracity and significance. A log should be maintained by the compliance officer or
authorized designee that records such calls, including the nature of any investigation and
its results.<a href="#N_89_"><sup>(89)</sup></a> Such information should be included in
reports to the governing body, the CEO and compliance committee. </p>

<p>Employees, enrollees and providers should be permitted to report matters on a
confidential basis. To encourage such reporting, written confidentiality and
non-retaliation policies should be developed. Employees, enrollees, providers and other
contractors should be made aware of these policies to encourage communication and the
reporting of incidents of potential fraud.<a href="#N_90_"><sup>(90)</sup></a> While the
Medicare+Choice organization should always strive to maintain the confidentiality of the
reporter's identity, the policies should explicitly communicate that there may be a point
where the individual's identity may become known or may have to be revealed. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that assertions of fraud and abuse by those who may have
participated in illegal conduct or committed other malfeasance raise numerous complex
legal and management issues that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The
compliance officer may wish to work closely with legal counsel to obtain guidance on these
issues. </p>

<p><strong>2. Routine Communication/Access to the Compliance Officer</strong> </p>

<p>While it is crucial that Medicare+Choice organizations have effective systems in place
for the reporting of suspected misconduct, it is equally important that the compliance
officer foster more routine communication both among its employees and among its health
care providers and enrollees. </p>

<p>With respect to its own employees, the OIG encourages the establishment of procedures
for personnel to seek clarification from the compliance officer or members of the
compliance committee in the event of any confusion or question regarding a company policy,
practice or procedure. Questions and responses should be documented and dated and, if
appropriate, shared with other staff so that standards, policies, practices and procedures
can be updated and improved to reflect any necessary changes or clarifications. The
compliance officer may want to solicit employee input in developing these communication
and reporting systems. The methods discussed above relating to ongoing training and
education are an integral part of this communication.<a href="#N_91_"><sup>(91)</sup></a> </p>

<p>The communication and coordination function of the compliance program serves an even
more critical role in the context of the managed care environment because the managed care
entity serves as an intermediary between the health care provider and the enrollee. In
fact, the raison d'tre of a managed care organization is to coordinate the care of its
enrollees. As with providers, communications with beneficiaries and communications with
HCFA (and its designees) must demonstrate the highest level of integrity, honesty and
judgment. The Medicare+Choice organization should implement methods to encourage
communication among its enrollees and providers. For example, as appropriate, a
Medicare+Choice organization should communicate the results of audits, disenrollment
surveys, utilization data and quality of care determinations to its contracting suppliers
and providers in order to facilitate open discussion regarding appropriate health care
delivery. </p>

<p><strong>E. <u>AUDITING AND MONITORING</u></strong> </p>

<p>An ongoing evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program.<a
href="#N_92_"><sup>(92)</sup></a> The OIG believes an effective program should incorporate
thorough monitoring of its implementation and regular reporting to senior company
officers. Compliance reports created by this ongoing monitoring, including reports of
suspected noncompliance, should be maintained by the compliance officer and reviewed with
the Medicare+Choice organization's senior management and the compliance committee. The
extent and frequency of the audit function may vary depending on factors such as the size
of the company, the resources available to the company, the company's prior history of
noncompliance and the risk factors that are prevalent in a particular organization.
However, all Medicare+Choice organizations have an obligation to establish an adequate
audit function and meet all of HCFA's requirements. </p>

<p>Although many monitoring techniques are available, one effective tool to promote and
ensure compliance is the performance of regular, periodic compliance audits by internal or
external auditors who have expertise in Federal and State health care statutes,
regulations and Federal health care program requirements. The audits should focus on the
Medicare+Choice organization's programs or divisions, including external relationships
with third-party contractors, specifically those with substantive exposure to Government
enforcement actions. The audits should cover the range of programmatic requirements of the
Medicare+Choice program and comply with generally accepted protocols governing such
audits. In particular, the audits should focus on the risk areas identified earlier in
this document, especially the data and information that affect payments by Medicare.
Finally, the Medicare+Choice organization should focus on any areas of specific concern
identified within that organization and those that may have been identified by any outside
agency, whether Federal or State. </p>

<p>Monitoring techniques may include sampling protocols that permit the compliance officer
to identify and review variations from an established baseline.<a href="#N_93_"><sup>(93)</sup></a>
Significant variations from the baseline should trigger a reasonable inquiry to determine
the cause of the deviation. If the inquiry determines that the deviation occurred for
legitimate, explainable reasons, the compliance officer or manager may want to limit any
corrective action or take no action. If it is determined that the deviation was caused by
improper procedures, misunderstanding of rules, including fraud and systemic problems, the
Medicare+Choice organization should take prompt steps to correct the problem.<a
href="#N_94_"><sup>(94)</sup></a> Any overpayments discovered as a result of such
deviations should be reported promptly to HCFA (or its designees), with appropriate
documentation and a thorough explanation of the reason for the overpayment.<a
href="#N_95_"><sup>(95)</sup></a> </p>

<p>An effective compliance program should also incorporate periodic (at a minimum, annual)
reviews of whether the program's compliance elements have been satisfied, <u>e.g.</u>,
whether there has been appropriate dissemination of the program's standards, training,
ongoing educational programs and disciplinary actions.<a href="#N_96_"><sup>(96)</sup></a>
This process will verify actual conformance by all departments with the compliance
program. Such reviews may support a determination that appropriate records have been
created and maintained to document the implementation of an effective program. </p>

<p>The reviewers involved in any audits should: </p>

<p>o Possess the qualifications and experience necessary to adequately identify potential
issues with the subject matter to be reviewed; </p>

<p>o Be independent of the specific functional area examined; </p>

<p>o Have access to existing audit resources, relevant personnel and all relevant areas of
operation; </p>

<p>o Present written evaluative reports on compliance activities to the CEO, governing
body members of the compliance committee on a regular basis, but not less than annually;
and </p>

<p>o Specifically identify areas where corrective actions are needed. </p>

<p>In the Medicare+Choice context, a variety of different methods will be necessary to
adequately monitor and evaluate the ongoing operations of the Medicare+Choice
organization. In general, OIG recommends the use of techniques such as on-site visits,
questionnaires (for providers, enrollees and employees), and trend analyses, to name just
several.<a href="#N_97_"><sup>(97)</sup></a> Because the auditing and monitoring function
is very different and much more complex in the managed care context than in any other
segment of the health care industry, we have provided additional guidance on the methods
to be used in evaluating selected risk areas. </p>

<p><strong>1. Marketing/Enrollment/Disenrollment</strong> </p>

<p>Developing a system for evaluating the compliance of the marketing, enrollment and
disenrollment functions of a Medicare+Choice organization requires innovative techniques.
Each Medicare+Choice organization will have to develop an individualized method as to how
to obtain this data. Some of the methods that the OIG suggests include: using secret
shoppers; surveying<a href="#N_98_"><sup>(98)</sup></a> current enrollees;<a href="#N_99_"><sup>(99)</sup></a>
and conducting exit interviews with former enrollees (particularly those that disenrolled
just prior to obtaining an expensive service) on their experience with the Medicare+Choice
marketing and enrollment process. Once this data is collected, it must be maintained in a
format that can be accessed readily. </p>

<p>In an effort to integrate the monitoring function with its training function, a
Medicare+Choice organization may wish to test its marketing staff on their knowledge of
the company's policies and procedures, as well as the Federal and State statutes that
govern the marketing process. This assessment can be developed using many formats. Many
companies have customized interactive software to test employees' knowledge of relevant
policies and procedures. It may also be formulated in the traditional written version. </p>

<p>Methods used to monitor marketing agents include the analysis of disenrollment data to
identify marketing agents with high and low percentages of member disenrollments within a
set number of days (<u>e.g.</u>, 90 days). In addition, Medicare+Choice organizations may
want to establish enrollment verification systems requiring that a different individual
from the sales agent meet with beneficiaries who have applied for enrollment to ensure
that they understand restrictions of the plan, such as the lock-in provision. </p>

<p>Finally, it is essential for all marketing materials to be reviewed by an independent
and competent reviewer, such as an individual in the general counsel's office, to ensure
that they do not mislead, confuse or misrepresent any aspect of the plan. Similarly, a
Medicare+Choice organization may want to consider having the materials examined by
individuals familiar with the claims processing department and utilization review office
for consistency with the policies, procedures and practices of these departments. </p>

<p><strong>2. Underutilization and Quality of Care</strong> </p>

<p>Procedures for tracking and reporting utilization review data are vital to the success
of any compliance endeavor. Medicare+Choice organizations should periodically review the
service areas that are part of the Medicare+Choice organization to ensure that enrollees
are receiving adequate access to care. In reviewing service areas, Medicare+Choice
organizations should collect data on a variety of topics, including the number of primary
care physicians in the service area, the number and type of specialists in the service
area, the waiting time for appointments, the telephone access to the Medicare+Choice
organization, rates of denial of emergency services claims and the problems associated
with the coordination of care. All of this data should be maintained in a database in a
format that can be used to generate statistical data and analysis. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should ensure that there are adequate systems in place to
monitor underutilization and inappropriate denials. Such procedures include collecting
data on utilization patterns and detecting aberrant patterns. This data should be checked
against utilization rates in the industry. This function could be performed by a medical
affairs department that is responsible for regular review of claims, the payment system,
encounter data and medical record review to assess the degree to which care is under (or
over) utilized. </p>

<p>Similarly, the Medicare+Choice organization should survey its enrollees on utilization
patterns and whether they felt they were subjected to inadequate health care services,
inappropriate denials, type of practitioner providing treatment and whether a
beneficiary's request for another provider was denied or approved. Such survey results
should be reviewed and investigated, when appropriate. Generally, these may be skewed in
favor of the Medicare+Choice organization if the enrollees are current members.
Presumably, if an enrollee was truly dissatisfied with the Medicare+Choice organization's
attitude toward enrollee rights, the enrollee would have disenrolled from the plan. As a
result, a Medicare+Choice organization should evaluate both current enrollee satisfaction
surveys and exit interview surveys of former enrollees. </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations have a good source of information regarding utilization
issues, simply by tracking the type of appeals and grievances they receive from
beneficiaries. This information should be tracked in a database that can be easily
accessed by type of grievance or appeal and results. </p>

<p><strong>3. Data Collection and Submission Processes</strong> </p>

<p>Given the importance of the enrollment, encounter and ACR data, the Medicare+Choice
organization should develop ways to audit this information to assure its accuracy,
completeness and truthfulness, on best knowledge, information and belief. As indicated
earlier, such methods would ordinarily include sample audits and spot checks of the
system. These activities should be facilitated by the fact that HCFA requires
Medicare+Choice organizations to detail in their contractual relationships with providers
the access that they will need to the provider's medical record documentation. </p>

<p><strong>4. Anti-Kickback</strong> <strong>and Other Inducements</strong> </p>

<p>Medicare+Choice organizations should periodically review their contractual documents
and discussions with providers to ensure that &quot;swapping&quot; is not occurring. In
addition, contracts with marketing personnel should be reviewed by legal counsel to be
sure they do not violate the anti-kickback statute and other applicable statutes and
regulations. </p>

<p><strong>F. <u>ENFORCING STANDARDS THROUGH WELL-PUBLICIZED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND
POLICIES REGARDING DEALINGS WITH INELIGIBLE PERSONS</u></strong> </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that all Medicare +Choice organizations' compliance programs include
several key policies in the area of personnel/human resources. The first deals with the
establishment, and consistent application of, appropriate disciplinary policies to deal
with improper conduct and the second deals with the employment of certain ineligible
individuals. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1">
<strong>1. Consistent Enforcement of Disciplinary Policies </strong></p>

<p>An effective compliance program should include guidance regarding disciplinary action
for all employees who have failed to comply with the Medicare+Choice organization's
standards of conduct, policies and procedures, Federal health care program requirements,
or Federal and State laws, or those who have otherwise engaged in wrongdoing. It is vital
to publish and disseminate the range of possible disciplinary actions for improper conduct
and to educate officers and other staff regarding these standards. Employees should be
advised that disciplinary action may be appropriate where a responsible employee's failure
to detect a violation is attributable to his or her negligence or reckless conduct. The
sanctions could range from oral warnings to suspension, termination or other sanctions, as
appropriate. While each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine
the appropriate sanction, intentional or reckless noncompliance should subject
transgressors to significant sanctions. </p>

<p>The written standards of conduct should elaborate on the procedures for handling
disciplinary problems and identify who will be responsible for taking appropriate action.
For example, while disciplinary actions can be handled by department managers, others may
have to be resolved by a more senior official of the organization. Personnel should be
advised by the organization that disciplinary action will be taken on a fair and equitable
basis, that is, all levels of employees should be subject to similar disciplinary action
for the commission of similar offenses. Managers and supervisors should be held
accountable to implement the disciplinary policy consistently so that the policy will have
the required deterrent effect. </p>

<p><strong>2. Employment of, and Contracting with, Ineligible Persons </strong></p>

<p>All Medicare+Choice organizations should use care when delegating substantial
discretionary authority to make decisions that may involve compliance with the law or
compliance oversight. In particular, the organization should ensure that it does not
delegate such responsibilities to individuals or entities that it knows, or should have
known, have a propensity to engage in inappropriate or improper conduct. Pursuant to the
compliance program, a Medicare+Choice organization's policies should prohibit the hiring
of, or entering into, contracts with individuals or entities who have been recently
convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are listed as debarred,
excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation in Federal health care programs.<a
href="#N_100_"><sup>(100)</sup></a> The policies should require the Medicare+Choice
organization to utilize Government resources to determine whether such individuals or
entities are debarred or excluded. These resources should be used for both potential
employees (as part of the employment application process, which should also include a
reasonable and prudent background investigation), and should be used to periodically check
existing employees and contractors. </p>

<p>Lists of debarred and excluded individuals and entities are currently maintained by
both the OIG and the General Services Administration.<a href="#N_101_"><sup>(101)</sup></a>
By approximately January 2000, the Healthcare Integrity Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) will
be available to Medicare+Choice organizations (for a nominal fee) to use in conducting
these checks on employees and contractors.<a href="#N_102_"><sup>(102)</sup></a> The HIPDB
is an electronic data collection program that will collect, store and disseminate reports
on practitioners, providers and suppliers that have been the subject of health care
related final adverse actions in criminal, civil and administrative proceedings. The final
adverse actions to be reported to the HIPDB include criminal convictions or civil
judgments related to the delivery of health care, actions by Federal or State agencies
responsible for licensing or certification of health care providers, suppliers and
practitioners, exclusions from Federal or State health care programs, and certain final
adverse actions taken by health plans.<a href="#N_103_"><sup>(103)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Pending the resolution of any known criminal charges or proposed debarment or
exclusion, the OIG recommends that such individuals should be removed from direct
responsibility for, or involvement in, any Federal health care program. If labor
agreements make such removal legally impermissible, the OIG recommends that the individual
be closely supervised in all aspects of his or her duties that relate to Federal health
care programs. If the resolution of the matter results in conviction, debarment or
exclusion of a current employee or contractor, then the Medicare+Choice organization must
not continue to employ or contract with such individual for the provision of health care,
utilization review, medical social work or administrative services. <a href="#N_104_"><sup>(104)</sup></a>
</p>

<p><strong>G. <u>RESPONDING TO DETECTED OFFENSES, DEVELOPING CORRECTIVE ACTION
INITIATIVES, AND REPORTING TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES</u></strong> </p>

<p>Violations of the Medicare+Choice organization's compliance program, failures to comply
with applicable Federal or State law, rules and program instructions and other types of
misconduct may threaten a Medicare+Choice organization's status as a reliable, honest and
trustworthy company. Detected but uncorrected misconduct can seriously endanger the
mission, reputation and legal status of the organization. Consequently, it is important
that the chief compliance officer or other management officials promptly investigate and
take appropriate action with respect to any reports or reasonable indications of suspected
noncompliance.<a href="#N_105_"><sup>(105)</sup></a> </p>

<p>Pending issuance of final HCFA regulations <a href="#N_106_"><sup>(106)</sup></a>
regarding the obligations of a Medicare+Choice organizations to report misconduct, the OIG
recommends that the following procedures be followed when a Medicare+Choice organization
discovers from any source evidence of misconduct related to payment or delivery of health
care items or services under the Medicare+Choice contract. First, the Medicare+Choice
organization should conduct a timely, reasonable inquiry into the misconduct. Second, if
after reasonable inquiry, the organization has determined that the misconduct may violate
criminal, civil or administrative law, it should report the existence of the misconduct
promptly to the appropriate Government authority<a href="#N_107_"><sup>(107)</sup></a>within
a reasonable period, but not more than 60 days<a href="#N_108_"><sup>(108)</sup></a> after
a determination that a violation may have occurred.<a href="#N_109_"><sup>(109)</sup></a>
When reporting potential violations to the Government, a Medicare+Choice organization
should provide all evidence relevant to the potential violation, including the impact of
the potential violation on beneficiaries and any potential cost impact. Finally, the
Medicare+Choice organization should initiate and implement appropriate corrective actions,
<u>e.g.</u>, repayment of overpayments, disciplinary actions and modifications of
procedures to ensure the problem does not recur. </p>

<p>Failure to notify HCFA of an overpayment within a reasonable period of time could be
interpreted as an intentional attempt to conceal the overpayment from the Government,
thereby establishing an independent basis for a criminal violation with respect to the
Medicare+Choice organization, as well as any individuals who may have been involved.<a
href="#N_110_"><sup>(110)</sup></a> For this reason, Medicare+Choice compliance programs
should ensure that overpayments are identified quickly and promptly return overpayments
obtained from Medicare or other Federal health care programs. </p>

<p>The OIG recommends that Medicare+Choice organizations consider the following guidance
as they structure internal inquiries. Depending upon the nature of the alleged violations,
an internal inquiry will probably include interviews and a review of relevant documents.
Medicare+Choice organizations should consider engaging outside counsel, auditors or health
care experts to assist in an inquiry. Records of the inquiry should contain documentation
of the alleged violation, a description of the process (including the objectivity of the
investigators and methodologies utilized), copies of interview notes and key documents, a
log of the witnesses interviewed and the documents reviewed, and the results of the
investigation, <u>e.g.</u>, any disciplinary action taken and any corrective action
implemented. Although any action taken as the result of an inquiry will necessarily vary
depending upon the Medicare+Choice organization and the situation, Medicare+Choice
organizations should strive for some consistency by utilizing sound practices and
disciplinary protocols. Further, after a reasonable period, the compliance officer should
review the circumstances that formed the basis for the inquiry to determine whether
similar problems have been uncovered or modifications of the compliance program are
necessary to prevent and detect other inappropriate conduct or violations. </p>

<p>If an inquiry of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance officer believes
the integrity of the inquiry may be at stake because of the presence of employees under
investigation, those subjects should be removed from their current work activity until the
inquiry is completed (unless an internal or Government-led undercover operation known to
the Medicare+Choice organization is in effect). In addition, the compliance officer should
take appropriate steps to secure or prevent the destruction of documents or other evidence
relevant to the inquiry. If the Medicare+Choice organization determines disciplinary
action is warranted, it should be prompt and imposed in accordance with the organization's
written standards of disciplinary action. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>

<p>Through this document, the OIG has attempted to provide a foundation for the
development of effective and comprehensive Medicare+Choice compliance programs. These
principles can also be used by entities to develop compliance programs applicable to other
Federal and health care programs, as well as for their private lines of business. As
previously stated, however, each program must be tailored to fit the needs and resources
of an individual organization, depending upon its particular corporate structure, mission
and employee composition. The statutes, regulations and guidelines of the Federal and
State health insurance programs, as well as the policies and procedures of the private
health plans, should be integrated into every Medicare+Choice organization's compliance
program. </p>

<p>The OIG recognizes that the health care industry, which reaches millions of
beneficiaries and expends about a trillion dollars annually, is constantly evolving. In no
area of the industry is this more evident than in the growing area of managed care,
particularly Medicare managed care. As a result, the time is right for Medicare+Choice
organizations to implement strong, voluntary compliance programs. Compliance is a dynamic
process that helps to ensure Medicare+Choice organizations are better able to fulfill
their commitment to ethical behavior and to meet the changes and challenges being imposed
upon them by the Congress and private insurers. It is OIG's hope that voluntarily created
compliance programs will enable Medicare+Choice organizations to meet their goal of
providing efficient and quality health care and, at the same time, substantially reducing

<p>2. A Medicare+Choice organization is defined as a public or private entity
organized and licensed by a State as a risk-bearing entity (with the exception of
provider-sponsored organizations receiving waivers) that is certified by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) as meeting the Medicare+Choice contract requirements. 42
C.F.R.  422.2. <a name="N_3_"></a></p>

<p>3. For the purposes of this compliance program guidance, a &quot;coordinated care
plan&quot; is a plan that includes a network of providers that are under contract or
arrangement with the organization to deliver the benefit package approved by HCFA. 42
U.S.C.  1395w-28(a)(1); 42 C.F.R.  422.4. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>

<p>4. In this guidance, we have focused our attention on regulations applicable to
Medicare+Choice organizations governing marketing, enrollment, disenrollment,
underutilization, data collection, anti-kickback statute and emergency services, rather
than providing instruction on all aspects of regulatory compliance. <a name="N_5_"></a></p>

<p>5. The regulations require that any plan contracting with HCFA implement a
compliance plan that encompasses the elements detailed in the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines. 42 C.F.R.  422.501(b)(vi). HCFA will release an operational policy letter
addressing the compliance requirements detailed in the regulation. In response to concerns
from industry representatives on the short time frame for implementing a compliance plan,
HCFA delayed the actual implementation date of the compliance plan until January 1, 2000. <a
name="N_6_"></a></p>

<p>6. The OIG, for example, will consider the existence of an <u>effective</u>
compliance program that pre-dated any Governmental investigation when addressing the
appropriateness of administrative sanctions. However, the burden is on the Medicare+Choice
organization to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of a compliance program.
Further, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729-3733, provides that a person who has
violated the Act, but who voluntarily discloses the violation to the Government within
thirty days of detection, in certain circumstances will be subject to not less than
double, as opposed to treble, damages. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C.  3729(a). In addition, an
organization will receive sentencing credit for an &quot;effective&quot; compliance
program under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing
Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8C2.5. Thus, the ability to react quickly
when violations of the law are discovered may materially reduce the Medicare+Choice
organization's liability. <a name="N_7_"></a></p>

<p>13.Corporate integrity agreements are executed as part of a civil settlement
agreement between the health care provider and the Government to resolve a case based on
allegations of health care fraud or abuse. These OIG-imposed agreements are generally in
effect for a period of three to five years and require many of the elements included in
this compliance guidance. <a name="N_14_"></a></p>

<p>14. 42 C.F.R.  422.501(b)(vi). <a name="N_15_"></a></p>

<p>15. The OIG appreciates that because Medicare+Choice organizations are subject to
substantial regulations that contain extensive operational requirements as well as
requirements regarding self-monitoring and monitoring or review of activities by external
organizations, they may already be performing some of the activities discussed in this
guidance. Each Medicare+Choice organization must determine the extent to which these
activities need to be modified or supplemented to create an effective compliance program. <a
name="N_16_"></a></p>

<p>16. Formal commitment may include a resolution by the board of directors, where
applicable. A formal commitment <u>does</u> include the allocation of adequate resources
to ensure that each of the elements is addressed. <a name="N_17_"></a></p>

<p>17. 42 C.F.R.  422.502(i). <a name="N_18_"></a></p>

<p>18. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>,
8A1.2, comment. (n.3(k)). The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are detailed policies and
practices for the Federal criminal justice system that prescribe appropriate sanctions for
offenders convicted of Federal crimes. <a name="N_19_"></a></p>

<p>19. When determining to whom to distribute various policies, the Medicare+Choice
organizations should keep in mind that, according to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, an
organization must have established compliance standards to be followed by its employees
and other agents in order to receive sentencing credit. The Guidelines define
&quot;agent&quot; as &quot;any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee,
or an independent contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization.&quot; <u>See</u>
United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines Manual</u>, 8A1.2,
Application Note 3(d). <a name="N_20_"></a></p>

<p>20.This includes, but is not limited to, the Medicare+Choice provisions and the
fraud and abuse provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33; the civil
False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729-3733; the criminal false claims statutes, 18 U.S.C.
 287, 1001; the fraud and abuse provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Pub.L. 104-191; and the civil monetary penalties in
the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7a and 42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(g). <u>See also</u>
42 C.F.R.  422.1-422.312. <a name="N_21_"></a></p>

<p>21. The Medicare+Choice organization should document its efforts to formulate its
policies to comply with applicable statutes, regulations and program requirements. For
example, where a Medicare+Choice organization requests advice from HCFA, the
Medicare+Choice organization should document and retain a record of the request and any
written or oral response. This step is extremely important if the Medicare+Choice
organization intends to rely on that response to guide it in future decisions, actions or
appeals. In addition, the Medicare+Choice organization should maintain records relevant to
the issue of whether its reliance was &quot;reasonable,&quot; and whether it exercised due
diligence in developing procedures to implement the advice. <a name="N_22_"></a></p>

<p>22.<sup> </sup>Medicare+Choice organizations should regularly access the HCFA
managed care website at http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mgdcar1.htm for updates on
regulations and operational policies. Operational Policy Letters can be located on HCFA's
website at http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/mgd-ops.htm. <a name="N_23_"></a></p>

<p>23. Medicare+Choice organizations may also want to consult the OIG's Work Plan when
conducting the risk assessment. The OIG Work Plan details the various projects the OIG
currently intends to address in the fiscal year. It should be noted that the priorities in
the Work Plan are subject to modification and revision as the year progresses and the Work
Plan does not represent a complete or final list of areas of concern to the OIG. The Work
Plan is currently available on the Internet at http://www.hhs.gov/oig/. <a name="N_24_"></a></p>

<p>24. &quot;Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an organization has
previously committed casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable steps to prevent such
misconduct&quot; and is a significant factor in the assessment of whether a compliance
program is effective. <u>See</u> United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, <u>Guidelines
Manual</u>, 8A1.2, Application Note 3(7)(ii). <a name="N_25_"></a></p>

<p>25. Although many of these areas apply specifically to Medicare+Choice
organizations, many of the areas identified below have analogous issues in non-Medicare
organizations. Medicare+Choice organizations that provide private managed care products
should consider establishing additional policies and procedures for risk areas that apply
specifically to those areas. Although the policies may be integrated, they should
identify, as appropriate, where deviations may be necessary to meet Medicare+Choice
requirements or state licensure requirements. <a name="N_26_"></a></p>

<p>26. Medicare+Choice organizations should ensure that they conform to fair marketing
standards as set forth in the statute, the Medicare Managed Care National Marketing Guide
(Marketing Guide) and all HCFA Operational Policy Letters affecting marketing matters. <a
name="N_27_"></a></p>

<p>27. 42 U.S.C.  1395w-27(g). <a name="N_28_"></a></p>

<p>28. Medicare+Choice organizations may not distribute marketing materials or
election forms unless they have submitted them to HCFA for review 45 days prior to
distribution and HCFA has not disapproved their distribution. 42 C.F.R.  422.80. <a
name="N_29_"></a></p>

<p>31. 42 C.F.R.  422.80(c)(3). <a name="N_32_"></a></p>

<p>32. It should be noted that Medicare+Choice organizations have ultimate
responsibility for the acts and omissions of its marketing agents. 42 C.F.R.

<p>35. OIG is also concerned about a similar problem, known as
&quot;gerrymandering,&quot; which is an attempt to eliminate certain high dollar risk
areas from the Medicare+Choice organization's service area. Medicare+Choice organizations
should have policies in place to avoid such practices. <a name="N_36_"></a></p>

<p>36. Although the Medicare+Choice program has attempted to alleviate many of the
selective marketing practices through the use of risk adjustment, the phase-in period for
risk-adjustment virtually assures that this will remain a troubling issue through 2004. <a
name="N_37_"></a></p>

<p>41. In fact, Medicare+Choice organizations are required to allocate part of their
resources to marketing to the Medicare population with disabilities. 42 C.F.R. 
422.80(e)(2)(i). <a name="N_42_"></a></p>

<p>42. The statute prohibits the provision of cash or other monetary rebates as an
inducement for enrollment in the plan. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395w-21(h)(4)(A). However,
HCFA allows Medicare+Choice organizations to give Medicare beneficiaries nominal value
gifts, provided that the plan offers these gifts whether or not the beneficiary enrolls in
the plan. HCFA defines nominal value as an item having little or no resale value
(generally, less than $10), which cannot be readily converted into cash. <u>See</u>
Marketing Guide, Chapter II. The use of inducements is also discussed in Section II.A.2.f.
- Anti-kickback and Other Inducements. <a name="N_43_"></a></p>

<p>43. 42 C.F.R.  422.66(d). <a name="N_44_"></a></p>

<p>44. Medicare+Choice organizations are entitled to disenroll individuals under
certain circumstances, <u>e.g.</u>, failure to pay premiums or engagement in disruptive
behavior. 42 C.F.R.  422.74. <a name="N_45_"></a></p>

Disenrolling from Medicare Managed Care.&quot; (A-07-98-01256)(May 1999). <a name="N_47_"></a></p>

<p>47. Such policies should be consistent with the provisions that prohibit
Medicare+Choice organizations from restricting a health care professional from advising
patients of the &quot;<u>health status</u> of the individual or <u>medical care or
treatment for the individual's condition or disease</u>, regardless of whether benefits
for such care or treatment are provided under the plan.&quot; <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C. 
1852(j)(3)(emphasis added). <a name="N_48_"></a></p>

with the standards contained in the Quality Improvement System for Managed Care (QISMC)
for Organizations Contracting with Medicare or Medicaid. <a name="N_49_"></a></p>

<p>49. Medicare+Choice organizations can be subject to sanctions for failing
substantially to provide medically necessary items and services that are required to be
provided, if the failure has adversely affected (or has the substantial likelihood of
adversely affecting) the individual. 42 U.S.C.  1395w-27(g)(1)(A). <a name="N_50_"></a></p>

<p>61. On a related topic, Medicare+Choice organizations should also be sure that
their computer systems are Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant. An OIG report indicates that managed
care organizations have made significant progress in this regard, with more than 80%
indicating that they are Y2K compliant. &quot;Y2K Readiness of Managed Care

under a Federal health care program is a Federal offense punishable by not more than
$25,000 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b. In
addition, a CMP can be imposed for the misrepresentation or falsification of information
submitted to HCFA under Medicare+Choice. <u>See</u> 42 U.S.C.  1395w-27(g)(1)(E). <a

<p>68. 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(b). If it is determined that a party has violated the
anti-kickback statute, the individual or entity can be excluded from participation in the
Medicare and other Federal health care programs (as defined in 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(f)).
42 U.S.C.  1320a-7(b)(7). In addition, there is an administrative CMP provision for
violating the anti-kickback statute. 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7a(a)(7). <a name="N_69_"></a></p>

<p>69. 42 C.F.R.  1001.952. The safe harbors set forth specific conditions that, if
met, assure entities involved of not being prosecuted or sanctioned for the arrangement
qualifying for the safe harbor. However, safe harbor protection is afforded only to those
arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions set forth in the safe harbor. The
failure of an arrangement to fit inside a safe harbor or statutory exception does not mean
that the arrangement is illegal. It is incorrect to assume that arrangements outside of a
safe harbor are suspect due to that fact alone. That an arrangement does not meet a safe
harbor only means that the arrangement does not have guaranteed protection and must be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <a name="N_70_"></a></p>

<p>70.This safe harbor was developed in accordance with section 216 of HIPAA and
section 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 (Pub.
L. 100-93) through a negotiated rulemaking process that began in the spring of 1997. For a
more detailed description of the negotiated rulemaking, <u>see</u>the Committee Statement
of the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee on the Shared Risk Exception (January 22, 1998),
which can be found on the Internet at http://www.hhs.gov/oig/. <a name="N_71_"></a></p>

<p>71. In addition, arrangements between direct contractors and all subcontractors or
successive tiers of subcontractors are protected, as long as the arrangement is for the
provision of health care items or services that are covered by the arrangement between the
direct contractor and the managed care organization and the arrangement meets the
requirements applicable to arrangements between the direct contractor and the managed care
organization. <a name="N_72_"></a></p>

<p>72. The arrangements may qualify for other safe harbors, such as the discount or
personal services safe harbors. <a name="N_73_"></a></p>

<p>73. Our concerns regarding the use of inducements in a manner that leads to
enrollment of only healthy beneficiaries, such as offering memberships to exercise clubs
for purposes of patient screening, is discussed above in Section II.A.2.b.- Selective
Marketing and Enrollment. <a name="N_74_"></a></p>

<p>78. These documents should be maintained for the periods required by the HCFA
Medicare+Choice regulations. <a name="N_79_"></a></p>

<p>79. This should include notifications regarding: quality of care issues; confusing
or inaccurate encounter data; and termination of the contract. <a name="N_80_"></a></p>

<p>80. 42 U.S.C.  1395w-22(h); 42 C.F.R.  422.118. <a name="N_81_"></a></p>

<p>81. The OIG believes that it is not advisable for the compliance function to be
subordinate to the Medicare+Choice organization's general counsel, comptroller or similar
company financial officer. Free-standing compliance functions help to ensure independent
legal reviews and financial analyses of the institution's compliance activities. By
separating the compliance function from the key management positions of general counsel or
CFO (where the size and structure of the organization make this a feasible option), a
system of checks and balances is established to more effectively achieve the compliance
program's goals. <a name="N_82_"></a></p>

<p>82. For multi-site Medicare+Choice organizations, the OIG encourages coordination
with each facility owned by the Medicare+Choice organization through the use of compliance
liaisons at each site. <a name="N_83_"></a></p>

<p>83. <u>See</u> note 101. <a name="N_84_"></a></p>

<p>84. The compliance committee benefits from having the perspectives of individuals
with varying responsibilities in the organization, such as operations, finance, audit,
human resources, utilization review, medicine, claims processing, information systems,
legal, marketing, enrollment and disenrollment as well as employees and managers of key
operating units. These individuals should have the requisite seniority and comprehensive
experience within their respective departments to implement any necessary changes in the
company's policies and procedures. Some organizations have found it helpful to include an
outside director on its compliance committee to provide a different perspective. <a
name="N_85_"></a></p>

<p>85. A Medicare+Choice organization should expect its compliance committee members
and compliance officer to demonstrate high integrity, good judgment, assertiveness and an
approachable demeanor, while eliciting the respect and trust of employees of the
organization. The compliance committee members should also have significant professional
experience in working with quality assurance, enrollment, marketing, clinical records and
auditing principles. <a name="N_86_"></a></p>

<p>86. While some Medicare+Choice organizations may encourage providers to participate
in education programs designed for its own employees, other organizations may prefer to
develop provider-specific education programs about compliance. <a name="N_87_"></a></p>

<p>87. The OIG recognizes that it may not be financially feasible for a small
Medicare+Choice organization to maintain a telephone hotline dedicated to receiving calls
solely on compliance issues. These companies may explore alternative methods, <u>e.g.</u>,
contracting with an independent source to provide hotline services or establishing a
written method of confidential disclosure. <a name="N_88_"></a></p>

<p>88. Medicare+Choice organizations should also post in a prominent, available area
the HHS-OIG Hotline telephone number, 1-800-447-8477 (1-800- HHS-TIPS), in addition to any
organization's hotline number that may be posted. <a name="N_89_"></a></p>

<p>89. To efficiently and accurately fulfill such an obligation, the Medicare+Choice
organization should create an intake form for all issues identified through reporting
mechanisms. The form could include information concerning the date the potential problem
was reported, the internal investigative methods utilized, the results of any
investigation, any corrective action implemented, any disciplinary measures imposed and
any overpayments and monies returned. <a name="N_90_"></a></p>

<p>90. The OIG believes that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation, a
concept embodied in the provisions of the False Claims Act. <u>See</u> 31 U.S.C. 
3730(h). In many cases, employees sue their employers under the False Claims Act's <u>qui</u>
<u>tam</u>provisions out of frustration because of the company's failure to take action
when a questionable, fraudulent or abusive situation was brought to the attention of
senior corporate officials. <a name="N_91_"></a></p>

<p>91.<sup> </sup>In addition to methods of communication used by current employees,
an effective employee exit interview program could be designed to solicit information from
departing employees regarding potential misconduct and suspected violations of the
Medicare+Choice organization's policy and procedures. <a name="N_92_"></a></p>

<p>92. OIG recognizes that Medicare+Choice organizations have a variety of ongoing
monitoring processes and would most likely incorporate these existing processes, as
appropriate, into their compliance program. We do not anticipate that the compliance
monitoring function would exist entirely independently of the operational program. <a
name="N_93_"></a></p>

<p>93. The OIG recommends that when a compliance program is established in a
Medicare+Choice organization, the compliance officer, with the assistance of department
managers, take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the organization's operations from a compliance
perspective. This assessment can be undertaken by outside consultants, law or accounting
firms, or internal staff, with authoritative knowledge of health care compliance
requirements. This &quot;snapshot,&quot; often used as part of bench marking analysis,
becomes a baseline for the compliance officer and other managers to judge the
Medicare+Choice organization's progress in reducing or eliminating potential areas of
vulnerability. Medicare+Choice organizations should track statistical data on utilization
review and quality data based on customer satisfaction and renewal data. This will
facilitate identification of problem areas and elimination of potential areas of abusive
or fraudulent conduct. <a name="N_94_"></a></p>

<p>94. Prompt steps to correct the problem include contacting the appropriate provider
in situations where the provider's actions contributed to the problem. <a name="N_95_"></a></p>

<p>95. In addition, when appropriate, as referenced in section G, below, reports of
fraud or systemic problems should also be made to the appropriate Government authority. <a
name="N_96_"></a></p>

<p>96. One way to assess the knowledge, awareness and perceptions of the
Medicare+Choice organization's staff is through the use of a validated survey instrument (<u>e.g.</u>,
employee questionnaires, interviews or focus groups). <a name="N_97_"></a></p>

<p>97. Medicare+Choice organizations may want to consult HCFA's Contractor Performance
Monitoring System Manual to get additional ideas for monitoring methods. In addition,
organizations may want to consult the OAS website for information on conducting audits,
including information on statistical sampling (RAT-STATS). <u>See</u> note 10. <a
name="N_98_"></a></p>

<p>98. Medicare+Choice organizations may be able to use response data from already
existing surveys, such as from the Health of Seniors survey (HEDIS) and for certain
organizations, the mandatory disenrollment surveys required under PIP. <a name="N_99_"></a></p>

<p>99. It should be noted, while this method may be less expensive, it may not provide
unbiased data, particularly in the area of selective marketing. In fact, in the selective
marketing area, the data may be skewed significantly in favor of the Medicare+Choice
organization. <a name="N_100_"></a></p>

<p>100. Prospective employees who have been officially reinstated into the Medicare
and Medicaid programs by the OIG may be considered for employment upon proof of such
reinstatement. <a name="N_101_"></a></p>

<p>101.<sup> </sup>OIG's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities is available on the
Internet at http://www.hhs.gov/oig/ and the GSA list of debarred contractors is available
on the Internet at http://epls.arnet.gov/. <a name="N_102_"></a></p>

<p>102. 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7e. <a name="N_103_"></a></p>

<p>103. Note that agencies and health plans are <u>required</u> by HIPAA to report to
the HIPDB. Failure by a health plan to make the mandated reports to the HIPDB may result
in CMPs being assessed against the health plan, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7e(b)(6). <a
name="N_104_"></a></p>

<p>104. 42 C.F.R.  422.752(a)(8). <a name="N_105_"></a></p>

<p>105. Instances of non-compliance must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
existence, or amount, of a <u>monetary</u> loss to a health care program is not solely
determinative of whether or not the conduct should be investigated and reported to
governmental authorities. In fact, there may be instances where there is no readily
identifiable monetary loss at all, but corrective action and reporting are still necessary
to protect the integrity of the applicable program and its beneficiaries. <a name="N_106_"></a></p>

<p>106. 42 C.F.R.  422.501(b)(vi). <a name="N_107_"></a></p>

<p>107. For example, if the potential violation relates to federal criminal law, the
civil False Claims Act, the civil monetary penalty authorities (primarily under sections
1128A and 1857 of the Social Security Act) and related statutes administered by the
HHS/OIG, the report must be made to that office. <a name="N_108_"></a></p>

<p>108. While the OIG recommends reporting in 60 days, the organization must report
within 30 days in order to attempt to obtain favorable treatment under the civil False
Claims Act. <u>See</u> note 6. In addition, reporting such conduct may be considered a
mitigating factor by the OIG in determining administrative sanctions (<u>e.g.</u>,
penalties, assessments and exclusion), if the reporting company becomes the subject of an
OIG investigation. <u>See</u> 62 Fed. Reg. 67,392 (12/24/97). <a name="N_109_"></a></p>

<p>109. The OIG believes that some potential violations may be so serious that they
warrant immediate notification to Government authorities, prior to, or simultaneous with,
commencing an internal inquiry. Examples of such situations include instances when the
misconduct: (1) is a clear violation of civil fraud or criminal law; (2) has a significant
adverse effect on the quality of care provided to program beneficiaries (in addition to
any other legal obligations regarding quality of care); or (3) indicates evidence of a
systemic failure to comply with applicable laws or an existing corporate integrity
agreement, regardless of the financial impact on Federal health care programs. <a
