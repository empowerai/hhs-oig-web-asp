  <br>
  for Third-Party Medical Billing Companies</strong> </big></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Inspector General June Gibbs Brown of the Department of Health and Human Services 
  today released the fourth set of compliance guidelines, the &quot;Compliance 
  Program Guidance for Third-Party Medical Billing Companies.&quot; &quot;This 
  guidance, designed to assist companies that process bills for the nation's health 
  care providers in preventing fraud, waste and abuse, affects virtually every 
  segment of the health care industry,&quot; said Inspector General Brown. <br>
  <br>
  Developed by the department's Office of Inspector General, the guidance is part 
  of the OIG's ongoing effort to work collaboratively with the public and private 
  sectors to establish a comprehensive and practical set of guidelines aimed at 
  assisting billing companies and the nation's health care professionals in complying 
  with Federal health care program requirements. The OIG developed these guidelines 
  in tandem with the Health Care Financing Administration, the Department of Justice, 
  and representatives of various trade associations and health care practice groups. 
  <br>
  <br>
  &quot;These voluntary guidelines will help ensure that billing companies submit 
  proper claims to Medicare, and that Medicare pays those claims appropriately,&quot; 
  Health Care Financing Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said. &quot;Such efforts 
  will reduce the waste, fraud and abuse that harms beneficiaries and taxpayers 
  alike.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The foundation of this voluntary guidance mirrors the compliance elements set 
  forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and OIG's previously issued compliance 
  program guidances. The seven elements articulated in these guidelines include: 
  implementation of written policies, procedures and standards of conduct; designation 
  of a high-level compliance officer and other appropriate officials; development 
  of training and education programs; creation of hotlines or other measures for 
  receiving complaints and procedures for protecting callers from retaliation; 
  enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary directives; performance 
  of internal audits; and prompt response to detected offenses through corrective 
  action. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Increasingly,&quot; Brown said, &quot;billing companies are providing 
  crucial services that could greatly impact the solvency and stability of the 
  Medicare Trust Fund. Health care providers rely on billing companies to assist 
  them in processing claims in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. 
  Additionally, health care professionals are consulting with billing companies 
  to provide timely and accurate advice with regard to reimbursement matters, 
  as well as overall business decision-making. As a result, the OIG considers 
  this compliance program guidance particularly important in the partnership to 
  defeat health care fraud.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The nature of the billing company's third-party relationship provides unique 
  challenges for these organizations in developing a compliance program that will 
  promote adherence to applicable federal, state and private health care program 
  requirements. An individual billing company may support a variety of providers, 
  all with different specialities, and consequently different statutory and regulatory 
  frameworks. It is with this in mind that the OIG strongly recommends that billing 
  companies coordinate with their provider-clients in establishing compliance 
  responsibilities. The key to a successful compliance program in the third-party 
  context is open and frequent communication. <br>
  <br>
  The OIG identified the following specific risk areas for billing companies: 
  billing for services or items that have not been documented; duplicate billing; 
  unbundling; upcoding; inappropriate balance billing; inadequate resolution of 
  overpayments; lack of integrity of computer systems; failure to properly use 
  modifiers; routine waiver of copayments; and improper discounts on professional 
  services. The risk areas should be the focus of the company's initial compliance 
  efforts. In particular, the billing company should focus its training and audit 
  efforts on identified risk areas. <br>
  <br>
  In response to considerable interest in the reporting requirements of the original 
  draft of the guidance, the OIG developed a bifurcated reporting requirement 
  system. If a billing company discovers credible evidence of misconduct in its 
  own activities, the billing company should report such conduct immediately to 
  the appropriate government authorities. If a billing company discovers credible 
  evidence of the provider-clients misconduct, the billing company may either: 
  (1) terminate the contract; or (2) report the misconduct to the appropriate 
  government authorities. <br>
  <br>
  The OIG emphasizes that misconduct does not include inadvertent errors or mistakes. 
  Such errors should be reported through the normal channels, including a notification 
  to the provider of the error and all necessary information for the provider 
  to make a timely repayment to the applicable payor. However, if a pattern of 
  these type of errors occurs on the part of the provider-client, the billing 
  company may wish to take the next step and either: (1) report the misconduct; 
  or (2) terminate the contract. The OIG feels strongly that this bifurcated system 
  strikes an appropriate balance between the billing company's responsibility 
  for integrity and solvency of the Medicare program and its delicate third party 
  relationship with its clients. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;While compliance with the guidelines is strictly voluntary, the existence 
  of an effective compliance program could mitigate any action taken against a 
  billing company caught in subsequent wrongdoing. The OIG has articulated to 
  the health care industry that the existence of an effective compliance program 
  will be considered when determining the nature and level of administrative sanctions, 
  penalties and exclusions to be imposed against a company,&quot; said Mrs. Brown. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier guidance was issued for hospitals, clinical laboratories and home health 
  agencies. Drafts of compliance program guidance for the Durable Medical Equipment, 
  Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies industry and Medicare+Choice Organizations 
  offering Coordinated Care Plans will be published in the Federal Register early 
  next year. </p>
