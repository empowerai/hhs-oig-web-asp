    COMPLIANCE PLAN FOR CLINICAL LABORATORIES</H2>
</center>
<center>
  <H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
</center>
<P>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human 
  Services (HHS) and other Federal agencies charged with responsibility for enforcement 
  of Federal law have emphasized the importance of voluntarily developed and implemented 
  compliance plans. In recent years, the OIG has been asked to supply guidance 
  as to the elements of a model compliance plan. The purpose of this issuance, 
  therefore, is to respond to those requests by providing some guidance to health 
  care providers that supply clinical laboratory testing services for Medicare 
  and Medicaid beneficiaries. Like other compliance plan models that will be issued 
  for other areas of the health care community, this guidance is based upon the 
  OIG's experience in fraud investigations of clinical laboratories, the Health 
  Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) regulations and guidelines, requirements 
  imposed on clinical laboratories in corporate integrity agreements negotiated 
  by the OIG, and input from the clinical laboratory industry. </P>
<P>The government, especially the OIG, has a zero tolerance policy towards fraud 
  and abuse and will use its extensive statutory authorities to reduce fraud in 
  Medicare and other federally funded health care programs. Compliance plans offer 
  the health care provider an opportunity to participate in a nationwide effort 
  to reduce fraud and abuse in our national health care programs. The OIG believes 
  that through a partnership with the private sector, significant reductions in 
  fraud and abuse can be accomplished. Compliance plans offer a vehicle to achieve 
  that goal. </P>
<P>This information is being supplied to assist laboratory providers in crafting 
  and refining their own compliance plans. Elements of these guidelines can be 
  used by all laboratories, regardless of size, to establish a compliance program. 
  We are not suggesting that all laboratories must implement all of the compliance 
  elements discussed in this document, nor do we suggest that a laboratory that 
  does not incorporate all of these elements will be at a disadvantage when under 
  the scrutiny of the OIG or other governmental agency. Rather, these guidelines 
  represent the government's suggestions on how to correct and prevent fraudulent 
  activity, and they can be tailored to fit the individual needs and financial 
  realities of any clinical laboratory, be it an independent national laboratory, 
  a hospital laboratory, or a small, regional laboratory. We expect variations 
  reflecting the specific factual context in which each individual laboratory 
  operates. </P>
<P>This model compliance plan focuses on topic areas recently addressed in corporate 
  integrity agreements with several players in the laboratory industry. Consequently, 
  this model laboratory compliance plan is not all inclusive as to subject matter. 
  We recognize that laboratories are accountable for complying with far more laws, 
  regulations and guidelines than we have tried to cover in this model, and we 
  believe that laboratories implementing compliance plans should address any and 
  all areas where abuse may be prevalent in the industry. For example, the OIG 
  suggests that laboratory compliance programs should include training on topics 
  such as, the anti-kickback act, Stark self-referral issues and CLIA requirements. 
  Depending on the nature of its business, a laboratory also may need to add specific 
  measures covering areas such as ESRD testing and billing, which is governed 
  by rules and regulations and which has been subject to abuse by many companies. 
  Ultimately, each company bears the responsibility for determining the appropriate 
  topic areas and measures to be included in its compliance program.</P>
<P>We see this model compliance plan as a dynamic document, and therefore, one 
  that may be modified or expanded as we gather more information and knowledge 
  about best practices and successful compliance plans. Through this document, 
  we are attempting to provide guidance and structure to assist providers as they 
  attempt to comply with our civil, criminal and health care laws. All providers 
  should be aware that the development and implementation of compliance programs 
  can raise a host of sensitive and complex legal issues. Nothing stated herein 
  should substitute for or be used in lieu of legal advice from competent, experienced 
  counsel. In addition, it should be noted that implementing a compliance program 
  will not provide a laboratory with immunity from criminal, civil or administrative 
  prosecution, but it may be a relevant factor in negotiations with the Office 
  of Inspector General. </P>
<center>
  <H3>COMPLIANCE PLAN ELEMENTS</H3>
</center>
<P>Every laboratory adopting a compliance plan should develop a program and policies 
  that ensure that the plan is implemented and enforced. Compliance plans that 
  are merely cosmetic are not effective and, in the long run, may harm the laboratory. 
  The OIG suggests that the comprehensive compliance program should include, at 
  a minimum, the following elements: (1) written standards of conduct for employees; 
  (2) the development and distribution of written policies that promote the laboratory's 
  commitment to compliance and that address specific areas of potential fraud, 
  such as billing, marketing and claims processing; (3) the designation of a chief 
  compliance officer or other appropriate high-level corporate structure or official 
  who is charged with the responsibility of operating the compliance program; 
  (4) the development and offering of education and training programs to all employees; 
  (5) the use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance 
  and ensure a reduction in identified problem areas; (6) the development of a 
  code of improper/illegal activities and the use of disciplinary action against 
  employees who have violated internal compliance policies or applicable laws 
  or who have engaged in wrongdoing; (7) the investigation and remediation of 
  identified systemic and personnel problems; (8) the promotion of and adherence 
  to compliance as an element in evaluating supervisors and managers; (9) the 
  development of policies addressing the non-employment or retention of sanctioned 
  individuals; (10) the maintenance of a hotline to receive complaints and the 
  adoption of procedures to protect the anonymity of complainants; and (11) the 
  adoption of requirements applicable to record creation and retention. These 
  compliance program elements are spelled out in greater detail below. </P>
<H4>A. WRITTEN PROCEDURES AND POLICIES</H4>
<P>Laboratory compliance plans should require the development and distribution 
  of written compliance policies. These policies should be developed under the 
  supervision and direction of the chief compliance officer or the equivalent 
  and should, at a minimum, be provided to all individuals who are affected by 
  the specific policy at issue. One convenient method of achieving this goal and 
  maintaining policies is to create a three-ring compliance policy notebook. This 
  format permits the filing of new and amended or revised compliance policies 
  and ensures that affected individuals have easy access to the laboratory's written 
  policies.</P>
<P> <B>1. Standards of Conduct </B> </P>
<P>Laboratories should develop standards of conduct for all employees which clearly 
  delineate the policies of the laboratory with regard to fraud, waste and abuse 
  and adherence to all guidelines and regulations governing federally funded health 
  care programs. These standards should be made available to and understandable 
  by all employees (e.g., translated into other languages, if necessary) and regularly 
  updated as the policies and regulations of these programs are modified. </P>
<B> 
<P>2. Medical Necessity</P>
</B> 
<P>Laboratory compliance plans should ensure that claims are only submitted to 
  federally funded health care programs for services that the laboratory has reason 
  to believe are medically necessary. Upon request, a laboratory should be able 
  to provide documentation, such as requisition forms containing diagnosis codes, 
  supporting the medical necessity of a service the laboratory has provided and 
  billed to a Federal program. We recognize that laboratories do not and cannot 
  treat patients or make medical necessity determinations. However, there are 
  steps that such facilities can and should take to help maximize the likelihood 
  that they only bill federally funded health care programs for tests that meet 
  the reimbursement rules for those programs. </P>
<P>As a preliminary matter, the OIG recognizes that physicians must be able to 
  order any tests, including screening tests, that they believe are appropriate 
  for the treatment of their patients. However, we believe that physicians must 
  be made aware that Medicare will only pay for tests that meet the Medicare definition 
  of "medical necessity" and that Medicare may deny payment for a test that the 
  physician believes is appropriate, such as a screening test, but which does 
  not meet the Medicare definition of medical necessity. The laboratories themselves 
  are in a unique position to deliver this information to their physician clients. 
</P>
<P>In our opinion, laboratories can and should advise physicians that when they 
  instruct the laboratory to seek Medicare reimbursement for tests ordered, they 
  should only order those tests that they believe are medically necessary for 
  the diagnosis and treatment of their patients. We recommend that laboratories 
  implement the following steps through their compliance plans or some other appropriate 
  mechanism to help ensure, as best they can, that the claims they submit to federally 
  funded health care programs meet the appropriate program requirements: </P>
<DD>a. <I>Requisition Design</I>: Each laboratory (or laboratory company) should 
  standardize its noncustomized test offerings and use common, uniform requisition 
  forms that emphasize physician choice and encourage doctors to order, to the 
  extent possible, only those tests that they believe are appropriate for each 
  patient. In addition, the requisition forms should require physicians to document 
  the need for each test ordered by inserting a diagnosis code for each such test. 
  With respect to chemistry tests, requisition forms should be designed to require 
  physicians to order such tests individually (i.e., separately) unless: (1) the 
  test is specifically part of a CPT or HCPCS defined automated multichannel test 
  series (e.g., 80002-80019, G0058-G0060 which will be amended to G0095-G0098) 
  ); (2) the test is part of a CPT-defined "clinically relevant test grouping" 
  such as an organ or disease panel or profile (e.g., 80050-80099); or (3) the 
  test is part of a profile that has been customized at the request of the physician. 
  In addition, a printed statement should appear on every requisition form reiterating 
  that when ordering tests for which Medicare reimbursement will be sought, physicians 
  (or other individuals authorized by law to order tests ) should only order tests 
  that are medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient, rather 
  than for screening purposes. </DD>
<p> 
<DD>b. <I>Notices to Physicians</I>: All laboratories should provide all of their 
  clients with annual written notices that set forth: (1) the Medicare medical 
  necessity policy; (2) the individual components of every laboratory profile 
  that includes a multichannel chemistry test or other automated multiple test 
  result (e.g., 80002-80019, G0058-G0060); (3) the CPT or HCPCS codes that the 
  laboratory uses to bill the Medicare program for each such profile; (4) the 
  Medicare National Limitation Amount for each CPT or HCPCS code used to bill 
  Medicare for each profile and its components; and (5) a description of how the 
  laboratory will bill Medicare for each profile. If the laboratory engages a 
  physician clinical consultant, the notice also should provide the phone number 
  of the physician clinical consultant and advise of his or her availability to 
  discuss appropriate testing and test ordering.
  <P> In addition to the general notices above, laboratories offering clients 
    the opportunity to create customized profiles should provide all clients who 
    request customized profiles with annual notices that: (1) explain the Medicare 
    reimbursement paid for each component of each such profile; (2) encourage 
    physicians who are ordering tests for which Medicare reimbursement will be 
    sought to order only tests that are medically necessary for each patient; 
    (3) inform physicians that using a customized profile may result in the ordering 
    of tests for which Medicare may deny payment; and (4) inform physicians that 
    the OIG takes the position that a physician who orders medically unnecessary 
    tests for which Medicare reimbursement is claimed may be subject to civil 
    penalties. Once again, if the laboratory engages a physician clinical consultant, 
    the notice also should provide the phone number of the physician clinical 
    consultant and advise of his or her availability to discuss appropriate testing 
    and test ordering.
</DD>
<p> 
<DD>c. <I>Physician Acknowledgments</I>: Laboratories that agree to customize 
  profiles in response to physician requests should require such requesting physicians 
  to sign a Physician Acknowledgment. By signing the Physician Acknowledgment, 
  the physician would affirm that: (1) the physician has requested the creation 
  of a custom profile that includes the tests listed on the acknowledgment; (2) 
  the physician has been informed of the reimbursement amount that Medicare (and 
  where appropriate, Medicaid) will pay for each test included in each customized 
  profile; (3) the physician understands that when ordering tests for which Medicare 
  reimbursement will be sought, the physician should only order those tests which 
  the physician believes are medically necessary for each patient; (4) the physician 
  knows that using a customized profile may result in the ordering of tests for 
  which Medicare or other federally funded health care programs may deny payment; 
  (5) the physician will order individual tests or a less inclusive profile when 
  not all of the tests included in the customized profile are medically necessary 
  for an individual patient; (6) the physician has been informed that the OIG 
  takes the position that a physician who orders medically unnecessary tests may 
  be subject to civil penalties; and (7) if appropriate, the physician is aware 
  that the laboratory makes available the services of a clinical consultant to 
  assist the physician in ensuring that appropriate tests are ordered.</DD>
<p> 
<DD>d. <I>Test Utilization Monitoring</I>: The OIG believes that laboratories 
  can and should take the steps described above to help ensure that physicians 
  will make a determination and document the medical necessity of tests billed 
  to the Medicare program. We also believe that there are steps laboratories can 
  take to determine whether physicians are being encouraged to order medically 
  unnecessary tests. The OIG believes that a laboratory which has reason to believe 
  that its clients are ordering medically unnecessary tests has a duty to determine 
  why that behavior has occurred. More importantly, if the laboratory discovers 
  that it has in some way caused that behavior, we believe the laboratory has 
  the duty to correct the cause. </DD>
<P>Recognizing that there may be other ways to do so, the OIG suggests the following 
  methodology for monitoring test utilization and detecting ordering abuses. We 
  suggest that laboratories retain and analyze test utilization data from year 
  to year, by CPT or HCPCS code, for the top 30 tests they perform for Medicare 
  beneficiaries. Laboratories could do this by keeping track of the number of 
  tests performed by CPT or HCPCS code or of the number of claims submitted to 
  Medicare for each test. The laboratories would then compute the percentage growth 
  in claims submitted for each of the top 30 tests from one year to the next. 
  We believe that if a test's utilization grew more than 10 percent, the laboratory 
  should undertake a reasonable inquiry to ascertain the cause of such growth. 
  If the laboratory determines that the increase in test utilization occurred 
  for a benign reason, such as the acquisition of a new laboratory facility, then 
  the laboratory need not take any action. However, if the laboratory determines 
  that the increase in utilization was caused by the use of basic chemistry profiles 
  or some other action on the part of the facility, the laboratory should take 
  any steps that it deems reasonably necessary to address the issue and to insure 
  that fraud is not being committed. </P>
<P> <b>3. Billing</b> </P>
<P>Laboratory compliance policies should ensure that all claims for testing services 
  submitted to Medicare or other federally funded health care programs are accurate 
  and correctly identify the services ordered by the physician (or other individual 
  authorized by law to order tests) and performed by the laboratory.</P>
<P>a. <I>Selection of CPT or HCPCS Codes</I>: Laboratory compliance policies should 
  ensure that the CPT or HCPCS code that is used to bill Medicare or Medicaid 
  accurately describes the service that was ordered and performed. Laboratories 
  should choose only the code that most accurately describes the ordered and performed 
  test. To ensure code accuracy, laboratories may wish to include a requirement 
  that the codes be reviewed by individuals with technical expertise in laboratory 
  testing before such codes are approved for claims submissions. The OIG views 
  intentional up coding (i.e., the selection of a code to maximize reimbursement 
  when such code is not the most appropriate descriptor of the service) as raising 
  false claims issues. If a laboratory continues to have questions about code 
  selection, even after review by technical experts, the facility should direct 
  its questions to its Medicare carrier or intermediary.</P>
<P>b. <I>Selection of ICD-9CM Codes</I>: At the direction of the Health Care Financing 
  Administration (HCFA), Medicare carriers and intermediaries have established 
  lists of tests that must be accompanied by diagnostic information to establish 
  medical necessity before Medicare coverage will be assumed ("limited coverage 
  policy"). Such diagnostic information may be submitted either through the use 
  of ICD-9CM codes or a narrative description. Laboratory compliance policies 
  should direct that laboratories will only submit diagnostic information obtained 
  from the test ordering physician. Laboratories should not: (1) use diagnostic 
  information provided by the physician from earlier dates of service (other than 
  standing orders, as discussed below at paragraph 4); (2) use "cheat sheets" 
  that provide diagnostic information that has triggered reimbursement in the 
  past; (3) use computer programs that automatically insert diagnosis codes without 
  receipt of diagnostic information from the physician; or (4) make up diagnostic 
  information for claims submission purposes. Laboratories should: (1) contact 
  the ordering physician to obtain diagnostic information in the event that the 
  physician has failed to provide such information; (2) provide services and diagnostic 
  information supplied pursuant to a standing order executed in connection with 
  an extended course of treatment; and (3) accurately translate narrative diagnoses 
  obtained from the physician to ICD-9CM codes. Where diagnostic information is 
  obtained from a physician or the physician's staff after receipt of the specimen 
  and the requisition form, documentation of the receipt of such information should 
  be created and maintained.</P>
<P>c. <I>Tests Covered by Claims for Reimbursement</I>: Laboratory compliance 
  policies should ensure that the laboratory only submits claims for tests that 
  were both ordered and performed. If a laboratory receives a specimen without 
  a test order or with an ambiguous test order that is subject to multiple interpretations, 
  the facility should check with the doctor to determine what tests he or she 
  wanted performed before submitting a claim for reimbursement to Medicare. Thus, 
  if the laboratory performed a test that the doctor did not order, the laboratory 
  will not erroneously bill for that test. Similarly, if a laboratory cannot perform 
  an ordered test due to, for example, a laboratory accident or insufficient quantities 
  of specimen, the laboratory should not submit a claim to Medicare. The OIG considers 
  the submission of a claim for tests that were either not ordered or were not 
  performed to be a potential false claim.</P>
<P>d. <I>Billing of Automated Multichannel Chemistry Tests</I>: Laboratory compliance 
  policies should ensure that the laboratory bills Medicare appropriately for 
  automated multichannel chemistry tests. All tests appearing on HCFA's most recent 
  list of automated multichannel chemistry tests should be billed using the appropriate 
  CPT (80002-80019) or HCPCS (G0058- G0060) codes. Tests appearing on this list 
  should not be billed individually unless only one such analyte test is ordered 
  and performed.</P>
<P>e. <I>Billing of Calculations</I>: Since the OIG views compliance programs 
  as a check and balance system to reduce error and improve quality, laboratory 
  compliance policies should ensure that the laboratory does not bill for both 
  calculations (e.g., calculated LDLs, T7s, indices, to name only a few) and the 
  tests that are performed to derive such calculations. In many situations, physicians 
  are not offered a choice about whether to receive such calculations, nor are 
  they aware of the practice of some laboratories to bill Medicare for such calculations 
  in addition to the underlying tests, as the physicians themselves are only billed 
  for the underlying tests. At the current time, the OIG views billing for both 
  the calculations and the underlying tests to be double billing which may subject 
  a laboratory to criminal or civil penalties. </P>
<P> <b>4. Reliance on Standing Orders</b> </P>
<P>Although standing orders are not prohibited in connection with an extended 
  course of treatment, too often in the past they have led to fraudulent and abusive 
  practices. Laboratories must be vigilant about this and take appropriate steps 
  to prevent abuse. Thus, while laboratory compliance plans can permit the use 
  of standing orders executed in connection with an extended course of treatment, 
  the compliance plan should require the laboratory to monitor existing standing 
  orders to ensure their continuing validity. We suggest that, consistent with 
  State law requirements, a laboratory should contact all nursing homes from which 
  the laboratory has received such standing orders and request that they confirm 
  in writing the validity of all current standing orders. In addition, in accordance 
  with State law, laboratories should verify standing orders relied upon at draw 
  stations with the physician, physician's office staff, or such other persons 
  authorized by law to order tests who have provided the standing orders to the 
  laboratory. With respect to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, at least 
  once annually, laboratories should contact each ESRD facility or unit to request 
  confirmation in writing of the continued validity of all existing standing orders.</P>
<P> <b>5. Compliance with Applicable HHS OIG Fraud Alerts</b> </P>
<P>The HHS OIG periodically issues fraud alerts setting forth activities believed 
  to raise legal and enforcement issues. Laboratory compliance plans should require 
  that any and all fraud alerts issued by the OIG are carefully considered by 
  the legal staff, chief compliance officer, or other appropriate personnel. Moreover, 
  the compliance plans should require that a laboratory cease and correct any 
  conduct criticized in such a fraud alert, if applicable to laboratories, and 
  take reasonable action to prevent such conduct from recurring in the future. 
  If appropriate, a laboratory should take the steps described in Section G regarding 
  investigations, reporting and correction of identified problems. </P>
<P> <b>6. Marketing</b> </P>
<P>Laboratory compliance plans should require honest, straightforward, fully informative 
  and non-deceptive marketing. It is in the best interests of patients, physicians, 
  laboratories and Medicare alike that physicians fully understand the services 
  offered by the laboratory, the services that will be provided when tests are 
  ordered, and the financial consequences for Medicare, as well as other payers, 
  for the tests ordered. Accordingly, laboratories that market their services 
  should ensure that their marketing information is clear, correct, non-deceptive 
  and fully informative.</P>
<P> <b>7. Prices Charged Physicians for Profiles</b> </P>
<P>Laboratories are paid for their services by a variety of payers in addition 
  to Medicare and other federally funded health care programs. Such payers often 
  include health insurers, other health care providers, and physicians. The prices 
  that laboratories charge, particularly to physicians and especially for profiles, 
  raise compliance issues that should be addressed in a laboratory's written compliance 
  policies. Such compliance policies should ensure that as tests are included 
  in or added to profiles, the price for the enhanced profile increases and the 
  overall price for the profile is never below cost. Laboratories that do not 
  increase the price to a doctor for an enhanced profile or that charge below 
  cost for an enhanced profile and then bill Medicare or another federally funded 
  health care program the full third-party price for the profile components will 
  be risking false claims and kickback enforcement actions.</P>
<P> <b>8. Retention of Records</b> </P>
<P>Compliance programs should ensure that all records required either by Federal 
  or State law or by the compliance plan are created and maintained. One of the 
  best ways to confirm that a compliance plan is effective is through reports 
  that reflect results. The creation of such documents will reach this goal, but 
  it may also raise a variety of legal issues, such as patient privacy and confidentiality. 
  These issues are best discussed with legal counsel. </P>
<P> <b>9. Compliance As An Element of a Performance Plan</b> </P>
<P>To ensure that corporate integrity rises to the level of importance required 
  of laboratories participating in Medicare or other federally funded health care 
  programs, compliance programs should require that the promotion of and adherence 
  to compliance be an element in evaluating the performance of managers and supervisors. 
  They, along with other employees, should be periodically trained in new compliance 
  policies and procedures. In addition, all managers and supervisors involved 
  in the sale, marketing, or billing of laboratory services, and those who oversee 
  phlebotomists should: (1) discuss with all supervised employees the compliance 
  policies and legal requirements applicable to their function; (2) inform all 
  supervised personnel that strict compliance with these policies and requirements 
  is a condition of employment; and (3) disclose to all supervised personnel that 
  the laboratory will take disciplinary action up to and including termination 
  for violation of these policies or requirements. In addition to making performance 
  of these duties an element in evaluations, the compliance officer or laboratory 
  management may also chose to include in the laboratory's compliance plan a policy 
  that managers and supervisors may be sanctioned for failure to adequately instruct 
  their subordinates or for failing to detect non-compliance with applicable policies 
  and legal requirements, where reasonable diligence on the part of the manager 
  or supervisor would have led to the discovery of any problems or violations 
  and given the laboratory the opportunity to correct them earlier.</P>
<H4>B. DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE OFFICER (OR EQUIVALENT)</H4>
<P> Every laboratory compliance plan should require the designation of a chief 
  compliance officer or an equivalent (e.g., committee). This individual should 
  be responsible for developing compliance policies and standards, overseeing 
  and monitoring the company's compliance activities, and achieving and maintaining 
  compliance. The individual should be delegated sufficient authority by the Board 
  of Directors (or other governing body) to undertake and comply with these responsibilities 
  and should have open access to senior management and the governing body. Further, 
  the chief compliance officer should develop and distribute to appropriate individuals 
  all written compliance policies and procedures. These policies and procedures 
  should be readily understandable by all employees (e.g., translated into other 
  languages, if necessary) and at a minimum, should address the issues discussed 
  herein.</P>
<H4>C. EDUCATION AND TRAINING</H4>
<P>Laboratory compliance programs should require compliance and ethics training 
  for all employees, especially personnel involved in billing, sales, marketing 
  and specimen collection and/or test ordering. Such training should emphasize 
  the company's commitment to compliance with all laws, regulations and guidelines 
  of Federal and State programs. Training should be conducted at least annually 
  and repeated at regularly scheduled times, using a variety of teaching methods 
  and where appropriate, languages to ensure that all employees fully comprehend 
  the implications of failing to comply with the laboratory's compliance plan 
  and all applicable health care program requirements. The training and education 
  program should cover the laboratory's compliance policies and should reinforce 
  the fact that strict compliance with the law and laboratory policies is a condition 
  of employment. Employees should be informed that failure to comply may result 
  in disciplinary action, including termination. Training of sales and marketing 
  personnel should highlight the prohibition against offering remuneration in 
  return for referrals, and the fact that the laboratory will take appropriate 
  disciplinary action up to and including termination for violations of the laws 
  or failure to report a potential violation by another employee, supervisor or 
  outside contractor or provider. </P>
<P>In addition to compliance and ethics training, we believe that laboratory compliance 
  plans also should address the need for periodic continuing education, which 
  may be required by law or regulation for certain laboratory personnel, such 
  as phlebotomists and laboratory technicians. Continuing education programs of 
  this type will help ensure a knowledgeable and more productive staff.</P>
<P>Laboratory compliance programs should leave no doubt in the minds of employees 
  and others who are associated with the provider about the company's commitment 
  to compliance with all laws, regulations and guidelines governing federally 
  funded health care programs. Compliance should be one of the company's most 
  important priorities. In addition to the compliance and ethics training and 
  continuing education programs, a simple way to re-emphasize this message is 
  to post in common work areas and other prominent places accessible to all employees 
  a notice clearly reminding employees of the laboratory's commitment to compliance 
  with all laws and regulations.</P>
<H4>D. COMMUNICATION</H4>
<P> <B>1. Access to the Compliance Officer</B> </P>
<P>An open line of communication between the compliance officer and his or her 
  staff is critical to the successful implementation and operation of a compliance 
  program. If fraud and abuse is going to be reduced, there should be an open 
  door, complete anonymity, non-retribution policy available to all employees 
  to encourage communication. Working with or through the legal department can 
  clarify the gray areas of interpretation of Medicare and Medicaid guidelines 
  and regulations, but in all cases, the laboratory should encourage employees 
  not to guess, but to ask if there is confusion or a question. Where appropriate, 
  awards for reporting violations should be available.</P>
<P> <B>2. Hotline</B> </P>
<P>There are many vehicles for developing a line of communication between the 
  employee and the compliance office. Hotlines, e-mails, and written memoranda 
  are examples of just a few. We suggest that laboratories make available to all 
  employees a hotline telephone number which can be used to anonymously report 
  suspected misconduct. Laboratories using a hotline should post in common work 
  areas notices describing the hotline and providing the telephone number. Matters 
  reported through the hotline that suggest violations of compliance policies 
  or legal requirements should be investigated immediately to determine their 
  veracity. </P>
<H4>E. AUDITING AND MONITORING</H4>
<P>The OIG will be critical of compliance plans and programs that exist on paper 
  but are not earnestly implemented or enforced. In addition to education and 
  training programs, policies, and notices, a successful compliance program should 
  require the thorough monitoring of its implementation and regular reporting 
  to senior executives and members of the Board of Directors. Although many monitoring 
  techniques are available, an effective tool to ensure enforcement is the performance 
  of regular, periodic audits of the laboratory's operations, with particular 
  attention paid to billing, sales, marketing, notices and disclosures to physicians, 
  requisition forms, pricing, and activities of phlebotomists and others involved 
  in the ordering of laboratory services. Such audits should be designed and implemented 
  to ensure compliance with the laboratory's compliance policies, the laboratory's 
  compliance plan, and all applicable Federal and State laws. In addition, auditing 
  should address issues related to contracts, competitive practices, marketing 
  materials, CPT/HCPCS coding and billing, test information, reporting and record 
  keeping. </P>
<P>Quality assurance and zero tolerance of fraud and abuse should be the goal 
  of the compliance division, and we believe that auditing is a good tool to use 
  to reach that goal. Compliance audits should be conducted in accordance with 
  pre-established comprehensive audit procedures and should include, at a minimum: 
  (1) on-site visits; (2) interviews with personnel involved in management, operations, 
  billing, sales, marketing, and other related activities; (3) reviews of written 
  materials and documentation used by the laboratory; and (4) trend analysis studies. 
  Formal audit reports should be prepared and submitted to the chief compliance 
  officer and the Board of Directors or other governing body to ensure that laboratory 
  management is aware of the results and can take whatever steps necessary to 
  correct past problems and deter them from recurring. We suggest that the audit 
  or other analytical reports specifically identify areas where corrective actions 
  are needed. In certain cases, subsequent audits or studies would be advisable 
  to ensure that the recommended corrective actions have been implemented and 
  are successful. </P>
<H4>F. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</H4>
<P>A viable compliance program must include the initiation of corrective and/or 
  disciplinary action against individuals who have failed to comply with the laboratory's 
  compliance policies and/or Federal or State laws or who have otherwise engaged 
  in wrongdoing that has the potential of impairing the laboratory's status as 
  a reliable, honest, trustworthy provider. The compliance program should include 
  a written policy statement setting forth the degrees of disciplinary actions 
  that can be imposed upon employees for failing to comply with the company's 
  code of conduct, company policies, and the law. Employees must be advised and 
  convinced that disciplinary action will be taken, and punishments enforced, 
  for a discipline policy to have the required deterrent effect.</P>
<H4>G. CORRECTIVE ACTION</H4>
<B> 
<P>1. Investigating, Reporting and Correcting Identified Problems</P>
</B> 
<P>a. <I> Investigation</I>: Violations of a laboratory's compliance program, 
  failures to comply with Federal and/or State law, and other types of misconduct 
  threaten a laboratory's status as a reliable, honest and trustworthy provider 
  capable of participating in federally funded health care programs. Consequently, 
  laboratory compliance programs should require that when the chief compliance 
  officer or others involved in management of a laboratory learn of potential 
  violations or misconduct, they promptly investigate the matter to determine 
  whether a material violation has in fact occurred, so that if a violation has 
  occurred, management can take steps to rectify it, report it to the government 
  if necessary, and make any appropriate payments to the government. Depending 
  on the nature of the allegations, the investigation into allegations of wrongdoing 
  or misconduct will probably include interviews and review of relevant documents, 
  such as submitted claims, test requisition forms, and laboratory test reports. 
  Some laboratories may wish to engage outside auditors or counsel to assist them 
  with the investigation. </P>
<P>If an investigation of an alleged violation is undertaken and the compliance 
  officer believes the integrity of the investigation may be at stake because 
  of the presence of employees under investigation, the employee(s) allegedly 
  involved in the misconduct probably should be removed from his/her current work 
  activity until the investigation is completed. In addition, the laboratory should 
  take steps to prevent the destruction of documents or other evidence relevant 
  to the investigation. Once an investigation is completed, if disciplinary action 
  is warranted, it should be immediate and imposed in accordance with the company's 
  written standards of disciplinary action.</P>
<P>b. <I> Reporting</I>: If management receives credible evidence of misconduct 
  from any source and, after appropriate investigative inquiry, has reasonable 
  grounds to believe that the misconduct either: (a) violates criminal law, or 
  (b) constitutes a material violation of the civil law, rules and regulations 
  governing federally funded health care programs, then the laboratory should 
  report the existence of the misconduct to the OIG as soon as possible. The OIG 
  recommends that the laboratory give notice to the OIG of this type of misconduct 
  within sixty (60) days after receipt of the credible evidence of misconduct. 
  Such prompt reporting will demonstrate the laboratory's good faith and willingness 
  to work with the government to correct and remedy the problem. </P>
<P>When reporting misconduct to the government, a laboratory should give the OIG 
  any evidence relating to the misconduct that the laboratory has, including evidence 
  disclosed to the laboratory from another source. The laboratory then should 
  continue to investigate the reported violation, and once finished, should notify 
  DOJ and the OIG of the outcome of the investigation, including a description 
  of the effect of the misconduct on the operation of federally funded health 
  care programs or their beneficiaries. If the investigation ultimately reveals 
  that criminal activity may have occurred, the appropriate State or Federal authorities 
  should be notified immediately. As discussed below, the laboratory should also 
  take appropriate corrective action, including prompt restitution of any damages 
  to the government and the imposition of appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
<P>c. <I>Corrective Action</I>: If the investigation reveals that misconduct did 
  occur, corrective actions should be immediately initiated. For instance, if 
  the investigation reveals that the laboratory has received overpayments, the 
  laboratory should make prompt restitution of such sums to the appropriate federally 
  funded health care program. Failure to repay the overpayment immediately could 
  be interpreted as an intentional attempt to hide the overpayment from the government. 
  For that reason, laboratory compliance programs and written policies and procedures 
  should emphasize that monies to which the laboratory had no legal entitlement 
  in the first place may not be legally retained and must be returned immediately. 
  In addition to making prompt restitution and taking corrective action, the laboratory 
  should take whatever disciplinary action is necessary to cure the problems identified 
  by the investigation and prevent it from happening again. </P>
<B> 
<P>2. Non-Employment or Retention of Sanctioned Individuals</P>
</B> 
<P>Compliance programs should prohibit the employment of individuals who have 
  been convicted of a criminal offense related to health care or who are listed 
  by a Federal agency as debarred, excluded or otherwise ineligible for participation 
  in federally funded health care programs. In addition, until resolution of such 
  criminal charges or proposed debarment or exclusion, individuals who are charged 
  with criminal offenses related to health care or proposed for exclusion or debarment 
  should be removed from direct responsibility for or involvement in any federally 
  funded health care program. If resolution results in conviction, debarment or 
  exclusion of the individual, the laboratory should terminate its employment 
  of that individual or company. </P>
<center>
  <H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
</center>
<P>These basic recommended elements coupled with other published regulations and 
  guidelines are the foundation for a comprehensive compliance plan for clinical 
  laboratories. On advice from in-house counsel and senior management, clinical 
  laboratories should add to or modify these elements to better reflect the corporate 
  structure of the laboratory, its mission, and its employee composition. The 
  OIG believes that by implementing an effective compliance plan, a laboratory 
  will achieve better quality control of claims submission and reduce the risk 
  of future criminal and civil liabilities.</P>
