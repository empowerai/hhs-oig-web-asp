<p>HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today marked the first-year anniversary of HHS' 
  anti-fraud initiative, Operation Restore Trust, saying new approaches in the 
  pilot program have already produced $42.3 million in recoveries. This constitutes 
  a return of $10 in recoveries for every $1 spent on the project. </p>
<p>The pilot project is operating in five states, and the Clinton Administration 
  has proposed expanding it to all 50 states in the coming fiscal year. </p>
<p>&quot;Operation Restore Trust has pioneered new partnerships within the federal 
  government, new cooperation with states, and new ways of targeting and stopping 
  fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,&quot; Secretary Shalala said. &quot;In 
  its first year, Operation Restore Trust has proved its value, and the President 
  wants to extend its reach to every state in the nation.&quot; </p>
<p>With first-year targeted demonstration project funds of $4.09 million, Operation 
  Restore Trust has produced $42.3 million in restitutions, fines, settlements 
  and recovery of overpayments. This includes $24.5 million returning to the Medicare 
  Trust Fund from criminal restitutions, fines and recoveries; $14.1 million returning 
  to the Trust Fund as a result of civil judgments, settlements and penalties; 
  and $3.7 million returned to the Treasury as a result of services inappropriately 
  billed or medically unnecessary services rendered. </p>
<p>HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said that &quot;Operation Restore Trust 
  is proving what it was meant to prove: that a new focus on fraud and abuse, 
  and new cooperative approaches, can help us to better protect federal Medicare 
  and Medicaid dollars.&quot; </p>
<p>The initiative was announced by President Clinton last May at the White House 
  Conference on Aging. It is aimed specifically at fraud, waste and abuse in three 
  high-growth areas of Medicare and Medicaid: home health agencies, nursing homes, 
  and durable medical equipment suppliers. </p>
<p>Inspector General Brown said that out of 272 Medicare and Medicaid cases currently 
  under investigation in the three targeted payment areas, 244 are new cases that 
  were opened as a result of the Operation Restore Trust initiative. She said 
  64 of the cases are joint efforts with other law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>Operation Restore Trust is focused on five states (New York, Florida, Illinois, 
  Texas, and California) which account for 38.5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries 
  and 34 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>New approaches being tried under the initiative include: </p>
<p>Use of sophisticated statistical methods to target providers for investigations 
  and audit </p>
<p>Use of teams of HCFA data staff, IG auditors and nurses from state agencies 
  to conduct comprehensive reviews of rehab and skilled nursing facilities with 
  unusually high Medicare reimbursement rates. Reviews looked both at facility-specific 
  issues as well as potential systemic problems</p>
<p>Increased emphasis on concerted planning and executing of investigations with 
  the Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies </p>
<p>Use of public forums both to disseminate information to beneficiaries and providers 
  about known fraudulent techniques, and to gather information from them </p>
<p>Training and empowering state Aging Ombudsmen to detect and report fraud and 
  abuse in nursing homes </p>
<p>Use of state survey officials who regularly monitor care in home health agencies 
  to help identify inappropriate and fraudulent billing (see separate press release). 
</p>
<p>Other accomplishments during the first year include: </p>
<p>o 35 criminal convictions and 18 civil judgments have been obtained since March 
  1, 1995, in cases folded into the ORT project and benefiting from the increased 
  attention, focus, and support provided by ORT. In addition, 93 program exclusions 
  of individuals and corporations have been taken. </p>
<p>o A new HCFA satellite office has been established in Miami which, in addition 
  to its other activities, is heavily involved in outreach to the local community 
  to alert the public and local businesses to health care fraud schemes. </p>
<p>o A toll-free Hotline (&quot;HHS-TIPS&quot;) has been established to receive 
  information on possible waste, fraud and abuse. </p>
<p>Bruce Vladeck, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, said, 
  &quot;The object of Operation Restore Trust is not only to punish fraud and 
  abuse, and to recover funds, but more important to identify areas of vulnerability 
  and prevent fraud before it happens.&quot; </p>
<p>Vladeck said that a number of significant potential program changes have been 
  identified as a result of Operation Restore Trust, which could result in substantial 
  savings by preventing fraud, waste and abuse before they occur. The potential 
  changes are being developed as legislative, regulatory, and administrative actions. 
</p>
<p>The HHS Office of Inspector General, the Health Care Financing Administration 
  and the Administration on Aging are the three agencies within HHS which are 
  jointly carrying out the Operation Restore Trust initiative. The project has 
  also involved an intergovernmental team comprised of federal and state personnel, 
  including the Department of Justice and the United States Attorneys' offices 
  across the country. </p>
<p>HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging Fernando Torres-Gil said, &quot;Seniors are 
  among the most vulnerable persons to be targeted by unscrupulous health care 
  providers. It is up to us to educate and inform them and others of fraudulent 
  practices so that critically needed services and programs are there for them 
  and future generations when they are needed.&quot; </p>
<p>Services targeted by Operation Restore Trust were chosen because they are three 
  of the fastest-growing cost areas in Medicare and Medicaid. </p>
<p>Under President Clinton's FY 1997 budget proposal, the approaches successfully 
  piloted in the demonstration project would become part of a nationwide initiative. 
  The President's budget also contains proposals for providing increased and more 
  stable funding for anti-fraud efforts in Medicare and Medicaid. Altogether the 
  President's proposals for a nationwide anti-fraud initiative for Medicare and 
  Medicaid would involve FY 1997 spending of $597 million, an increase of $158 
  million over current funding levels. The total saving expected from the additional 
  spending is $3.5 billion over seven years (1997-2003). </p>
