  SUBJECT: Hospital Firm Pays $12.6 Million to Settle Kickback Allegations </p>
<hr>
<p>Inspector General June Gibbs Brown announced that OrNda Healthcorp has agreed 
  to pay the Federal Government more than $12.6 million to settle allegations 
  that several of its hospitals paid physicians for Medicare patient referrals 
  and received referrals from physicians with whom it had improper financial relationships. 
  The hospitals, which were primarily located in California, submitted Medicare 
  claims for patients improperly referred by doctors who received kickbacks. Some 
  physicians were paid as &quot;directors&quot; of hospital programs that did 
  not exist; others were paid for services not needed or not performed.</p>
<p>OrNda, which is based in Tennessee, was acquired in January 1997 by California-based 
  Tenet Healthcare Corporation, the second largest investor-owned health care 
  services company in the country. Tenet is part of the settlement agreement only 
  because it became the successor in interest to OrNda. The agreement contains 
  no admission of guilt by either company, nor does it resolve any potential claims 
  against the physicians involved. </p>
<p>The settlement resolves a law suit brought by a former surgeon of one of the 
  hospitals, in which the Government elected to intervene. He will receive more 
  than $2.3 million of the recovery, along with an additional sum to resolve personal 
  claims against OrNda.</p>
