  Civil Money Penalty Safe Harbor to Protect Payment of Medicare<br>
  Supplemental Insurance and Medigap Premiums for ESRD Beneficiaries</strong> 
<p><strong>AGENCY:</strong> Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS. 
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Notice of proposed rulemaking. 
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> In accordance with section 5201 of the Omnibus Consolidated 
  and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, this proposed 
  rule would set forth in the OIG's civil money penalty provisions in 42 CFR part 
  1003 a new safe harbor for unlawful inducements to beneficiaries to provide 
  protection for independent dialysis facilities that pay, in whole or in part, 
  premiums for Supplementary Medical Insurance (Medicare Part B) or Medicare Supplemental 
  Health Insurance policies (Medigap) for financially needy Medicare beneficiaries 
  with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This safe harbor would specifically establish 
  various standards and guidelines that, if met, would result in the particular 
  arrangement being protected from civil sanctions under section 1128A(a)(5) of 
  the Social Security Act. 
<p><strong>DATES:</strong> To assure consideration, public comments on this proposed 
  rule must be delivered to the address provided below by no later than 4:30 p.m. 
  on [60 days from date of publication in the <u>Federal Register</u>]. 
<p><strong>ADDRESSES:</strong> Please mail or deliver your written comments to

<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> 
<p><strong>I. Background</strong> 
<p><u>A. Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act </u> 
<p> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public 
  Law 104-191, amended the Social Security Act (Act) to prohibit providers from 
  offering patients any inducement to order or receive items or services from 
  a particular provider, practitioner or supplier. Specifically, section 231(h) 
  of HIPAA established a new provision - section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act - to provide 
  for the imposition of a civil money penalty (CMP) against any person who:&nbsp; 
<p style="margin-left: 50; margin-right: 50"> "offers or transfers remuneration 
  to any individual eligible for benefits under [Medicare or Medicaid] that such 
  person knows or should know is likely to influence such individual to order 
  or receive from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier any item or 
  service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under [Medicare 
  or Medicaid]." 
<p> Section 231(h) of HIPAA also created a new section 1128A(i)(6) of the Act 
  to define the term "remuneration" for purposes of the new CMP. The section defines 
  "remuneration," in relevant part, as "transfers of items or services for free 
  or for other than fair market value." Remuneration does not include certain 
  enumerated practices, including waivers of coinsurance and deductible amounts, 
  if the waiver: (1) is not advertised; (2) is not routinely offered; and (3) 
  is made following an individualized good faith assessment of financial need 
  or is made after reasonable efforts to collect the coinsurance or deductible 
  amounts have failed. There is no exception for the payment of Medicare Part 
  B or Medigap insurance premiums on behalf of beneficiaries even when the same 
  criteria are met. 
<p> On October 21, 1998, Congress enacted the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency 
  Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (OCESAA), Public Law 105-277. 
  Section 5201 of OCESAA specifically authorized the Secretary to issue regulations 
  establishing "safe harbors" under section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act for payment 
  practices that would otherwise run afoul of the statute. (In addition to this 
  provision, the Secretary is vested with the authority to issue advisory opinions 
  providing legal and regulatory guidance to providers under this section.) With 
  respect to the payment of Medicare Part B and Medigap premiums for ESRD patients, 
  Congress required any exception to be established through a rulemaking process 
  and limited it to the two-year period beginning on the date the final rule is 
  promulgated. In addition, if the Secretary promulgates a safe harbor for ESRD 
  premiums, Congress required the Comptroller General of the United States to 
  conduct a study of any disproportionate impact on specific issuers of Medigap 
  insurance policies due to adverse selection in enrolling Medicare ESRD beneficiaries. 
  The Comptroller report would include a recommendation as to whether the time 
  limit on the safe harbor should be extended. 
<p><u>B. End-Stage Renal Disease and Medicare's Dialysis Benefit</u> 
<p> End-stage renal disease is a chronic disease that requires regular renal replacement 
  therapy, such as dialysis treatments, as well as regular monitoring of laboratory 
  values, diet and medication. In addition to irreversible renal failure, ESRD 
  patients commonly suffer from certain co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes, 
  anemia, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Without ongoing dialysis 
  treatment or a transplant, ESRD is a fatal condition. End-stage renal disease 
  affects a disproportionate share of minority populations that also have a higher 
  than average incidence of poverty. 
<p> In 1978, Congress amended title 11 of the Act to create a special Medicare 
  benefit under Public Law 95-292 for eligible individuals with ESRD (or dependents 
  of those who are eligible). In accordance with section 226A of the Act, eligible 
  persons are entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A and are eligible to enroll 
  under Part B of the Medicare program. End-stage renal disease benefits include 
  all Part A and Part B items and services covered under the Medicare program, 
  and ESRD beneficiaries are subject to all the regular deductible, premium and 
  coinsurance provisions of Part A and Part B. 
<p> Medicare pays a composite rate to dialysis facilities for each dialysis treatment. 
  The composite rate includes: (1) medically necessary dialysis equipment, (2) 
  home dialysis support services, (3) all necessary dialysis supplies, (4) routine 
  ESRD-related laboratory tests and (5) all dialysis services furnished by the 
  dialysis facility's staff. Certain other ESRD services, such as non-routine 
  laboratory tests, may be paid to the facility outside of the composite rate. 
<p> Medicare Part B payments generally cover 80 percent of the composite rate. 
  End-stage renal disease patients are responsible for the remaining 20 percent 
  coinsurance and any deductibles. Typically, ESRD patients are responsible for 
  approximately $5,000 per year in coinsurance for their dialysis treatments alone. 
  This amount does not include the cost of coinsurance associated with hospital 
  and physician services. In addition, ESRD patients must pay for a number of 
  related drugs that are not covered by Medicare. On average the cost of Medigap 
  insurance can range from approximately $1,200 to $3,600, depending on what the 
  policy covers. 
<p><u>C. Effects of Section 1128A(a)(5) on the ESRD Population</u> 
<p> After the enactment of HIPAA, representatives of a number of ESRD providers 
  informed the OIG that many ESRD providers had been paying for Medicare Part 
  B premiums and Medigap policies for financially needy patients who could not 
  afford to purchase such insurance. Under the new statutory CMP provision, the 
  OIG concluded that such premium subsidies could be unlawful in many circumstances, 
  and dialysis providers subsequently suspended the purchase of Medigap policies 
  and payment of Medicare Part B premiums for their patients. However, some providers 
  entered into arrangements with nonprofit organizations that agreed to pay premiums 
  on behalf of needy ESRD patients. 
<p> To date, in accordance with statutory authority under section 1128D(b) of 
  the Act, the OIG has issued three advisory opinions approving the payment by 
  unrelated entities of insurance premiums for financially needy ESRD patients. 
  In the first opinion, the American Kidney Fund (AKF) - a <u>bona fide</u> section 
  501(c)(3) charitable and educational organization - and a number of dialysis 
  providers established an arrangement whereby providers make contributions to 
  the AKF which, in turn, independently screens candidates for financial need 
  and then pays Medicare Part B and Medigap premiums on behalf of qualifying patients<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. 
  We have indicated that this system does not violate the CMP provision because 
  the dialysis providers are not making payments to patients or on their patients' 
  behalf, and there is no "pass through" of specific payments to specific patients. 
  The two other advisory opinion requests, which were also approved, involved 
  a State-funded program and a Statewide program modeled on the AKF arrangement.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p> Providers claim that these new premium payment programs are unwieldy, create 
  delays and uncertainty for beneficiaries, and create unnecessary paperwork and 
  bureaucracy. In addition, the provider community has indicated that the risks 
  to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and to the patients do not appear to differ 
  significantly from when dialysis providers paid the premiums directly. 
<p><strong>II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule</strong> 
<p> We are proposing an exception to section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act for independent 
  dialysis facilities, as defined in 42 CFR 413.174, that pay for Medicare Part 
  B and Medigap premiums for financially needy ESRD patients when: 
<ul>
  <li>The payment is not advertised;</li>
  <li> The dialysis facility does not routinely make payments for such policies; 
    and</li>
  <li> The dialysis facility makes a good faith determination that the individual 
    is financially needy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protection would not extend to the payment of Medicare Part B or Medigap premiums 
  on behalf of any other beneficiaries (i.e., beneficiaries without ESRD) or by 
  any other provider, conduct which section 1128A(a)(5) of the Act specifically 
  prohibits. 
<p>The OIG is concerned that by offering to provide financial assistance to ESRD 
  patients as part of an advertisement or solicitation, providers might influence 
  a beneficiary's choice of provider. Therefore, to fit within the proposed exception, 
  independent dialysis facilities would have to refrain from advertising any offer 
  to make such payments. Without advertising the payment of premiums, the likelihood 
  increases that ESRD patients will have selected their dialysis provider prior 
  to receiving the offer of payment for Medicare Part B or Medigap premiums. 
<p> Moreover, we believe that it is inappropriate for health care providers to 
  pay Medicare Part B or Medigap premiums <u>routinely</u> on behalf of ESRD beneficiaries, 
  rather than to make payment decisions on a case-by-case basis. In this proposed 
  rule, we are not specifying any particular method of determining financial need, 
  since what may constitute "financial need" will vary depending on various factors 
  and circumstances. What is important is that providers make determinations of 
  financial need on an individualized, case-by-case basis in accordance with a 
  reasonable set of income guidelines uniformly applied in all cases. The guidelines 
  should be based on objective criteria and appropriate for the applicable locality. 
  We believe that it is not appropriate to apply inflated income guidelines that 
  result in waivers of copayments for persons not in genuine financial need. 
<p> <u>Limited applicability</u>. Despite the similarity of the criteria for the 
  proposed payment of premium safe harbor to the statutory criteria for the waiver 
  of copayment exception, we wish to emphasize that the proposed regulatory protection 
  would apply <u>only</u> to payments by independent dialysis facilities that 
  have no hospital, physician or other provider or supplier ownership. While waivers 
  of copayments are themselves suspect, the payment of insurance premiums by a 
  provider or supplier who is paid on a fee-for-service basis significantly increases 
  the incentive for overutilization and other abuse. 
<p> In the case of dialysis, providers are paid a prospectively fixed payment 
  for the dialysis services provided to each patient. Thus, there is less incentive 
  to overutilize or provide unnecessary services, notwithstanding the additional 
  insurance coverage. By contrast, we believe that a provider or supplier that 
  is treating a patient with a chronic condition on a fee-for-service basis has 
  a strong incentive to recoup its outlay for the premium by providing additional 
  services. In the case of a hospital-based dialysis facility or independent dialysis 
  facility in which a hospital, physician or other provider or supplier has an 
  ownership interest, we are concerned that these providers or suppliers would 
  have the same incentive as other providers or suppliers paid on a fee-for-service 
  basis, especially given the substantial amount of health care services required 
  by ESRD patients for co-morbid conditions. Accordingly, we are excluding from 
  this proposed exception hospital-based dialysis facilities and independent dialysis 
  facilities, owned in whole or in part by a hospital, physician or other provider 
  or supplier paid on a fee-for-service basis, and seek specific comments on this 
  exclusion from the exception. We are also concerned with the potential impact 
  of adverse selection on the Medigap insurance market, and seek specific comments 
  concerning the potential effects this provision may have on Medigap plans. 
<p><strong>III. Regulatory Impact Statement</strong> 
<p><u>Executive Order 12866, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Regulatory 
  Flexibility Act.</u>&nbsp; The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed 
  this proposed rule in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866 
  and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and has determined that 
  the rulemaking does not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action. 
  Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available 
  regulatory alternatives and, when rulemaking is necessary, to select regulatory 
  approaches that maximize net benefits, including potential economic, health 
  and equity effects. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (Public Law 104-4) requires 
  that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits on any 
  rulemaking that may result in an expenditure by State, local or tribal government, 
  or by the private sector of $100 million or more in any given year. In addition, 
  under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic effect 
  on a substantial number of small businesses, the Secretary must specifically 
  consider the economic effect of a rule on small business entities and analyze 
  regulatory options that could lessen the impact of the rule. 
<p> <u>Executive Order 12866</u>. Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations 
  reflect consideration of alternatives, costs, benefits, incentives, equity and 
  available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding 
  unnecessary burden. We believe that this proposed rule would have no significant 
  economic impact. The proposed safe harbor provision being set forth is designed 
  to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business practice and 
  arrangements that encourage competition, choice and economy. In doing so, the 
  rule would impose no requirements on any party. Independent dialysis facilities 
  may voluntarily seek to comply with this proposed provision so that their business 
  practice is not subject to enforcement actions under the civil money penalty 
  statute. Any aggregate economic effect of this safe harbor rule would be minimal, 
  allowing independent dialysis facilities to do directly what some dialysis facilities 
  are already allowed to do indirectly through the AKF (in accordance with OIG 
  Advisory Opinion 97-1). As such, we believe that the aggregate economic impact 
  of this proposed safe harbor rule would be minimal and would have no effect 
  on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures. 
<p> <u>Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</u>. Additionally, in accordance with the 
  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, since there are no significant costs associated 
  with this proposed safe harbor guideline that would impose any mandates on State, 
  local or tribal governments, or the private sector that would result in an expenditure 
  of $100 million or more in any given year, we have determined that a full analysis 
  under the Act is not necessary. 
<p> <u>Regulatory Flexibility Act</u>. In accordance with Regulatory Flexibility 
  Act (RFA) of 1980, and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996, 
  which amended the RFA, we have determined that this proposed rule would have 
  no significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. While 
  this proposed safe harbor may have an impact on some small entities, we believe 
  that the aggregate economic impact of this rulemaking should be minimal, since 
  it is the nature of a violation and not the size of the entity that determines 
  whether the OIG will pursue a sanction action. Since this proposed safe harbor 
  would offer individuals and entities greater flexibility in their business arrangements, 
  we believe that the proposed regulations should not have a significant economic 
  impact on a number of small business providers, and that a regulatory flexibility 
  analysis is not required for this rulemaking. 
<p><strong>IV. Public Inspection of Comments<br>
  </strong> <br wp="br1">
  Comments will be available for public inspection beginning on [2 weeks after 
  publication date in the <u>Federal Register</u>] in Room 5518 of the Office

<p>Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Grant programs - health, Health 
  facilities, Health professions, Maternal and child health, Medicare, Medicaid, 
  Penalties. 
<p> Accordingly, 42 CFR Part 1003 would be amended as set forth below: 
<p><strong>PART 1003 - [AMENDED]</strong> 
<p>Part 1003 would be amended as follows: 
<p>1. The authority citation for part 1003 would be revised to read as follows: 
<p> <strong>Authority:</strong> 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1320-7, 1320a-7a, 1320b-10, 1395u(j),

<p align="left"> For purposes of this part:&nbsp; 
<p align="left"> * * * * * 
<p align="left"> <u>Remuneration</u>, as set forth in &#167; 1003.102(b)(12) of 
  this part, is consistent with the definition contained in section 1128A(i)(6) 
  of the Act, and includes the waiver of coinsurance and deductible amounts (or 
  any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than
