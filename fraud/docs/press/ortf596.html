<p>Overview: Operation Restore Trust, the special HHS initiative against fraud, 
  waste and abuse, was launched by President Clinton in May 1995. It was designed 
  to demonstrate new partnerships and new approaches in finding and stopping fraud 
  in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. </p>
<p>As a demonstration project, Operation Restore Trust was targeted at three areas 
  of high spending growth: home health agencies, nursing homes and durable medical 
  equipment suppliers. The efforts were targeted at five states comprising more 
  than a third of all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries: New York, Florida, 
  Illinois, Texas and California. </p>
<p>Special objectives for Operation Restore Trust included:</p>
<p>o Identify and penalize those who willfully defraud the Medicare and Medicaid 
  programs</p>
<p>o Identify systemic problems and special vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse 
  in the Medicare and Medicaid programs</p>
<p>o Alter the public and health care sector to health care fraud schemes</p>
<p>o Demonstrate a new effort which provides especially for voluntary disclosure 
  of evidence of fraud.</p>
<p>Milestones have been reached in each of the objective areas, and the Clinton 
  Administration plans to expand its reach to every State in the nation. </p>
<p><b>Objective: Identify, investigate and penalize those entities who willfully 
  defraud the Government.</b> </p>
<p><i>Accomplishments After One Year:</i> </p>
<p>o Over $24.5 million are making their way back into the Medicare Trust Fund 
  as a result of court ordered criminal restitutions, fines, and recoveries.</p>
<p>o $14.1 million are making their way back into the Trust Fund as a result of 
  civil judgements, settlements and civil monetary penalties.</p>
<p>o 272 cases are currently under investigation, most of which could never have 
  been pursued without the stable source of funding project ORT has provided. 
  244 of these are new cases that were opened as a result of the Operation Restore 
  Trust initiative.</p>
<p>- 64 of these cases are joint efforts with other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>o 35 criminal convictions and 18 civil judgements have been obtained since 
  March 1, 1995, in cases folded into the ORT project and benefiting from the 
  increased attention, focus, and support provided by ORT.</p>
<p>o 93 program exclusions of individuals and corporations have been taken.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>o Frank Aiello, a nursing home owner and operator in California, was found 
  guilty and sentenced on 28 counts relating to a multi-million dollar Medicare 
  fraud scheme. Aiello billed Medicare approximately $3.5 million for nonexistent 
  medical supplies for his nursing home, and filed false cost reports. Aiello 
  also gave gratuities to two intermediary employees to avoid adverse audit findings. 
  In January 1996, Aiello was sentenced to 11 years, 3 months in jail, ordered 
  to pay $3,248,008 in restitution, fined $300,000, and ordered to pay a special 
  assessment of $1,400. Three other individuals were also convicted and sentenced 
  in connection with the scheme.</p>
<p>o On March 5, 1996, formerly licensed psychiatrist Thomas Sargeant was sentenced 
  in California to 18 months in prison and ordered to perform community service 
  in lieu of restitution for defrauding Medicare. Sargeant billed Medicare more 
  than $100,000 for fictitious psychotherapy services to nursing home patients. 
</p>
<p>o U.S. HomeCare, a home health agency in Florida, signed an agreement to pay 
  $650,000 to the Government. It was alleged that HomeCare knowingly submitted 
  or caused to be submitted claims for payment under Medicare for home health 
  services in violation of the False Claims Act. HomeCare did this through a series 
  of subcontracts with home and other health care services on behalf of HomeCare. 
  Subcontractors would bill HomeCare and HomeCare would fraudulently bill Medicare. 
  In the event of default by HomeCare on its obligations, the Government may at 
  any time and at its option exclude HomeCare from participation in the Medicare 
  program and all State health care programs. </p>
<p><b>Objective: Identify problems of noncompliance with existing statutes and 
  regulations; and identify systematic problems relating to program effectiveness 
  and efficiency, and vulnerabilities to fraud and abuse.</b> </p>
<p><i>Accomplishments After One Year:</i> </p>
<p>o $3.7 million returned to the Treasury as a result of services inappropriately 
  billed to ineligible persons, or medically unnecessary services rendered. </p>
<p>o Identified substantial amount of Trust Fund money that could be saved through 
  program changes preventing fraud, waste and abuse--action the Administration 
  is now considering for possible legislative, regulatory, and administrative 
  proposals. </p>
<p>o New methods are being tested to involve State and local officials at the 
  grass roots level in identifying and reporting noncompliance.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>o An evaluation of variation in services claimed by home health agencies, and 
  a targeted compliance review in Florida, identified potential savings of at 
  least $5 billion over five years if new payment mechanisms and utilization controls 
  were implemented for the Medicare home health benefit.</p>
<p>o Evaluations of payments made for enteral nutrients and durable medical equipment 
  in nursing homes identified over $150 million in program savings possible from 
  management actions now being taken to improve coverage decisions and implementation 
  in those settings.</p>
<p>o An evaluation of payments for drugs used with nebulizers identified over 
  $50 million in program savings possible from management actions now in development 
  to improve Medicare's drug purchasing policies. These drugs are covered under 
  the Medicare program only in conjunction with durable medical equipment such 
  as nebulizers. Since such policies also would affect other drugs purchased by 
  Medicare, the total savings would be considerably more than that associated 
  with nebulizer drugs alone, demonstrating the very positive &quot;spillover&quot; 
  effects of Operation Restore Trust.</p>
<p>o Audits of three home health agencies in Florida identified $3.7 million in 
  potential disallowances of costs claimed by providers. In one home health agency, 
  auditors randomly selected for review 100 claims submitted for Medicare reimbursement 
  during the fiscal year ending December 31, 1993. These claims represent 2,068 
  home health services. The review showed that 40 claims, or 40 percent of our 
  sample, contained 846 services that did not meet Medicare guidelines for payment.</p>
<p>o HCFA developed an idea for innovative use of survey and certification staff 
  to identify fiscal as well as quality problems and tested the concept in Texas, 
  where it created 7 to 1 return in money recovered for the trust fund. In New 
  York, the same concept was applied in targeting five home health agencies for 
  review. Of fifty home health agency patients visited, nine patients were not 
  homebound and 20 patients were receiving unnecessary or overutilized services. 
  Many of the patients of one home health agency were residents of domiciliary 
  care facilities, with possible duplication of services. At least 1 durable medical 
  equipment supplier was providing excessive and/or unneeded supplies to home 
  health agency patients.</p>
<p>o Over 500 State and local ombudsmen have been trained to identify and report 
  suspected fraud, waste and abuse, a new process already resulting in referrals 
  to the OIG for investigation. </p>
<p><b>Objective: Alert the public and industry to health care fraud schemes.</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Accomplishments After One Year:</i> </p>
<p>o Two special fraud alerts and one consumer advisory have been issued to the 
  public and industry.</p>
<p>o A new hotline (1-800-HHS-TIPS) has been established, fielding over 30,000 
  calls from its inception, on a wide range of issues--not just those associated 
  specifically with Operation Restore Trust--demonstrating the &quot;spillover&quot; 
  effect of Project ORT. The Hotline has been promoted in and out of the ORT states 
  through press releases, flyers, public appearances of HHS officials, Congressional 
  correspondence, and Special Fraud Alerts.</p>
<p>o A new Miami satellite office has been established which, in addition to its 
  other activities, is heavily involved in outreach to the local community to 
  alert the public and local businesses to health care fraud schemes. The office, 
  with bilingual staff, conducts outreach and educational activities. Staff have 
  conducted an education campaign in the area, with meetings and briefings at 
  town centers, seniors centers and other sites where seniors congregate. Bilingual 
  flyers with the ORT 800-number and information about identified fraud scams 
  have been distributed to better inform beneficiaries, their families and various 
  organizations about specific fraud and abuse problems. </p>
<p><b>Objective: Allow for providers to voluntarily disclose evidence of fraud 
  that they have uncovered in their own organizations.</b> </p>
<p><i>Accomplishments After One Year:</i> </p>
<p>o A new Voluntary Disclosure Program has been established. Through this program, 
  the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has established procedures by which health 
  care providers in the home health and nursing home industries may come forward 
  with full disclosure of potential fraud and abuse for which the companies may 
  be liable. The voluntary disclosure program is also available to home health 
  and nursing home providers whose activities affect Medicare beneficiaries in 
  the 5 target states. The voluntary disclosure pilot will last for the duration 
  of the project.</p>
<p>In the first year of the voluntary disclosure program, the OIG has received 
  a significant number of inquiries from outside counsel about the program. In 
  several cases, the entity considering participation in the program did not qualify 
  because it was not in the industries or states that Operation Restore Trust 
  is targeting. Nonetheless, the entity came forward and, using the ORT disclosure 
  program as guidance, disclosed self-discovered evidence of program fraud. </p>
<p>The creation of a mechanism for cooperative self-disclosure has produced several 
  positive results. Through dialogue with health care industry representatives, 
  the OIG has gained new insight on what are the obstacles to identifying and 
  reporting incidents of program abuse. These insights will be used to reevaluate 
  the program and to strengthen it. Of equal importance, the introduction of the 
  concept of self-disclosure of fraud and abuse has presented new opportunities 
  for Government and industry collaboration in resolving problems. </p>

<p><b>OPERATION RESTORE TRUST BACKGROUND</b> </p>
<p><i>Overview:</i> </p>
<p>Operation Restore Trust is a two-year effort to combat health care fraud, waste 
  and abuse in the five states with the highest Medicare expenditures. The project 
  reached its mid-point and one-year anniversary on May 3, 1996.</p>
<p>In &quot;Operation Restore Trust,&quot; HHS designated an interdisciplinary 
  project team of federal and state government representatives to target Medicare 
  abuse and misuse in California, Florida, New York, Texas and Illinois. These 
  states account for 38.5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries and 34 percent of 
  Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
<p>The team is focusing on home health care, nursing home care, and medical equipment 
  and supplies, three of the fastest growing areas in Medicare. Three agencies 
  within HHS -- the Office of Inspector General, the Health Care Financing Administration, 
  and the Administration on Aging -- are involved, as is the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Health Care Programs Affected</p>
<p>The two health care programs covered by Operation Restore Trust are Medicare 
  and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Medicare is a federally administered program of health benefits for eligible 
  elderly and disabled persons. Some relevant statistics include:</p>
<p>Total Medicare enrollees for 1995 was 37.7 million persons. 12.7 million persons, 
  or 34 percent of the total Medicare enrollees, reside in the five Operation 
  Restore Trust States.</p>
<p>1995 Medicare outlays were an estimated $177.8 billion.</p>
<p>Medicaid is a state-administered program for eligible recipients, substantially 
  funded by federal government under title XIX of the Social Security Act. Some 
  relevant statistics include:</p>
<p>Total recipients for 1994 projected at 35.1 million persons nationally. Medicaid 
  recipients in Operation </p>
<p>Restore Trust States are 13.5 million, or 38.5 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Medicaid outlays for 1994 totaled $108.3 billion.</p>
<p>Areas of Focus Under Operation Restore Trust</p>
<p>Long-term Care Providers -- In 1995, there were 17,000 long-term care facilities 
  nationwide, including skilled nursing facilities reimbursed under Medicare and 
  nursing facilities reimbursed under state-administered Medicaid programs. </p>
<p>In 1994, Medicaid spent $27 billion for services to beneficiaries residing 
  in nursing facilities; $9.5 billion in Operation Restore Trust States.</p>
<p>In 1995, Medicare directly reimbursed skilled nursing facilities $7.3 billion 
  for care provided under the Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit. $2.7 
  billion was paid in Operation Restore Trust States.</p>
<p>Home Health Agencies -- Agencies are reimbursed by Medicare for certain services 
  provided to homebound beneficiaries. </p>
<p>In 1995, Medicare payments totalled about $14.5 billion; compared to $12.5 
  billion in 1994. $5.3 billion was paid in Operation Restore Trust States. </p>
<p>In 1994, Medicare made payments to 7,800 home health agencies. </p>
<p>Medical Equipment and Supplies -- Medicare reimburses suppliers for specified 
  items that are medically necessary for the care and treatment of illnesses of 
  beneficiaries enrolled in Part B. Payments are made by 5 regional carriers under 
  contract with the Health Care Financing Administration. Covered items include: 
  (1) durable medical equipment, e.g., wheelchairs, walkers, oxygen concentrators; 
  (2) prosthetic devices, (e.g., artificial limbs, catheters), and orthotic devices 
  (e.g., braces); (3) supplies used with durable medical equipment or prosthetics, 
  e.g., oxygen, cleaning solutions; and (4) supplies such as wound care dressings.</p>
<p>Medicare allowed about $4.5 billion in payments for medical equipment and supplies 
  in 1995. $1.6 billion was paid in Operation Restore Trust States.</p>
<p>Ongoing Activities in Operation Restore Trust</p>
<p>o Financial audits by OIG and HCFA contractors</p>
<p>o Criminal investigations and referrals by OIG to appropriate law enforcement 
  officials</p>
<p>o Civil and administrative sanction and recovery actions by OIG and other appropriate 
  law enforcement officials</p>
<p>o Surveys and inspections of long-term care facilities by HCFA and state officials</p>
<p>o Studies and recommendations by OIG and HCFA for program adjustments to prevent 
  fraud and reduce waste and abuse</p>
<p>o Issuance of Special Fraud Alerts to notify the public and the health care 
  community about schemes in the provision of home health services, nursing care 
  and medical equipment and supplies </p>
<p>o Fraud and abuse hotline </p>
<p>o Voluntary Disclosure Pilot Program</p>
<p>o Training of individuals within the aging network on how to identify and report 
  suspected fraud and abuse</p>
