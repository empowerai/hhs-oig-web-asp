<p align="center"><big><strong>Inspector General Issues Compliance Program Guidance 
  for Hospices</strong></big></p>
<p align="left">The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector 
  General today issued guidance to help hospice providers design effective voluntary 
  compliance programs to prevent fraud, waste and abuse in government health programs, 
  including Medicare and Medicaid. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;Encouraging the health care industry to adopt voluntary compliance programs 
  is an important prevention strategy to reduce the risk of fraud, waste and abuse 
  in federal health care programs,&quot; Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. 
  &quot;The guidance is intended for all hospice providers, whether for-profit 
  or nonprofit, large or small, urban or rural, with the expectation that each 
  hospice will tailor a compliance program to meet its particular needs.&quot; 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The guidance -- &quot;Compliance Program Guidance for Hospices&quot; -- was 
  first published in draft form in the July 21, 1999, <em>Federal Register</em> 
  and had a 30-day comment period. The final guidance will be published soon as 
  a <em>Federal Register</em> notice. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Similar to other guidance already issued by the Office of Inspector General 
  for clinical laboratories, hospitals, home health agencies, third-party medical 
  billing companies and durable medical equipment suppliers, the hospice guidance 
  is based on the following seven elements: 1) implementation of written policies, 
  procedures and standards of conduct; 2) designation of a compliance officer; 
  3) development of training and education programs; 4) creation of a hotline 
  or other measures for receiving complaints and procedures for protecting callers 
  from retaliation; 5) performance of internal audits to monitor compliance; 6) 
  enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary directives; and 
  7) prompt corrective action to detected offenses. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The guidance identifies specific compliance risk areas for hospice providers, 
  such as admitting patients to hospice care who are not terminally ill; underutilization 
  of services; improper arrangements with nursing homes; and high-pressure marketing 
  of hospice care to ineligible beneficiaries. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In fiscal year 1997, Medicare paid about $2 billion to provide hospice care 
  to about 375,000 beneficiaries. Hospice is a special way of caring for a patient 
  who is terminally ill. Patients receive a full scope of palliative medical and 
  support services for their terminal illnesses. Beneficiaries who elect hospice 
  care forego standard Medicare coverage for conditions related to the terminal 
  illness, but standard Medicare benefits are provided for conditions unrelated 
  to the patient's terminal illness. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  While many factors can influence when to admit patients to hospice care, it 
  is important to distinguish between admitting a patient to a hospice program 
  and certifying a patient for the Medicare hospice benefit. Based on an individual 
  hospice's admission criteria, some patients may be admitted to hospice care 
  prior to an estimated six months before death but without reimbursement under 
  the Medicare hospice benefit. By long-established law, patients can be certified 
  for the Medicare hospice benefit only when a physician determines that a patient's 
  life expectancy is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The hospice guidance also includes information on how to assess the effectiveness 
  of a compliance program. The government views the existence of a compliance 
  program as a mitigating factor in fraud and abuse cases only if the compliance 
  program is &quot;effective.&quot; <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Documentation is key to demonstrating the effectiveness of a provider's compliance 
  program. For example, the Office of Inspector General strongly recommends maintaining 
  documentation of the following: audit results; hotline calls and their resolution; 
  due diligence efforts of business transactions; employee training, including 
  the number of hours; disciplinary actions; and distribution of policies and 
  procedures. The documented practice of refunding overpayments and self-disclosing 
  incidents of non-compliance with federal health care program requirements can 
  also provide evidence of an effective compliance program. <br wp="br1">
