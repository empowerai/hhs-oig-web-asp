<p align="center"><strong>Inspector General Issues Final Compliance Program Guidance 
  for Nursing Facilities</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services' 
  Office of Inspector General today issued final guidance to help nursing facilities 
  design effective voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud, waste and abuse 
  in health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We encourage all nursing facilities 
  to adopt voluntary compliance programs, and we are issuing this guidance to 
  help the industry understand the government's expectations for a well-run compliance 
  program,&quot; Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Compliance with quality of care 
  standards is especially important for nursing facilities because nursing home 
  residents are often among the most vulnerable beneficiaries receiving care through 
  Medicare and Medicaid,&quot; Brown said, adding that nursing facilities should 
  pay particular attention to conducting background checks of potential employees 
  and contractors. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidance -- <em>Compliance Program 
  Guidance for Nursing Facilities</em> -- is scheduled for publication as a notice 
  in the Thursday, March 16, 2000, <em>Federal Register</em>. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to other guidance already issued 
  by the Office of Inspector General for clinical laboratories, hospitals, home 
  health agencies, third-party medical billing companies, durable-medical equipment 
  suppliers, hospices and Medicare+Choice organizations, the guidance is based 
  on the following seven elements: 1) implementation of written policies, procedures 
  and standards of conduct; 2) designation of a compliance officer; 3) development 
  of training and education programs; 4) creation of a hotline or other measures 
  for receiving complaints and procedures for protecting callers from retaliation; 
  5) performance of internal audits to monitor compliance; 6) enforcement of standards 
  through well-publicized disciplinary directives; and 7) prompt corrective action 
  in response to detected offenses. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Office of Inspector General recognizes 
  the complexities of the nursing home industry and is sensitive to the differences 
  among large national chains, regional multi-facility operators and small independent 
  homes. The guidance is intended for all nursing facilities whether for-profit 
  or nonprofit, large or small, urban or rural, with the expectation that each 
  nursing facility will tailor a compliance program to meet its particular needs. 
  Throughout the guidance there are suggestions on how small nursing facilities 
  can design effective voluntary compliance programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidance identifies specific compliance 
  risk areas for nursing facilities, including quality of care, residents' rights, 
  employee screening, vendor relationships, billing and cost reporting, and record 
  keeping and documentation. To safeguard against inappropriate practices, the 
  guidance recommends that nursing facilities, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure there is a comprehensive, accurate assessment of each resident's 
    functional capacity and a comprehensive care plan that includes measurable 
    objectives to meet residents' medical, mental and psychosocial needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Report incidents of mistreatment, neglect or abuse to the administrator 
    of the facility and other officials as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Refrain from discriminatory admissions or improper denial of care; verbal, 
    mental or physical abuse, corporal punishment and involuntary seclusion; and 
    inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Refrain from billing for items or services not rendered or provided as claimed; 
    submitting claims for equipment, medical supplies and services that are medically 
    unnecessary; submitting claims for items or services not ordered; and knowingly 
    billing for inadequate or substandard care.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Investigate the background of employees by checking with all applicable 
    licensing and certification authorities to verify that requisite licenses 
    and certifications are in order; and require all potential employees to certify 
    that they have not been convicted of an offense that would preclude employment 
    and that they are not excluded from participation in the federal health care 
    programs.<br>
    <br>
    The Office of Inspector General maintains a list of excluded individuals/entities 
    on the World Wide Web at <em>www.hhs.gov/oig/cumsan/index.htm</em> and recommends 
    that nursing facilities check the list before hiring or contracting with individuals 
    or entities. Additionally, the Office of Inspector General recommends that 
    nursing facilities periodically check the list to determine the exclusion 
    status of current employees and contractors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Refrain from routinely waiving coinsurance or deductible amounts without 
    a good faith determination that the resident is in financial need; and refrain 
    from soliciting or accepting any gift or gratuity of more than nominal value 
    from residents, potential referral sources and other individuals and entities 
    with which the nursing facility has a business relationship. Likewise, the 
    facility should refrain from offering any gift of more than nominal value 
    to residents or potential referral sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain all records and documentation, including billing and claims information, 
    required for participation in federal, state and private health care programs, 
    including the resident assessment instrument, the comprehensive plan of care 
    and all corrective actions taken in response to surveys.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nursing facility guidance also 
  includes information on how to assess the effectiveness of a compliance program. 
  The government views the existence of a compliance program as a mitigating factor 
  in fraud and abuse cases only if the compliance program is &quot;effective.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
