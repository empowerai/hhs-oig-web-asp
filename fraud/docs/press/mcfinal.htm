<p align="center"><big><strong>Inspector General Issues Final Compliance Program 
  Guidance</strong> <br>
  <strong>for Medicare+Choice Organizations</strong></big></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General today 
  issued final guidance to help Medicare+Choice managed care plans design effective 
  voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud, waste and abuse in government 
  health programs. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;Prevention is an essential element of the government's anti-fraud and 
  abuse campaign, and this voluntary guidance will help the managed care industry 
  understand the government's expectations for a well-run, effective compliance 
  program,&quot; Inspector General Brown said. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The guidance -- <em>Compliance Program Guidance for Medicare+Choice Organizations 
  Offering Coordinated Care Plans</em> -- was first published in draft form in 
  the June 24, 1999, <em>Federal Register</em> and had a 30-day comment period. 
  The final guidance will be published soon as a <em>Federal Register</em> notice. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;We are committed to providing guidance to the health care industry to 
  help providers comply with the law,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Since February 1997, 
  the Office of Inspector General has issued voluntary compliance guidance for 
  seven sectors of the health care industry -- clinical laboratories, hospitals, 
  home-health agencies, third-party medical billing companies, durable-medical 
  equipment suppliers, hospices and now for Medicare+Choice Organizations.&quot; 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Similar to other guidance already issued by the Office of Inspector General, 
  the Medicare+Choice guidance is based on the following seven elements: 1) implementation 
  of written policies, procedures and standards of conduct; 2) designation of 
  a compliance officer; 3) development of training and education programs; 4) 
  creation of a hotline or other measures for receiving complaints and procedures 
  for protecting callers from retaliation; 5) performance of internal audits to 
  monitor compliance; 6) enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary 
  directives; and 7) prompt corrective action to detected offenses. </p>
<p>While Medicare+Choice organizations are required by the Health Care Financing 
  Administration (HCFA) to have a compliance plan that includes the seven key 
  elements cited earlier, the regulation gives substantial discretion to the Medicare+Choice 
  organizations about how to implement the requirement. The Office of Inspector 
  General's guidance is voluntary and offers informal advice to Medicare+Choice 
  organizations in implementing their plans. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;We applaud the Inspector General for developing this guidance to encourage 
  plans to comply with federal requirements for marketing, enrolling and caring 
  for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare+Choice plans,&quot; 
  HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said. &quot;Plans can readily adapt the 
  elements of this guidance to meet Medicare's requirement that they maintain 
  an effective compliance program.&quot; <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The guidance identifies specific compliance risk areas for Medicare+Choice organizations, 
  including marketing practices; enrollment and disenrollment methods; underutilization 
  and quality of care; data collection and submission processes; the anti-kickback 
  statute and other inducements; and the provision of emergency services to enrollees. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  More than 6 million of Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries -- about 16 percent 
  -- are enrolled in Medicare+Choice coordinated care plans, which are paid a 
  fixed monthly amount for each beneficiary's care. Unlike traditional fee-for-service 
  Medicare, where the financial incentives can prompt the delivery of unneeded 
  care, the financial incentives for Medicare+Choice organizations are just the 
  opposite. To safeguard against inappropriate practices, the guidance recommends 
  that Medicare+Choice organizations, for example: 
<ul>
  <li>Take special care to ensure that all marketing materials are complete and 
    accurate and include information about the limits on beneficiaries' choice 
    of providers and that beneficiaries' enrollment in a specific plan can be 
    terminated if the plan or the government chooses not to renew its contract.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Refrain from marketing only to healthy beneficiaries -- known as &quot;cherry-picking&quot; 
    -- while avoiding beneficiaries with a high risk for costly or prolonged treatment 
    needs. Examples of inappropriate practices in this area include asking beneficiaries 
    medical questions before enrollment or holding marketing sessions for beneficiaries 
    at sites where healthy enrollees would be more likely to be present such as 
    health and exercise clubs.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that beneficiaries -- especially those with extensive care needs 
    -- are not encouraged to disenroll from the managed care plan.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that all necessary covered services are available and accessible 
    to all beneficiaries. Plans should also prohibit interference with health 
    professionals' advice to patients and make sure their physician payment arrangements 
    don't provide incentives to limit medically necessary care to any particular 
    enrollee.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure information submitted to the government -- especially information 
    associated with enrollment, encounters or payment -- is accurate, complete 
    and truthful.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Have policies in place to ensure that any arrangements with hospitals to 
    provide emergency services for beneficiaries don't interfere with requirements 
    for hospitals to provide screening and stabilizing treatment required by federal 
    law under the anti-dumping statute.</li>
</ul>
