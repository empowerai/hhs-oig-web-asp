  Corporate Integrity Agreement with Vencor, Inc.</font></strong> 
<p>June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services 
  (DHHS) announced today that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has entered 
  into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with Vencor, Inc., one of the nation's 
  largest operators of nursing homes and hospital services. Under the agreement, 
  which is unprecedented in its focus on ensuring excellence in the delivery of 
  long-term care, Vencor will adopt a comprehensive internal quality improvement 
  program at the corporate, regional and facility levels. The agreement with the 
  OIG resolves in part the ongoing investigations by the OIG and the Department 
  of Justice involving allegations of poor quality of care and billing abuses 
  at Vencor. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The OIG imposes compliance obligations on health care providers when negotiating 
  its settlements of Federal health care program investigations arising under 
  a variety of false claims statutes. A provider consents to these obligations 
  as part of the civil settlement and/or in exchange for the OIG's agreement not 
  to exclude that health care provider from participation in Medicare, Medicaid 
  and other Federal health care programs. This administrative sanction is based 
  on the OIG's authority to exclude providers who have submitted false claims 
  to these programs. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Vencor CIA is for a term of five years and requires the company to implement 
  a variety of compliance measures to ensure the integrity of Federal health care 
  program claims submitted by the provider. Modeled after the recently released 
  OIG "Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities," the agreement addresses 
  the quality of care delivered to residents and patients, as well as promotes 
  compliance with the Federal health care program requirements. In addition to 
  creating a quality assurance infrastructure, Vencor will engage a team of independent 
  monitors selected by the OIG to provide an ongoing assessment of these systems 
  and quality of care measures. For example, the monitors will review and analyze 
  Vencor's policies, procedures and operations, along with the individual facilities 
  internal reports, staffing data and assessments of patient and resident care. 
  The monitors will work collaboratively with Vencor and the OIG to identify and 
  correct system deficiencies and to enhance existing quality improvement programs. 
<p>Additional measures in the CIA require Vencor to: 
<ul>
  <li>conduct training each year for all employees to assure compliance with federal 
    health care requirements,</li>
  <li>continue to operate an internal compliance hotline,</li>
  <li>create a comprehensive internal quality improvement program which will include 
    the review of quality-related data, direct quality improvement activities 
    and implement and monitor corrective action plans,</li>
  <li>enhance the current system of internal financial controls to promote compliance 
    with federal health care program requirements on billing and related financial 
    issues,</li>
  <li>retain an independent review organization to evaluate the integrity and 
    effectiveness of the Company's internal systems and report annually its findings 
    to the OIG.</li>
</ul>
<p>"We commend the new management team at Vencor for working with us to develop 
  an internal quality improvement model that we hope will become the standard 
  for the long-term care industry," said Inspector General June Gibbs Brown. "We 
  have had serious concerns about the company's past performance and believe that 
  significant changes needed to be made. Vencor's engagement of the quality monitor 
  and implementation of the CIA demonstrate the company's commitment of resources 
  to providing quality care to nursing home residents. This is an excellent example 
  of how government and the private sector can effectively collaborate toward 
  a common goal--improving the care provided to our senior citizens." <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  "Through this independent monitoring, Vencor is taking steps that would help 
  us and the states to ensure that nursing-home residents and hospital patients 
  receive quality care," HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said. "This agreement 
  should serve as a model for preserving quality of care and the safety of beneficiaries 
  for corporations in similar circumstances." <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Vencor has filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy 
  Code. The terms of this agreement will not be effective until there is a settlement 
  of the government's ongoing investigations of the company and the agreement 
  is approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
