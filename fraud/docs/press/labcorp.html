<h3 align="center">LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS (LabCorp) TO PAY 
  $187 MILLION TO RESOLVE CHARGES OF FALSE CLAIMS TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS</h3>
<p>Today, Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, Office of Inspector General for 
  the Department of Health and Human Services; the Department of Justice; the 
  United States Attorney's offices, for the Southern District of California, Middle 
  District of North Carolina and Southern District of New York; the Defense Criminal 
  Investigative Service and the FBI announced that Laboratory Corporation of America 
  (LabCorp) has agreed to pay $182 million to resolve civil liabilities associated 
  with submitting false claims for medically unnecessary laboratory tests to defraud 
  federal and state health care programs. </p>
<p>Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said &quot;This agreement represents the 
  third largest financial settlement involving health care fraud in the history 
  of the False Claims Act. It is also the biggest settlement involving a laboratory 
  in recent years. Fighting health care fraud continues to be the major priority 
  of our office. Businesses should be held strictly accountable for any misconduct 
  while providing services to Medicare and Medicaid patients.&quot;</p>
<p>Early this afternoon, Allied Clinical Laboratories, San Diego Regional Laboratory, 
  a LabCorp subsidiary, pled guilty to a one count criminal information charging 
  the laboratory with defrauding the United States and its agency, the Health 
  Care Financing Administration, by submitting a false claim to the Medicare program. 
  The Allied San Diego Regional laboratory agreed to pay a $5 million criminal 
  fine as a result of the guilty plea, and Allied Clinical Laboratories will be 
  excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs by the Office 
  of Inspector General. The plea, which was taken in the Middle District of North 
  Carolina, was agreed to by both the Southern District of California U.S. Attorney 
  and the Middle District of North Carolina U.S. Attorney. </p>
<p>Also today, LabCorp and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department 
  of Health and Human Services entered into a detailed corporate integrity agreement, 
  by which LabCorp agreed to enhance its existing compliance programs. Inspector 
  General Brown complimented Roche Biomedical Labs, a predecessor of LabCorp, 
  for its compliance efforts, saying that &quot;Roche Biomedical Labs has been 
  a leader in efforts to reform the laboratory industry. I commend LabCorp for 
  its compliance efforts and for being one of the first laboratories to execute 
  a comprehensive corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General. 
  They have worked with the Government to develop a compliance program which will 
  be a model for the laboratory industry.&quot; She commented that &quot;Today's 
  settlement and corporate integrity agreement reflect our continued commitment 
  to work with the health care industry to ensure compliance with our health care 
  programs and to keep them viable for our beneficiaries.&quot;</p>
<p>The government's civil and criminal recoveries from LabCorp and its subsidiaries 
  will total $187 million. The $187 million in restitution, fines and interest 
  will be apportioned among the Medicare Trust Fund, various State Medicaid agencies, 
  CHAMPUS, the FEHBP, the Railroad Retirement Board, and False Claims Act qui 
  tam relators. </p>
<p>Today's announcement is the result of an exhaustive 3-year investigation of 
  subsidiaries and corporate predecessors of LabCorp by both Federal and State 
  law enforcement agencies. The LabCorp settlement encompasses issues arising 
  from investigations of Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. (Allied), National 
  Health Laboratories (NHL), and Roche Biomedical Laboratories (Roche). After 
  a series of corporate mergers, Allied, NHL and Roche became LabCorp. </p>
<p>The investigation of LabCorp's corporate predecessors was launched in 1993 
  as part of a nationwide investigation of independent diagnostic clinical laboratories 
  by state and federal law enforcement authorities. During the course of extensive 
  work by the OIG's Office of Audit Services and Office of Investigations, as 
  well as the HCFA Benefits Integirty Staff, Medicare carriers across the country 
  and Medicaid fraud control units, DCIS and the FBI, the investigators found 
  numerous problems in the ways that independent clinical laboratories were charging 
  Medicare for clinical tests.</p>
<p>For example, laboratories engaged in abusive marketing practices which misled 
  doctors to order extra tests in addition to the tests actually needed to care 
  for the patient. These &quot;add-on&quot; tests were often characterized as 
  costing nothing or only a nominal additional amount. Unknown to the doctor, 
  the labs billed Medicare, Medicaid and other health care programs the full price 
  for these unnecessary tests. </p>
<p>When the OIG began its investigation in 1993, it subpoenaed seven national 
  laboratories. After a series of corporate mergers, three of those laboratories 
  (Allied Clinical Labs, National Health Labs and Roche Biomedical Labs) became 
  LabCorp. To date, recoveries from the major clinical diagnostic laboratories 
  as a result of these investigations is approximately $363,375,000.00. Additional 
  recoveries may be announced in the near future. </p>
