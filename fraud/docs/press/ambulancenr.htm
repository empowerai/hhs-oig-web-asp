<p align="center">Inspector General Proposes Anti-Kickback Safe Harbor for Ambulance 
  Restocking</p>
</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector 
  General today proposed an anti-kickback statute &quot;safe harbor&quot; that 
  would protect certain arrangements involving hospitals that restock drugs and 
  medical supplies without charge for ambulance suppliers transporting emergency 
  patients to the hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-kickback statute prohibits the knowing payment 
  or receipt of anything of value to influence referrals of federal health care 
  program business, including Medicare and Medicaid. Safe harbors immunize from 
  prosecution certain payment and business practices that are potentially prohibited 
  by the anti-kickback law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The proposed safe harbor is designed broadly to allow 
  properly structured ambulance restocking arrangements to continue without fear 
  of liability under the anti-kickback statute,&quot; said D. McCarty Thornton, 
  chief counsel to the Inspector General. &quot;Appropriate restocking arrangements 
  can serve a significant public interest by making sure ambulances are fully 
  stocked with current medications and supplies compatible with equipment used 
  in local emergency rooms.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be protected by a safe harbor, an arrangement must fit 
  squarely in the safe harbor. Compliance with safe harbors is voluntary, and 
  failure to comply with a safe harbor provision does not mean that an arrangement 
  is illegal. Arrangements that do not comply with a safe harbor, however, must 
  be analyzed on a case-by-case basis for compliance with the anti-kickback statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed ambulance restocking safe harbor went on public 
  display today at the <i>Federal Register</i> and is scheduled for publication 
  as a proposed rule in the May 22, 2000, <i>Federal Register</i>. There will 
  be a 60-day public comment period from the date of <i>Federal Register</i> publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed rule, safe harbor protection would be 
  provided for ambulance restocking arrangements that satisfy all of the conditions 
  in one of two categories established by the safe harbor. Both categories pertain 
  only to emergency ambulance services, and the safe harbor would not protect 
  restocking of ambulance supplies, linens or medications following routine ambulance 
  transports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first category would protect restocking arrangements 
  where an ambulance supplier pays the hospital fair-market value for drugs and 
  supplies used during the transport of an emergency patient. Payment would not 
  have to be made at the time of restocking as long as commercially reasonable 
  and appropriate payment arrangements have been made in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second category would protect arrangements when a hospital 
  contemporaneously restocks drugs and supplies used during the transport of an 
  emergency patient, even if the restocking is for free or reduced prices. The 
  Office of Inspector General is proposing that the following seven conditions 
  be met to qualify for this safe harbor protection:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>Hospitals must restock on an equal basis for all ambulance suppliers, 
        whether for-profit or not-for-profit, that bring emergency patients to 
        the hospital.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>Restocking arrangements must be part of a comprehensive and coordinated 
        effort to improve the emergency medical services delivery system in the 
        relevant service area, must be open to all emergency ambulance suppliers 
        and hospitals operating in the service area, and must be monitored by 
        a non-profit entity such as a regional emergency medical services council 
        or functionally similar organization that will be known as the oversight 
        entity.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The safe harbor incorporates significant flexibility regarding the size, 
        composition and structure of the oversight entity so as not to impose 
        an undue burden on local emergency medical systems. The Office of Inspector 
        General recognizes that oversight entities will vary depending on the 
        size and resources of a particular service area.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>Restocking arrangements must be in writing.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>To prevent duplicate payments under Medicare Part A and Part B, the 
        hospital must not bill any federal health care program or beneficiary 
        for the restocked drugs or supplies or write off the cost of such drugs 
        and supplies as bad debt.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>To prevent double billing and program overpayments, ambulance suppliers 
        may not bill any federal health care program or beneficiary <u>separately</u> 
        for restocked drugs and supplies. Existing payment policies for ambulance 
        suppliers typically include the cost of drugs and supplies used in transporting 
        a patient. Additionally, since ambulance suppliers could receive drugs 
        and supplies for free or reduced cost under the safe harbor, it would 
        not be appropriate for the supplier to bill the government or beneficiaries 
        separately for the drugs and supplies.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>The hospital and ambulance supplier must maintain records of the restocked 
        drugs and supplies and make the records available to the Health and Human 
        Services’ Secretary on request.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <ul>
      <li>The hospital and ambulance supplier must otherwise comply with all federal, 
        state and local laws regulating emergency medical care and the provision 
        of drugs and medical supplies, including laws relating to the handling 
        of controlled substances such as morphine.</li>
    </ul>
