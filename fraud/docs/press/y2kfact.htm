<p align="center"><strong>Office of Inspector General Surveys of Medicare Managed 
  Care Organizations'</strong> <br>
  <strong>and Fee-For-Service Providers' Y2K Readiness</strong></p>
<p><em>Overview: Ensuring that computer systems are prepared for the Year 2000 
  is a critical challenge for the entire health care industry. The Office of Inspector 
  General has conducted two sets of surveys to provide information about the Y2K 
  readiness of Medicare managed care organizations and fee-for-service providers. 
  The first survey of Medicare fee-for-service providers was released in March 
  1999, and the first survey of Medicare managed care organizations was released 
  in May 1999. The two surveys released today provide self-reported information 
  about the Y2K readiness of providers and managed care organizations as of July 
  1999.</em> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <em>The latest surveys indicate both groups have made significant progress in 
  preparing for the Year 2000. However, some providers and managed care organizations 
  have not taken needed steps to prepare their computer systems -- especially 
  relating to testing, contingency planning, medical equipment and ensuring compliance 
  with external business partners. The Office of Inspector General strongly urges 
  all Medicare providers and managed care organizations to follow the guidance 
  of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) about how best to prepare 
  for the Year 2000.</em> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Survey of Medicare Managed Care Organizations</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Working with HCFA, the Office of Inspector General identified 149 managed care 
  organizations for inclusion in the survey. Separately, HCFA identified 204 managed 
  care organizations and conducted 59 site visits to determine the Y2K readiness 
  of these organizations. These 204 managed care organizations were not included 
  in the Office of Inspector General survey. Of the 149 managed care organizations 
  sent surveys, 144 responded to the survey for a response rate of 97 percent. 
  Another 17 managed care organizations completed surveys, so the total number 
  of managed care organizations responding was 161. 
<ul>
  <p>Key findings of the managed care survey include: </p>
  <li><strong>More than four-fifths of managed care organizations reported that 
    their systems were Y2K compliant</strong>. Overall, 85 percent of Managed 
    care organization respondents said they were Y2K ready. Approximately 9 percent 
    of these managed care organizations had not completed testing their systems. 
    A managed care organization was considered to have overall Y2K compliance 
    if it reported that all applicable systems were Y2K ready. Ninety-four percent 
    of managed care organizations reported that vendor-supported products, such 
    as hardware, telecommunications and embedded processors, were compliant. Almost 
    all managed care organizations had established recommended infrastructures 
    in preparation for Y2K testing, but most had not contracted out for independent 
    assessment of Y2K readiness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>About one-half of managed care organizations indicated they were 
    taking steps toward ensuring compliance with external partners.</strong> Fifty-six 
    percent of managed care organizations reported receiving commitments from 
    relevant data exchange partners to participate in end-to-end testing; 9 percent 
    believed such commitments were not applicable; 50 percent had tested exchanging 
    data with their subcontractors' systems; and 35 percent had tested exchanging 
    data with their medical providers' systems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>About 80 percent of managed care organizations reported developing 
    contingency plans, and about 30 percent reported testing their contingency 
    plans.</strong> Compared to the previous study, 5 percent to10 percent more 
    managed care organizations reported developing contingency plans related to 
    specific computer systems. As of July, 83 percent reported developing a contingency 
    strategy for their membership enrollment systems, 79 percent reported developing 
    a contingency strategy for their premium billing systems, and 73 percent reported 
    developing a contingency plan for their medical information systems. As of 
    July 1999, 28 percent of managed care organizations reported they had tested 
    contingency plans, compared to only 8 percent in February 1999. <br>
    <br>
    HCFA required managed care organizations to submit contingency plans for review 
    of content and feasibility of implementation. According to the HCFA review, 
    33 percent of the contingency plans submitted as of August 1999 required little 
    or no modification, while 67 percent needed major or complete revision.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Survey of Medicare Fee-For-Service Providers</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Using Medicare data bases, a random sample of 1,000 providers from each of the 
  following groups was selected: acute care hospitals, nursing facilities, home-health 
  agencies, durable-medical equipment (DME) suppliers and physicians. Completed 
  surveys were received from 56 percent of hospitals, 45 percent of nursing facilities, 
  43 percent of home-health agencies, 29 percent of DME suppliers and 20 percent 
  of physicians. 
<ul>
  <p>Key findings of the fee-for-service survey include: </p>
  <li> <strong>About two-thirds of Medicare fee-for-service providers reported 
    that their billing and medical records systems were Y2K ready. </strong>Between 
    61 percent and 75 percent of providers that use computerized billing and medical 
    records systems reported that these systems were Y2K ready. Almost all providers 
    expected their billing and medical records systems to be fully ready by the 
    end of 1999.&nbsp; However, at least one-third of providers reported that 
    they had not yet tested the readiness of these systems. &nbsp; Furthermore, 
    many providers had not tested data exchanges with vendors and contractors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Even fewer fee-for-service providers reported that their biomedical 
    equipment was Y2K ready. </strong>Less than half of providers reported that 
    all of their biomedical equipment was Y2K ready. However, most providers expected 
    their biomedical equipment to be completely ready by the end of the year. 
    Hospitals were the most likely of the provider groups to report that they 
    had tested their equipment. The majority of providers indicated that they 
    were relying on the manufacturers of their biomedical equipment to provide 
    Y2K information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Many Medicare fee-for-service providers had not completed contingency 
    plans. &nbsp; </strong>Less than 60 percent of survey respondents said they 
    had completed contingency plans.&nbsp; Some providers reported that they did 
    not intend to make contingency plans before the end of the year.&nbsp; In 
    addition, uncertainty about external suppliers and utility providers was also 
    a cause of concern among some Medicare providers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Not all providers were taking advantage of Federal outreach efforts. 
    </strong>&nbsp; Some providers were not aware that Y2K information is available 
    on numerous Federal web sites.&nbsp; However, almost all of the respondents 
    who had visited the web sites found them to be helpful.&nbsp; While approximately 
    70 percent of providers reported that their Medicare contractors had sent 
    them information or offered assistance with Y2K, about 30 percent were unaware 
    of contractor efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Many Medicare fee-for-service providers were not Y2K ready as of 
    July 1999, and some providers may not be ready by Jan. 1.</strong>&nbsp; In 
    the six months between the two surveys, health care providers generally reported 
    improvements in the status of their billing systems, medical records systems, 
    and biomedical equipment. &nbsp; Providers were also more likely to report 
    having completed contingency plans than they were six months ago.&nbsp; However, 
    certain provider groups were further along the path to Y2K readiness than 
    others.&nbsp; These differences were reflected by their reported readiness 
    as of July 1999; the concrete steps they had taken in preparation for Y2K; 
    and their higher response rates.<br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong>Furthermore, some providers still reported not taking the necessary 
    steps to ensure that they are Y2K ready. Additionally, since a large number 
    of providers did not respond to the survey, we have no information to measure 
    their current Y2K status, or their prospects for future readiness. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <strong><strong>While Y2K readiness is the responsibility of individual 
    providers, HCFA has undertaken numerous efforts to assist them.</strong> </strong>As 
    HCFA, as well as the provider associations, continue their outreach and education 
    initiatives, the Office of Inspector General suggests they focus on the following: 
    emphasizing the need to test data exchanges as well as internal computer systems, 
    stressing the importance of contingency planning, and publicizing Web sites 
    where Y2K information is available.&nbsp; With only a few months left until 
    the year 2000 arrives, it is increasingly important that HCFA, provider associations, 
    and the providers themselves work together to ensure that beneficiaries will 
    continue to receive uninterrupted quality care.<br>
    <br>
    The following organizations assisted the Office of Inspector General with 
    the fee-for-service survey: American Association of Homes and Services for 
    the Aging, American Health Care Association, American Hospital Association, 
    American Medical Association, Health Industry Distributors Association, National 
    Association for Home Care and National Association for Medical Equipment Services.</li>
