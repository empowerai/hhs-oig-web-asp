<p align="center">Inspector General Issues Draft Compliance Program Guidance for 
  Physician Practices</p>
</b> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector 
  General today issued draft guidance to help physicians in solo or small group 
  practices conduct effective voluntary compliance measures to prevent fraud and 
  abuse in government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Adopting a voluntary compliance program is a lot like 
  practicing preventive medicine; it helps identify and treat small problems before 
  they become big problems,&quot; Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Strong enforcement and strong voluntary prevention 
  are equally important in safeguarding the government health programs from fraud 
  and abuse,&quot; Inspector General Brown said. &quot;And the cornerstone of 
  our prevention efforts is the development of voluntary compliance guidance that, 
  in partnership with the private sector, will help the health care community 
  develop effective compliance programs.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft guidance — <i>Compliance Program Guidance for 
  Individual and Small Group Physician Practices</i> — is scheduled for publication 
  later this month as a <i>Federal Register</i> notice and will have a 45-day 
  comment period following publication. Previous draft guidances have been issued 
  with 30-day comment periods, but the Office of Inspector General wanted to provide 
  extra time for the physician community to review the draft guidance. After reviewing 
  and incorporating the comments, as appropriate, the Office of Inspector General 
  plans to publish a final version of the guidance later this year in the <i>Federal 
  Register</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We know physicians are busy, but we hope they will 
  take time to review the draft guidance and provide us with thoughtful comments,&quot; 
  Inspector General Brown said. &quot;Practicing physicians can offer invaluable 
  insights about how they and their colleagues can put voluntary compliance plans 
  into place in their practices.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Office of Inspector General believes the great majority 
  of physicians are honest and committed to providing high quality medical care 
  to Medicare beneficiaries. Under the law, physicians are not subject to civil 
  or criminal penalties for innocent errors, or even negligence. The government’s 
  primary enforcement tool, the civil False Claims Act, covers only offenses that 
  are committed with <i>actual knowledge</i> of the falsity of the claim, <i>reckless 
  disregard</i> or <i>deliberate ignorance</i> of the truth or falsity of a claim. 
  The False Claims Act simply does not cover mistakes, errors or negligence. The 
  Office of Inspector General is very mindful of the difference between innocent 
  errors (&quot;erroneous claims&quot;) and reckless or intentional conduct (&quot;fraudulent 
  claims&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An effective compliance program can help physicians identify 
  both erroneous and fraudulent claims and help ensure that submitted claims are 
  true and accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to other guidance already issued by the Office of 
  Inspector General for clinical laboratories, hospitals, home health agencies, 
  third-party medical billing companies, durable medical equipment suppliers, 
  hospices, Medicare+Choice plans and nursing facilities, the draft physician 
  guidance is based on the following seven elements: 1) implementation of written 
  policies and standards of conduct; 2) designation of a compliance officer or 
  contact; 3) development of training and education programs; 4) creation of accessible 
  lines of communication to keep practice employees updated about compliance activities; 
  5) performance of internal audits to monitor compliance; 6) enforcement of standards 
  through well-publicized disciplinary directives; and 7) prompt corrective action 
  to detected offenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft guidance identifies specific compliance risk areas 
  for physicians, such as coding and billing; the provision of reasonable and 
  necessary services; documentation; and improper inducements, kickbacks and self-referrals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing that solo and small group physician practices 
  may not have the resources to put a full-fledged compliance program in place, 
  the Office of Inspector General throughout the guidance suggests how a practice 
  can foster a culture that embraces compliance consistent with the size and resources 
  available to the physician practice. For example, instead of operating a confidential 
  hot line to receive complaints, the physician practice might implement a clear 
  &quot;open door&quot; policy for employees to surface concerns about compliance 
  issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dedicating an office bulletin board to compliance information 
  might also be a way to make sure everyone in the practice has access to up-to-date 
  compliance information. In situations where a practice cannot afford to designate 
  an employee to oversee compliance activities, the draft guidance suggests that 
  those responsibilities be divided among practice staff who would then serve 
  as &quot;compliance contacts.&quot; Another possibility is outsourcing all or 
  part of the compliance functions to a consultant, billing company or other entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft guidance also provides direction to larger practices 
  in developing compliance programs by recommending that larger practices use 
  both the physician guidance and previously issued guidance, such as the <i>Third-Party 
  Medical Billing Company Compliance Program Guidance</i> or the <i>Clinical Laboratory 
  Compliance Program Guidance</i>, to create a compliance program that meets the 
  need of the larger practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft guidance includes several appendices outlining 
  additional risk areas physicians should be familiar with, as well as basic information 
  about criminal, civil and administrative statutes related to the federal health 
  care programs. There is also information about the Office of Inspector General’s 
  provider self-disclosure protocol, how to request an advisory opinion and Internet 
  resources that may be useful to physician practices.</p>
