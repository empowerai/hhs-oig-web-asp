  HEADLINE: TWO SENTENCED IN MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR FRAUD SCHEME </b></p>
<p>Inspector General June Gibbs Brown announced that two Tennessee men were sentenced 
  in Massachusetts in connection with a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud 
  Medicare. Gary Lakins, owner and president of Providers Inc., a Tennessee-based 
  company, was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $10,000 
  in restitution. Randy Jenkins, a company official, received 2 years probation 
  and was told to pay restitution of $1,000. Three other company managers pled 
  guilty and were sentenced earlier in the fraudulent scheme that caused an estimated 
  loss of $5 million to the Medicare program.</p>
<p>Providers, a durable medical equipment company, billed carriers in several 
  States, including Massachusetts, for incontinence care items supposedly supplied 
  to patients in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The defendants billed 
  at inflated rates, billed for supplies not sold, backdated requests for payment 
  from Medicare, and withheld from Medicare refunds owed for supplies ordered 
  for deceased patients. Providers engaged in &quot;carrier shopping,&quot; setting 
  up shell offices and mail drops across the country, billing where the highest 
  rate for an item could be obtained. While the other defendants received little 
  profit from the fraud beyond their salaries, Lakins received more than $1 million 
  from Providers during the course of the conspiracy. </p>
<p>The investigation of this case was a joint effort of the Office of Inspector 
  General with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Criminal Investigation 
  Services and the Railroad Retirement Board.</p>
