<p align="center"><b>No Serious Access Problems Found for Medicare Nursing Home 
  Patients,</b> <br>
  <b>But Careful Monitoring Needed</b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new nursing home payment system has not diminished Medicare 
  beneficiaries' access to needed skilled-nursing care, but the effects of the 
  new system require careful monitoring, according to a report issued today by 
  the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So far, no serious problems in placing Medicare patients 
  in nursing homes are apparent,&quot; Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. 
  &quot;However, nursing homes are changing their admission practices in response 
  to the prospective-payment system. This early assessment shows we need to continue 
  monitoring to make sure beneficiaries receive the care they need and that nursing 
  homes are paid accurately for Medicare services.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required payment for Medicare 
  skilled-nursing facilities to change from a cost-based system to a prospective-payment 
  system, which provides a fixed daily payment that varies based on a beneficiary's 
  condition and expected medical needs. The new payment system began July 1, 1998, 
  with most skilled-nursing facilities moving to the prospective-payment system 
  on Jan. 1, 1999. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To assess the new payment system's impact on beneficiary 
  access to skilled-nursing facility care, the Office of Inspector General surveyed 
  180 randomly selected hospital discharge planners and analyzed Medicare data. 
  The findings are contained in a report titled <i>Early Effects of the Prospective 
  Payment System on Access to Skilled Nursing Facilities</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most discharge planners -- 66 percent -- reported that it 
  is &quot;not at all difficult&quot; to place Medicare patients in nursing homes, 
  with some pointing out that Medicare pays higher rates than Medicaid. Another 
  32 percent said it is &quot;somewhat difficult&quot; to place Medicare patients, 
  while only 1 percent reported that it is &quot;very difficult&quot; to place 
  Medicare patients in nursing homes. About a fifth of discharge planners said 
  it has become more difficult to place Medicare patients in the past year because 
  of the new payment system but indicated they were able to place these patients. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An analysis of Medicare data generally confirmed the discharge 
  planners' views. The proportion of all Medicare hospital patients discharged 
  to skilled-nursing facilities did not differ between the first five months in 
  1998, which is before the prospective-payment system was put in place, and the 
  same five months in 1999, which is after the move to the new payment system. 
  The review also did not show any large changes in the types of Medicare patients 
  who were discharged to skilled-nursing facilities, with the 10 most common diagnoses 
  remaining the same in both years. The total number of Medicare-certified nursing 
  home beds increased 7.4 percent between 1996 and 1998 from 672,329 beds to 722,278 
  beds, which is a key factor in nursing home access. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While about half of the discharge planners believed inpatient 
  lengths of stay have increased for Medicare patients in the past year, Medicare 
  data show no substantial increases in lengths of stay for Medicare patients 
  with the 10 most common diagnoses who are discharged to skilled-nursing facilities. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About half of all discharge planners surveyed reported that 
  nursing homes have changed their admissions practices because of the new payment 
  system. They say nursing homes are requesting more detailed clinical information 
  about patients, looking more closely at the cost of care, and conducting more 
  in-person assessments of patients before making admission decisions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked which types of patients have become more difficult 
  to place, 58 percent of the discharge planners reported that Medicare patients 
  requiring extensive services such as intravenous feedings, intravenous medications, 
  or ventilator/respirator care have become more difficult to place in nursing 
  homes in the past year. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But 69 percent of the discharge planners reported that Medicare 
  patients who need special rehabilitation, which is reimbursed at the highest 
  rate under the prospective-payment system, have become easier to place in nursing 
  homes in the past year. Discharge planners said patients with diagnoses such 
  as joint replacements and strokes and patients requiring rehabilitation therapy 
  such as physical, occupational or speech therapy have generally become easier 
  to place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other reports released today provide more information 
  about physical and occupational therapy provided to Medicare patients in nursing 
  homes. The reports are based on medical record reviews of a national random 
  sample of 218 Medicare patients and the physical and occupational therapy they 
  received in March 1998, just four months before the new payment system went 
  into effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One report, <i>Physical and Occupational Therapy in Nursing 
  Homes: Quality of Care and Medical Necessity for Medicare Patients</i>, found 
  that most Medicare patients received appropriate therapy for their initial medical 
  conditions and benefitted from therapy. However, the review also found that 
  almost 13 percent of therapy was billed improperly to Medicare because the therapy 
  was not medically necessary or was provided by inappropriate staff. Another 
  4 percent of therapy was not properly documented in the patients' medical records. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other report, <i>Physical and Occupational Therapy in 
  Nursing Homes: Cost of Improper Billings to Medicare</i>, estimated that for 
  the 12-month period ending June 30, 1998, Medicare paid skilled-nursing facilities 
  almost $1 billion for improperly billed physical and occupational therapy and 
  $331 million for improperly documented physical and occupational therapy. Additionally, 
  the findings show that skilled-nursing facilities charged Medicare significantly 
  more for contract occupational therapists than the nursing facilities paid for 
  these services. These mark ups added an estimated $342 million a year to Medicare's 
  costs for occupational therapy. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unnecessary and improperly documented therapy, 
  as well as the occupational therapy mark-ups, were not identified and eliminated 
  before the move to the new prospective-payment system, resulting in inflated 
  base-year costs for the new payment system. Therefore, should any consideration 
  be given to modifying the prospective-payment system, the identified inappropriate 
  therapy costs should be considered, according to the report. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings also have quality of care implications 
  because some beneficiaries received too much or inappropriate therapy. The reports 
  recommend that the Health Care Financing Administration adequately fund Medicare 
  contractors to perform medical reviews of therapy and work with national therapy 
  and nursing home associations to ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality, 
  needed care. </p>
