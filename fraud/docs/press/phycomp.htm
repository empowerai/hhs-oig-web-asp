  Program Guidance for Physician Practices</font></strong> 
<p> The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General ("OIG") 
  today issued final guidance to help physicians in individual and small group 
  practices design voluntary compliance programs. <br>
  <br>
  "The intent of the guidance is to provide a roadmap to develop a voluntary compliance 
  program that best fits the needs of that individual practice. The guidance itself 
  provides great flexibility as to how a physician practice could implement compliance 
  efforts in a manner that fits with the practice's existing operations and resources," 
  Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. <br>
  <br>
  The final guidance -- <em>Compliance Program Guidance for Individual and Small 
  Group Physician Practices</em> -- is scheduled for publication this week as 
  a <em>Federal Register</em> notice and is being posted today on the OIG website. 
<p> Inspector General Brown further commented, "We are encouraging physician practices 
  to adopt the active application of compliance principles in their practice, 
  rather than implement rigid, costly, formal procedures. Our goal in issuing 
  this final guidance was to show physician practices that compliance can become 
  a part of the practice culture without the practice having to expend substantial 
  monetary or time resources." <br>
  <br>
  The OIG believes the great majority of physicians are honest and committed to 
  providing high quality medical care to Medicare beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, physicians are not subject to civil, administrative or criminal 
  penalties for innocent errors, or even negligence. The Government's primary 
  enforcement tool, the civil False Claims Act, covers only offenses that are 
  committed with <em>actual knowledge</em> of the falsity of the claim, <em>reckless 
  disregard</em> or <em>deliberate ignorance</em> of the truth or falsity of a 
  claim. The False Claims Act does not cover mistakes, errors or negligence. The 
  OIG is very mindful of the difference between innocent errors ("erroneous claims") 
  and reckless or intentional conduct ("fraudulent claims"). <br>
  <br>
  A voluntary compliance program can help physicians identify both erroneous and 
  fraudulent claims and help ensure that submitted claims are true and accurate. 
  It can also help the practice by speeding up and optimizing proper payment of 
  claims, minimizing billing mistakes and avoiding conflicts with the self-referral 
  and anti-kickback statutes. <br>
  <br>
  Unlike other guidance previously issued by the OIG, the final physician guidance 
  does not suggest that physician practices implement all seven standard components 
  of a full scale compliance program. While the seven components provide a solid 
  basis upon which a physician practice can create a compliance program, the OIG 
  acknowledges that full implementation of all components may not be feasible 
  for smaller physician practices. Instead, the guidance emphasizes a step by 
  step approach for those practices to follow in developing and implementing a 
  voluntary compliance program. As a first step, physician practices can begin 
  by identifying risk areas which, based on a practice's specific history with 
  billing problems and other compliance issues, might benefit from closer scrutiny 
  and corrective/educational measures. <br>
  <br>
  The step by step approach is as follows: 1) conducting internal monitoring and 
  auditing through the performance of periodic audits; 2) implementing compliance 
  and practice standards through the development of written standards and procedures; 
  3) designating a compliance officer or contact(s) to monitor compliance efforts 
  and enforce practice standards; 4) conducting appropriate training and education 
  on practice standards and procedures; 5) responding appropriately to detected 
  violations through the investigation of allegations and the disclosure of incidents 
  to appropriate Government entities; 6) developing open lines of communication, 
  such as discussions at staff meetings regarding erroneous or fraudulent conduct 
  issues and community bulletin boards, to keep practice employees updated regarding 
  compliance activities; and 7) enforcing disciplinary standards through well-publicized 
  guidelines. <br>
  <br>
  The final guidance identifies four specific compliance risk areas for physicians: 
  1) proper coding and billing; 2) ensuring that services are reasonable and necessary; 
  3) proper documentation; and 4) avoiding improper inducements, kickbacks and 
  self-referrals. These risk areas reflect areas in which the OIG has focused 
  its investigations and audits related to physician practices. <br>
  <br>
  Recognizing the financial and staffing resource constraints faced by physician 
  practices, the final guidance stresses flexibility in the manner a practice 
  implements voluntary compliance measures. The OIG encourages physician practices 
  to participate in the compliance programs of other providers, such as hospitals 
  or other settings in which the physicians practice. A physician practice's participation 
  in such compliance programs could be a way, at least partly, to augment the 
  practice's own compliance efforts. <br>
  <br>
  The final guidance also provides direction to larger practices in developing 
  compliance programs by recommending that they use both the physician guidance 
  and previously issued guidance, such as the <em>Third-Party Medical Billing 
  Company Compliance Program Guidance</em> or the <em>Clinical Laboratory Compliance 
  Program Guidance</em>, to create a compliance program that meets the needs of 
  the larger practice. <br>
  <br>
  The final guidance includes several appendices outlining additional risk areas 
  about which various physicians expressed interest, as well as information about 
  criminal, civil and administrative statutes related to the Federal health care 
  programs. There is also information about the OIG's provider self-disclosure 
  protocol and Internet resources that may be useful to physician practices.
