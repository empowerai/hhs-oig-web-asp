  HEADLINE: Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corporation Pays a Total of $5.8 Million to 
  Resolve Charges of False Medicare Claims </p>
<hr>
<p>Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the 
  Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
  announced that Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corporation has paid a total of $5.8 million 
  to resolve civil liability for false claims. Horizon, a national provider of 
  nursing care and rehabilitation services in Albuquerque, New Mexico and employer 
  of 40,000 people, paid $4.6 million to DOJ to settle the allegations. Earlier, 
  Horizon returned nearly $1.2 million when it learned about the OIG investigation. 
</p>
<p>In 1994 Horizon bought a chain of 19 rehabilitation facilities, which it found 
  had not billed for ancillary medical supplies. Believing it had found an unclaimed 
  income source, Horizon billed Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers for supplies 
  which might have been used in various services. However, Horizon's billing and 
  accounting staff lacked adequate training. Horizon misused and misinterpreted 
  the records, which caused it to bill for multiple medical supplies. For example, 
  since tracheostomy care is usually given 3 times a day, Horizon billed for 93 
  trach tubes, 93 trach care kits and other related items, per beneficiary, for 
  each 30-day period. Intermediary personnel indicated that one trach tube a year 
  was normal. As a result, from July to December 1994, the company billed Medicare 
  $3.4 million for medical supplies and was paid $1.2 million. </p>
<p>Treble damages were assessed because of Horizon's disregard of proper billing 
  requirements and of inquiries by employees. However, Horizon cooperated fully 
  in the investigation and agreed to enter a corporate integrity program. The 
  program requires that Horizon appoint a subcommittee, conduct ongoing orientation 
  and training sessions, and perform regular audits and assessments to ensure 
  billing accuracy. </p>
<p>The investigation of this case was a joint effort of OIG and the Federal Bureau 
  of Investigation.</p>
