  Commentary Distorts HHS IG's Gainsharing Bulletin </strong> 
<p>[<em>By: D. McCarty Thornton, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General of the 
  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Kevin G. McAnaney</em>, <em>Chief, 
  Industry Guidance Branch, Office of Counsel to the Inspector General</em>] 
<p>The Analysis and Perspectives section of the August 11, 1999, Health Care Fraud 
  Report, featured a commentary addressing the Office of Inspector General's ("OIG's") 
  recent "Special Advisory Bulletin on Gainsharing Arrangements and CMPs for Hospital 
  Payments to Physicians to Reduce or Limit Services to Beneficiaries." (64 Fed. 
  Reg. 37985 (July 14, 1999)). The commentary made a number of charges regarding 
  the substance of, and the procedure used to issue, the Special Advisory Bulletin. 
  In addition, the commentary contained a number of factual inaccuracies, some 
  of which are now unfortunately being repeated in other trade publications. 
<p>Given the mischaracterizations and factual inaccuracies contained in the commentary, 
  we are concerned that allowing the commentary to go unchallenged may create 
  a false impression in the health industry. In an effort to forestall further 
  misunderstandings and detrimental reliance on the commentary by those in the 
  industry who want to avoid improper business relationships, we wish to make 
  our position clear on the following points: 
<ul>
  <li>The interpretation of section 1128A(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act") 
    proffered by the commentary is supported neither by the plain meaning nor 
    the purposes of the statute.</li>
  <li>The OIG's 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on section 1128A(b) articulated 
    a categorical prohibition on hospital payments to physicians that are based 
    on reductions in costs for treatment of fee-for-service Medicare or Medicaid 
    patients under the physicians' direct care -- a position wholly consistent 
    with the Special Advisory Bulletin.</li>
  <li>The OIG issued the Special Advisory Bulletin in a manner that was fully 
    consistent with congressional directives for greater industry guidance and 
    did not subvert or otherwise improperly shortchange the advisory opinion process.</li>
  <li>The OIG's position on gainsharing arrangements is clearly stated in the 
    Special Advisory Bulletin, and parties ignore the Special Advisory Bulletin 
    at their own risk. Prompt unwinding of improper gainsharing arrangements will 
    be taken into account in enforcement decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although in the interest of brevity we are limiting our response to three major 
  points, we want to make clear that we believe the commentary contains other 
  inaccuracies and mischaracterizations. 
<p><strong>Interpretation of Section 1128A(b). </strong>A principal focus of both 
  the Special Advisory Bulletin and the commentary is the proper interpretation 
  of section 1128A(b)(1), the civil monetary penalty provision addressing hospital 
  payments to physicians to induce the reduction or limitation of services to 
  patients under the physicians' direct care.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  The authors of the commentary contend that the "plain language" of the statute 
  requires <em>both</em>that a violator have the specific intent to induce treating 
  physicians to withhold <em>medically necessary</em> services from their patients 
  and that the incentive plan <em>actually cause</em> a reduction or limitation 
  of medically necessary services. In our view, this interpretation is plainly 
  wrong. Simply put, the language of the statute refers to "services," not "medically 
  necessary services," and requires a showing of an intent to induce a reduction 
  of services, not an actual reduction. 
<p>The OIG interprets section 1128A(b) as prohibiting any physician incentive 
  plan that conditions hospital payments to physicians or physician groups on 
  savings attributable to reductions in hospital costs for treatment of fee-for-service 
  Medicare or Medicaid patients under the physicians' clinical care. The legal 
  basis for our interpretation is articulated in the Special Advisory Bulletin 
  and need not be repeated here. As to the commentary's authors' contention that 
  our interpretation ignores the plain language of section 1128A(b), we believe 
  that any honest reader of the broad, unqualified statutory language will concede 
  that it clearly encompasses gainsharing arrangements involving monetary payments 
  by hospitals to physicians conditioned on the physicians reducing their patients' 
  hospital treatment costs. <br>
  <br>
<p>More importantly, the authors' hyper-technical reading of the statute indicates 
  a basic misapprehension of the purposes of the statute. The principal evil addressed 
  by section 1128A(b) is not the actual reduction of services to beneficiaries, 
  but rather the potential for hospital payments to corrupt a treating physician's 
  medical judgment as to the provision of hospital services to his or her patients. 
  In this respect, section 1128A(b) is an analog to the anti-kickback statute, 
  section 1128B(b) of the Act. Thus, as is true with kickbacks, the gravamen of 
  a violation is a knowing payment to a physician to influence his or her treatment 
  of patients. While the physician's compromised judgment <em>may</em> result 
  in the delivery of unnecessary services (in the case of kickbacks) or in "stinting" 
  on services (in the case of a hospital gainsharing plan), proof of actual adverse 
  effects on particular patients is not required under either section. 
<p>The authors' claim that the OIG's interpretation of section 1128A(b) results 
  in unfair discrimination against enrollees in Medicare managed care is equally 
  groundless. Congress' disparate treatment of physician incentive plans offered 
  by Medicare risk-based managed care plans (and their subcontractors) and physician 
  incentive plans offered by hospitals treating Medicare or Medicaid fee-for-service 
  beneficiaries is reasonable and equitable given the differences in the programs.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  A basic premise of the Medicare risk-based managed care program is that beneficiaries 
  who choose to enroll understand that their physicians will have economic incentives 
  with respect to managing their care. In return, however, these managed care 
  beneficiaries share in any savings through increased benefits, such as reduced 
  copayments and outpatient prescription drug coverage. By contrast, fee-for-service 
  beneficiaries incur substantial additional financial obligations (not borne 
  by their managed care counterparts) in exchange for unfettered access to physicians 
  of their choice. Moreover, unlike physician incentive programs under Medicare 
  managed care plans, the entire benefit of the savings from hospital-based physician 
  incentive plans for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries accrues solely to 
  the hospital and the treating physicians; neither the fee-for-service enrollees, 
  nor the Medicare Trust Fund, benefits in any way from these physician incentive 
  programs. Given the substantial differences in the programs, Congress' disparate 
  regulation of incentive plans is understandable. 
<p><strong>The 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.</strong> The authors of the 
  commentary mistakenly claim that the preamble to the 1994 Notice of Proposed 
  Rulemaking ("NPRM") addressing section 1128A(b) (59 Fed. Reg. 61571 (Dec. 1, 
  1994)) is inconsistent with the OIG's position in the Special Advisory Bulletin.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  Specifically, they allege that the preamble demonstrated that the OIG "understood 
  that certain gainsharing agreements -- namely those that contain safeguards 
  suggested in the GAO's 1986 report -- do indeed comply with section 1128A(b), 
  and that a case-by-case analysis is required to determine whether a particular 
  arrangement is legal." Those allegations are plainly wrong. Not only is the 
  preamble to the NPRM completely consistent with the Special Advisory Bulletin, 
  but the preamble language cited by the authors to support their argument has 
  been quoted wholly out of context, creating a false impression. 
<p>Before discussing the substance of the preamble to the NPRM, it is useful to 
  have a basic understanding of its structure. In particular, the section of the 
  preamble that contains the discussion of the proposed rule is clearly divided 
  into two subsections delineated by separate headings. The first subsection addresses 
  the structure and nature of hospital physician incentive plans to be prohibited, 
  while the second subsection discusses the application of the proposed rule to 
  physician incentive plans <em>not relating to direct patient care responsibilities</em>. 
  (59 Fed. Reg. 61573). 
<p>In the first subsection, the preamble made clear the OIG's view that incentive 
  plans that are based on cost savings tied to the overall costs of patient treatment 
  or lengths of stay are flatly prohibited, because they appear to be designed 
  as inducements to reduce or limit services to patients admitted to hospitals 
  and could also influence the type of patient admitted to the hospital. The <em>entire</em> 
  discussion reads as follows: 
<p>"The precise structure and application of a physician incentive plan will ultimately 
  determine whether CMPs would be assessed against a hospital or physician under 
  this provision [section 1128A(b)]. There are certain incentive payments to physicians, 
  based on cost savings, that are specifically designed to limit or reduce services 
  normally provided by a hospital to a patient. Such incentive plans, tied to 
  the overall costs of patient treatment or on a patient's length-of-stay without 
  regard to how specific reductions are made, could be viewed as inducements to 
  reduce patient services, and thus may be subject to CMPs under these regulations. 
  Most DRG incentive plans, for example, under which payment to individual physicians 
  is tied to DRG reimbursement, appear to be based on payments designed as inducements 
  to reduce or limit services provided once a patient has been admitted. This 
  type of incentive plan might also serve to influence the type of patient admitted 
  to a particular hospital, thereby encouraging the physician to admit patients 
  with less complicated conditions to a hospital offering incentives and directing 
  patients with more complicated conditions elsewhere. <em>These types of incentive 
  plans offered by hospitals to individual physicians related to the cost of services 
  provided would be prohibited under this provision and subject to CMPs.</em>" 
  (69 Fed. Reg. 61573) (emphasis added). 
<p>Thus, the preamble to the 1994 NPRM articulated a categorical prohibition on 
  hospital payments to physicians that are based on reductions in costs for treatment 
  of fee-for-service patients <em>under the physicians' direct care</em> -- a 
  position wholly consistent with the Special Advisory Bulletin. Moreover, nowhere 
  in the preamble discussion is there any basis for concluding (as does the commentary) 
  that prohibited physician incentive plans could be immunized if they included 
  some or all of the "safeguards" mentioned in the GAO report.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
<p>Having concluded its discussion of prohibited plans involving <em>payments 
  related to direct patient care</em>, the preamble to the NPRM continues with 
  a new subsection addressing the application of section 1128A(b) to incentive 
  plans that <em>do not involve payments for direct patient care</em>. In that 
  subsection, the OIG recognized that incentive plans that do not involve direct 
  patient care are not covered by section 1128A(b), but noted the difficulty in 
  describing the entire universe of such plans in a regulation: 
<p>"We believe, for example, there may be certain types of hospital incentive 
  plans to physicians, such as those designated to reward the timely review and 
  completion of medical records which do not impact on direct patient care responsibilities 
  or do not affect patient referral patterns, that may be acceptable and therefore 
  not be subject to civil money penalties under this provision. 
<p><em>We believe, however, that it is impossible and impractical for the OIG 
  to specifically indicate in regulations what specific criteria may make up an 
  acceptable hospital physician incentive plan.</em> <em>In setting forth these 
  proposed regulations, we are adopting a similar approach to that which we have 
  used for other existing CMP authorities of closely following the statutory language. 
  As with all CMP cases, the OIG will review and assess the nature and scope of 
  each suspect incentive plan on a case-by-case basis to determine its specific 
  intent and acceptability.</em> An alternative approach would be to specify those 
  kinds of incentive plans that may be exempt from CMP liability. We welcome comments 
  on identifying those types of incentive plans that may not specifically affect 
  direct patient care responsibilities, and thus would not be implicated by the 
  statute." (59 Fed. Reg. 61573) (emphasis added). 
<p>The authors of the commentary cite the italicized language in the above passage 
  to support their argument that the NPRM contradicts the Special Advisory Bulletin. 
  However, in context, the cited language applies only to case-by-case determinations 
  with respect to physician incentive plans <em>that do not involve direct patient 
  care</em> -- an issue wholly irrelevant to the prohibited gainsharing arrangements 
  discussed in the Special Advisory Bulletin. 
<p><strong>The Special Advisory Bulletin and the Advisory Opinion Process.</strong> 
  The authors of the commentary contend that the OIG issued the Special Advisory 
  Bulletin in an improper manner that pre-empted the advisory opinion process 
  and is in some fashion "suspect". The OIG's practice of issuing advisory bulletins, 
  fraud alerts, and other general, industry-wide guidance is well-established 
  and furthers OIG and congressional policy encouraging increased guidance to 
  the industry on fraud and abuse issues. <u>See, e.g.</u>, section 1128D of the 
  Act. Given the widespread interest regarding gainsharing in the industry and 
  the promotion of gainsharing arrangements by various parties, the OIG determined 
  that the issuance of timely general guidance outlining our concerns with one 
  of the most common gainsharing methodologies was the most efficient and appropriate 
  way to communicate with the regulated community. 
<p>The contention that the use of a Special Advisory Bulletin improperly pre-empted 
  the advisory opinion process is without merit. In response to requests for advisory 
  opinions about gainsharing arrangements, the OIG and the Health Care Financing 
  Administration examined and evaluated a number of these complex arrangements. 
  The OIG afforded each arrangement individual and detailed consideration, including, 
  in some cases, reviews by outside consultants and experts engaged both by the 
  OIG and by the advisory opinion requesters themselves. 
<p>Given the clear prohibition in section 1128A(b), the only "favorable" treatment 
  we could afford a gainsharing arrangement of the type described in the advisory 
  opinion requests would be a determination that, notwithstanding the violation 
  of section 1128A(b), we would exercise our prosecutorial discretion and decline 
  to subject the arrangement to sanction. As noted in the Special Advisory Bulletin, 
  such an opinion requires, as a threshold matter, a determination that the arrangement 
  in question poses a minimal risk of fraud or abuse. 
<p>Thus, from the outset, the OIG made clear to the parties requesting the advisory 
  opinions that, in order to be approved, any gainsharing arrangement would have 
  to ensure that the quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries would 
  not be adversely affected. Ultimately, the OIG determined that the quality measures 
  proposed by the requesters were inadequate to guard against adverse effects 
  on quality of care. Among our concerns were that the quality measures proffered 
  (i) were more or less subjective, (ii) would be applied to patient volumes that 
  were insufficient to yield statistically significant results, and (iii) were 
  not subject to independent verification under the various gainsharing proposals. 
<p>Having concluded that none of the arrangements provided sufficient assurance 
  that the care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries would not be adversely 
  affected, the OIG individually apprised the requesting parties of the OIG's 
  conclusions, the pending issuance of the Special Advisory Bulletin, and the 
  available options for handling the pending advisory opinion requests. These 
  options included proceeding with their requests, in which case they would receive 
  an individualized, reasoned -- albeit unfavorable -- opinion and incur the associated 
  costs; withdrawing their requests, which would save them further expense; or 
  revising their requests in light of the prohibition in section 1128A(b). Far 
  from being short-circuited, the process has simply run its course. To date, 
  two requesters have revised their requests, one has withdrawn its request, and 
  the remainder are presumably still considering their choices. 
<p>The commentary further suggests that the OIG's issuance of the Special Advisory 
  Bulletin somehow circumvented the consultation with the Department of Justice 
  that is integral to the advisory opinion process. The authors' implication that 
  the OIG's issuance of the Special Advisory Bulletin was an "end-run" around 
  our Department of Justice partners is simply untrue. The OIG had ongoing discussions 
  with its relevant counterparts at the Department of Justice's Criminal and Civil 
  Divisions with respect to both the pending advisory opinion requests involving 
  gainsharing arrangements and the Special Advisory Bulletin, a fact that the 
  authors could readily have established with a telephone call to the OIG. 
<p>Rather than subverting the advisory opinion process, the Special Advisory Bulletin 
  was a logical outgrowth of the process -- a synthesis of the lessons learned 
  from the study of specific advisory opinion requests. The OIG has long used 
  special industry-wide alerts and guidance to disseminate its views of specific 
  industry-wide practices. Nothing in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
  Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), which established the OIG's advisory opinion process, 
  remotely suggests that Congress intended to preclude the use of these more generalized 
  means of providing guidance to the industry. To the contrary, the same sections 
  of HIPAA that gave the OIG authority to issue advisory opinions also refer to 
  more general guidance, including fraud alerts and safe harbor regulations. <u>See</u> 
  section 1128D of the Act. In short, the use of the advisory opinion process 
  to inform the development and issuance of general guidance is sensible, consistent 
  with congressional policy, and responsive to the industry's expressed desire 
  for OIG guidance on the fraud and abuse laws. 
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * 
<p>In conclusion, we believe that hospitals and physicians involved in or contemplating 
  gainsharing arrangements are well-advised to heed the guidance offered in the 
  Special Advisory Bulletin. As explained there, the OIG interprets section 1128A(b) 
  as prohibiting any physician incentive plan that conditions hospital payments 
  to physicians or physician groups on savings attributable to reductions in hospital 
  costs for treatment of fee-for-service Medicare or Medicaid patients under their 
  clinical care. To the extent that parties may have entered into improper arrangements 
  in the mistaken belief that they were lawful, the OIG has indicated that it 
  will take into account the prompt unwinding of such arrangements in its enforcement 
  decisions. Parties seeking assurance that their arrangements do not run afoul 
  of section 1128A(b) or other OIG anti-fraud and abuse authorities are encouraged 
  to request an advisory opinion. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>FOOTNOTES:</strong> <a name="N_1_"></a> 
<p>1. Section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act reads: 
<p>"(b)(1) If a hospital or critical access hospital knowingly makes a payment, 
  directly or indirect, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit services 
  provided with respect to individuals who -- 
<p>(A) are entitled to benefits under part A or part B of title XVIII or to medical 
  assistance under a State plan approved under Title XIX, and 
<p>(B) are under the direct care of the physician, 
<p>the hospital or a critical access hospital shall be subject, in addition to 
  any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a civil money penalty 
  of not more than $2,000 for each such individual with respect to whom the payment 
  is made." <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. Medicare risk-based managed care plans are regulated by section 1876(i)(8) 
  of the Act and the corresponding regulations at 42 C.F.R. &#167; 417.479. (Medicaid 
  managed care plans and Medicare+Choice coordinated care plans are regulated 
  under comparable provisions. <u>See</u>, as to Medicaid, section 1903(m)(2)(A)(x) 
  of the Act and 42 C.F.R. &#167; 434.70, and as to Medicare+Choice, section 1852(j)(4) 
  of the Act and 63 Fed. Reg. 34968, 35002 (June 26, 1998) (interim final rule)). 
  To the extent that hospitals have physician incentive plans that make payments 
  that are based on treatment of both managed care (whether Medicare risk-based, 
  Medicaid, or Medicare+Choice coordinated care plans) beneficiaries and Medicare 
  or Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries, any payments that relate to, or potentially 
  affect, the provision of clinical care services for the fee-for-service beneficiaries 
  would implicate section 1128A(b). <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. A final rule has not been promulgated. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. Indeed, the only references to the GAO report in the NPRM are contained 
  in the initial, descriptive background section. That discussion summarizes the 
  report and concludes: 
<p>"The GAO recommended that physician incentive plans that do not include these 
  characteristics should be prohibited. However, the GAO also noted that no combination 
  of characteristics in a physician incentive plan could guarantee that the plan 
  would not be abusive." (59 Fed. Reg. 61572). 
<p>There is no other reference to the GAO report in the entire NPRM, and nowhere 
  in the NPRM does the OIG state or imply that physician incentive plans that 
  contained the safeguards would be deemed in compliance with section 1128A(b). 
  In addition, the suggestion in the commentary that a GAO staff report issued 
  <em>prior</em> to enactment of section 1128A(b) could give rise to "settled 
  law" is most peculiar. <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/bottom.lbi" -->
