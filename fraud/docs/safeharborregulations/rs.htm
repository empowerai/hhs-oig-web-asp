  Clinical Laboratories and SNFs <br>
  <br>
  Dear [Name redacted]: <br>
  <br>
  I write in response to your letter dated September 14, 1999, in which you asked 
  several questions regarding certain arrangements between clinical laboratories 
  and skilled nursing facilities (&quot;SNFs&quot;) paid under the Prospective 
  Payment System (&quot;PPS&quot;) for patients covered under Medicare Part A. 
  In particular, you have inquired about the applicability of OIG Advisory Opinion 
  99-2 (Feb. 26, 1999), which addressed a discount arrangement involving ambulance 
  services, to similar arrangements involving laboratories, and you seek clarification 
  with respect to the kinds of discounts that are prohibited under the anti-kickback 
  statute. <br>
  <br>
  An advisory opinion applies only to the specific arrangement about which the 
  opinion is sought and is only binding on the party or parties requesting the 
  opinion. We do not provide formal legal guidance about such arrangements outside 
  the scope of the advisory opinion process. We issue advisory opinions regarding 
  the anti-kickback statute's application to specific arrangements pursuant to 
  procedures set forth in regulations at 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. The regulations 
  are also available on our web page at http://www.hhs.gov/oig. Requests must 
  be submitted by parties actually participating in the arrangement or by parties 
  who certify a good faith intent to enter into the arrangement if a favorable 
  advisory opinion is issued. <br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding, we can make some general observations about Advisory Opinion 
  99-2. In general, the analytical framework set forth in Advisory Opinion 99-2 
  would apply to arrangements between SNFs and any ancillary services provider, 
  including, but not limited to, clinical laboratories. At issue in Advisory Opinion 
  99-2 were ambulance service contracts that joined discounts to the SNFs for 
  ambulance services for PPS-covered patients with referrals of lucrative Part 
  B business that the ambulance company could bill directly to Medicare at an 
  undiscounted rate. The arrangements fell squarely within the anti-kickback statute: 
  the ambulance provider was giving something of value to the SNF (a discount 
  on PPS-covered business) that was tied to referrals of the SNF's Part B ambulance 
  business. In such circumstances, an unscrupulous provider may have an incentive 
  to overutilize services or to increase Federal costs by improper billing (such 
  as, in the case of ambulances, billing for more expensive forms of transport 
  than are necessary) to make up potential losses on the discounted PPS business. 
  These are some of the very evils that the anti-kickback statute is designed 
  to prevent. <br>
  <br>
  As explained in the opinion, a key inquiry under the anti-kickback statute is 
  whether the discount on the PPS-covered business is intended to induce the referral 
  of Part B business. Neither the size nor structure of the discount is determinative 
  of an anti-kickback violation. Rather, the appropriate question to ask is whether 
  the discount -- regardless of its size or structure -- is tied or linked directly 
  or indirectly to referrals of other Federal health care program business. <br>
  <br>
  When evaluating whether an improper connection exists between a discount on 
  PPS-covered business and referrals of Part B business, we look for indicia that 
  the discount on the PPS-covered business is not commercially reasonable in the 
  absence of other, non-discounted business. <u>In other words, we look to see 
  whether the discount on the PPS-covered services makes business sense &quot;standing 
  alone&quot; without reference to any other business the provider may receive 
  from the SNF.</u> <br>
  <br>
  Advisory Opinion 99-2 identified two examples of discounts that are suspect:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">discounts that are below the supplier's fully loaded costs, 
      and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">discounts that are lower than the prices that the supplier 
      offers to a buyer that (i) generates a volume of business for the supplier 
      that is the same or greater than the volume of Part A business generated 
      by the PPS SNF, but (ii) does not have any potentially available Part B 
      or other Federal health care program business.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In the absence of other facts to the contrary, these kinds of discounts suggest 
  that the supplier and the SNF may be &quot;swapping&quot; discounts on PPS-covered 
  business in exchange for profitable non-discounted Part B business, from which 
  the supplier can recoup losses incurred on the discounted business, potentially 
  through overutilization or abusive billing practices. These two discount arrangements 
  were intended as examples of suspect discounts. Other suspect practices include, 
  but are not limited to, discounts that are coupled with exclusive provider agreements 
  and discounts or other pricing schemes (such as capitation arrangements) made 
  in conjunction with explicit or implicit agreements to refer other facility 
  business. In sum, if <u>any</u> direct or indirect link exists between a price 
  offered to a SNF for PPS-covered services and referrals of Part B business, 
  the anti-kickback statute would be implicated. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, you asked whether a laboratory may pass along to a SNF cost savings 
  (if any) resulting from billing a SNF directly under the PPS system <u>if the 
  intent of providing this cost savings discount is to induce the referral of 
  Part B services</u>. In general, the anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), 
  makes it a criminal offense knowingly and wilfully to offer, pay, solicit, or 
  receive any remuneration (i.e., anything of value) to induce, or in return for, 
  the referral of items or services for which payment may be made in whole or 
  in part by a Federal health care program. In other words, the statute prohibits 
  payments made purposefully to induce referrals of business paid for by a Federal 
  health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid. The statute has been interpreted 
  by courts to cover any arrangement where <u>one</u> purpose of the remuneration 
  is to induce referrals. Because the anti-kickback statute is an intent-based 
  statute, the determination whether a particular payment practice violates the 
  statute can only be made on a case-by-case basis after reviewing all potentially 
  relevant facts to determine the intent of the parties. </p>
<p align="left">We are continuing to monitor the situation with respect to potentially 
  unlawful contracts between SNFs and services providers, as well as the potential 
  ramifications of these arrangements under the prohibition on charging Medicare 
  or Medicaid amounts substantially in excess of a provider's usual charge (section 
  1128(b)(6) of the Social Security Act). <br>
  <br>
  I hope this information is helpful. If you have further questions or comments, 
  please feel free to contact me at 202-619-0335.</p>
