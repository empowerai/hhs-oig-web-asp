<p>Assistant General Counsel

<p>Dear John: 
<p>I am responding to your letter of July 20, 1993, requesting assistance in interpreting 
  the scope of prohibited referrals under the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback 
  statute with respect to the acquisition of physician practices. The focus of 
  your inquiry was the position taken in my December 22, 1992 letter to T. J. 
  Sullivan at the Internal Revenue Service that payments for intangible assets 
  or goodwill were open to question under the anti-kickback statute, and my subsequent 
  oral comments on this issue. 
<p>In particular, in your letter you presented two specific situations involving 
  the acquisition of a physician's practice. The first situation involved the 
  purchase of a physician practice by another physician or a group practice. I 
  have assumed the acquiring practice is not in a position to benefit from referrals 
  by the acquired practice. After reaching agreement on the price for the hard 
  assets, the parties proceed to value the remainder of the practice and assign 
  a value for the expectation of future patronage by patients to the practice 
  being acquired. The total price negotiated for the practice includes an amount 
  for both the hard assets and the intangible assets. You described this situation 
  as involving a "one-step" referral, a situation where the patients "self-refer" 
  because of word of mouth about the physician or because another unrelated physician 
  refers to the practice. 
<p>The second situation involves the acquisition of the same or a similar physician 
  practice, except that the purchaser is a hospital, which is in a position to 
  benefit from referrals by the acquired practice. The same valuation method is 
  used to determine the purchase price. Even though the hospital can be expected 
  to receive admissions and referrals from the practice, the value of these referrals 
  are not used in the valuation of the practice. Only the expected future patronage 
  <u>to</u> the practice is included and the hospital does not pay more for the 
  practice than would another physician. This situation is described as involving 
  a "two-step" referral process, one to the practice and a second one to the hospital. 
<p>You sought an opinion clarifying whether the payments made in either or both 
  of these situations would be allowable under the anti-kickback statute. As you 
  know, the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) of the 
  Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b), makes it a criminal offense to knowingly 
  and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive remuneration to induce, or in 
  return for, the referral of business covered by Medicare or Medicaid. 
<p>For a number of reasons, we are not in a position to issue advisory or interpretive 
  opinions on whether a particular practice or arrangement violates the anti-kickback 
  statute. One reason is that since section 1128B(b) is a criminal statute, the 
  Department of Justice has exclusive authority to initiate a criminal prosecution 
  or decline to do so under the statute. Another reason is that the statute requires 
  proof of knowing and willful intent, and it is generally impossible to evaluate 
  intent on the basis of a paper submission. Finally, in reviewing a particular 
  arrangement, we cannot be sure that we have all the necessary information concerning 
  the nature of the arrangement or practice and how it operates in order to make 
  a proper decision concerning its legality or illegality. 
<p>I would like to emphasize that the position I articulated in the December 22, 
  1992 letter to T. J. Sullivan remains the same. I did not state that payments 
  for intangible assets are illegal per se. Nor have I indicated approval of any 
  particular acquisition practices or valuation methodologies. Since payments 
  for items other than the hard assets of a physician practice <u>could</u> be 
  a payment to induce referrals or <u>could</u> be in return for future referrals, 
  any such payments are subject to scrutiny to determine whether they violate 
  the anti-kickback statute. The fact that the parties may identify the purpose 
  of the payment as something other than a payment for referrals is not determinative. 
<p>Similarly, the fact that two different parties may offer to pay the same price 
  for a particular or a comparable physician practice or may use a similar approach 
  in "valuing" the practice does not mean that both will be afforded the same 
  treatment under the anti-kickback statute. The intent of the parties is the 
  critical element in the determination of a violation under the anti-kickback 
  statute, and different parties may have different purposes and reasons for seeking 
  to acquire a particular physician practice and for paying a particular price. 
  Finally, the facts and circumstances involved in each situation are likely to 
  be different as will be the nature of the relationship between the parties. 
  Consequently, each particular situation must be judged on its own merits and 
  based on its own facts and circumstances. 
<p>Turning to the two situations described above, we believe the first situation 
  is far less problematic than the second. However, either situation <u>could</u> 
  constitute a violation of the anti-kickback statute, depending on the intent 
  of the parties, the nature of the intangible assets, the amounts paid for the 
  intangible assets, and the past and future relationship of the parties, etc. 
  One major factor is where the seller becomes or remains affiliated with the 
  buyer. In such a case, the terms of that continued affiliation as well as the 
  remuneration paid to the seller for services rendered would also need to be 
  taken into account in determining whether a violation exists. 
<p>With respect to the second situation involving the purchase of the practice 
  by a hospital, anytime an entity is acquiring a practice where the entity is 
  in a position to benefit from referrals from the practice, there is always a 
  question that a portion of the amount paid for the practice is attributable 
  to the future referrals. As indicated above, it is the intent of the parties 
  and the facts and circumstances of the particular acquisition that are relevant. 
  Accordingly, the fact that a hospital purchases a physician practice for the 
  same amount that another physician might pay does not insulate the hospital 
  from liability under the anti-kickback statute. For example, another physician 
  may offer a high price based on the savings in administrative costs and overhead 
  which could be realized by combining practices. However, a hospital may not 
  have that motivation at all; its offer of the <u>same</u>price could be motivated 
  by a desire to pay for future referrals. 
<p>We hope this information is helpful and regret that we are unable to provide 
  further guidance. Thank you for your interest in this matter.
