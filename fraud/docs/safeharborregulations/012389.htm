  <br>
<p>AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS, Office of Inspector General (OIG). 
<p>ACTION: Proposed rule. 
<p>SUMMARY: These proposed regulations are designed to implement section 14 of 
  Pub. L. 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act 
  of 1987, by specifying various payment practices which, although potentially 
  capable of inducing referrals of business under Medicare, would not be considered 
  kickbacks for purposes of criminal prosecution or civil remedies.

  <br>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<p>I. Background 
<p>Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, previously codified at sections 
  1877 and 1909, provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that 
  knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration in order 
  to induce business reimbursed under the Medicare or State health care programs. 
  The offense is classified as a felony, and is punishable by fines of up to $25,000 
  and imprisonment for up to 5 years. 
<p>This provision is extremely broad. The types of remuneration covered specifically 
  include kickbacks, bribes, and rebates made directly or indirectly, overtly 
  or covertly, or in cash or in kind. In addition, prohibited conduct includes 
  not only remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients, but remuneration 
  also intended to induce the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for 
  any good, facility, service, or item paid by Medicare or State health care programs. 
<p>The leading case regarding this statute illustrates its broad scope. In <em>United 
  States v. Greber</em>, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 474 U.S. 
  988, 106 S.Ct. 396 (1985), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was asked to examine 
  the nature of payments between a medical diagnostic company, providing holter 
  monitor services, and physicians. The company billed Medicare for the monitoring 
  service it performed, and forwarded 40 percent of those payments (up to $65 
  per patient) to the referring physician. 
<p>The defendant in this case alleged that these payments were merely "interpretation 
  fees" paid to the referring physicians for their initial consultation and for 
  explaining the test results to the patients. <em>Id</em>. at 70. The court, 
  however, declined to examine whether there might have been a legitimate purpose 
  behind those payments, concluding: "if one purpose of the payment is to induce 
  future referrals, the medicare statute has been violated." <em>Id</em>. at 69. 
<p>Since the statute on its face is so broad, and the court has recognized its 
  full breadth, concern has arisen among a number of health care providers that 
  many relatively innocuous, or even beneficial, commercial arrangements are technically 
  covered by the statute and are, therefore, subject to criminal prosecution. 
<p>Public Law 100-93 
<p>Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection 
  Act of 1987, added two new provisions addressing the anti-kickback statute. 
  Section 2 specifically provided new authority to the Office of Inspector General 
  (OIG) to exclude a person or entity from participation in the Medicare and State 
  health care programs if it is determined that the party is engaged in a prohibited 
  remuneration scheme. This new sanction authority is intended to provide an alternative 
  civil remedy, short of criminal prosecution, that will be a more effective way 
  of regulating abusive business practices than is the case under criminal law. 
<p>In addition, section 14 of Pub.L. 100-93 requires the promulgation of regulations 
  specifying those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal prosecution 
  under section 1128B of the Act and that will not provide a basis for exclusion 
  from the Medicare program or from the State health care programs under section 
  1128(b)(7). This section reflects the generally accepted view that the language 
  proscribing remuneration that induces referrals is so broadly written as to 
  encompass many harmless or efficient arrangements as well. 
<p>In accordance with the stipulation of Pub.L. 100-93, these proposed regulations 
  have been developed in<strong></strong> consultation with the Department of 
  Justice. 
<p>Notice of Intent 
<p>The legislative history of section 14 of Pub.L. 100-93 indicates that Congress 
  expected the Department of Health and Human Services to consult with affected 
  provider, practitioner, supplier and beneficiary representatives before promulgating 
  regulations. In order to most effectively address issues related to this provision, 
  we published a notice of intent to develop regulations (52 FR 38794, October 
  21, 1987) soliciting comments from interested parties prior to developing proposed 
  regulations. As a result of that notice, the OIG received a total of 137 timely 
  comments, recommendations and suggestions on generic criteria that can be applied 
  to particular types of business arrangements in order to determine if such arrangements 
  are inappropriate for civil or criminal sanctions. 
<p>II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
<p>We are proposing to amend 42 CFR Part 1001 by adding a new &#167; 1001.952 
  to set forth those specific payment practices that would not be treated as a 
  criminal offense under section 1128B of the Act and would not serve as the basis 
  for an exclusion from the Medicare and State health care programs. Before we 
  discuss the various payment practices that we are proposing to exempt, we will 
  clarify the effect of not having a particular business arrangement exempted, 
  and we invite public comments on the issues of continuing guidance, notice to 
  beneficiaries, and preferred provider organizations. 
<p>Business Arrangements Not Exempt 
<p>We are aware that it is the unique position physicians occupy in the medical 
  marketplace that has led to the examination of their relationship with varying 
  business arrangements. It is the physician who controls access to a large array 
  of medical items and services in order for third party reimbursement to be available. 
  This is a highly competitive market that is constantly expanding with new drugs, 
  medical devices and tests. While this competitive marketplace is important, 
  it is necessary for the fiscal integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
  to assure that physicians exercise sound, objective medical judgment when controlling 
  admittance to this market. We have attempted in these proposed regulations to 
  permit physicians to freely engage in business practices and arrangements that 
  encourage competition, innovation and economy. However, we have added criteria 
  to each "safe harbor" in order to reduce the potential for abuse. 
<p>In order for a business arrangement to comply with one of the exemptions set 
  forth below, each provision of that exemption must be met. If, however, the 
  business arrangement involves several payments, for example, rental of both 
  space and equipment, then each payment will be analyzed to determine if all 
  the provisions of each applicable exemption have been fulfilled. Thus, fully 
  complying with one exemption may not grant that individual or entity complete 
  immunity under the statute. 
<p>Several commenters responding to our notice of intent have asked that we clarify 
  what it means if a particular business arrangement does not fully comply with 
  each element of a particular exemption. In many instances, the failure to comply 
  fully with one of the exemptions will be of no consequence because the arrangement 
  does not fall within the proscriptions of the statute at all. However, where 
  individuals and entities have entered into arrangements that are covered by 
  the statute, where they have chosen not to fully comply with one of the exemptions 
  proposed in these regulations, they would risk scrutiny by the OIG and may be 
  subject to civil or criminal enforcement action. 
<p>Continuing Guidance 
<p>Congress intended that the regulations set forth on "safe harbors" be an evolving 
  rule that would be periodically updated to reflect changing business practices 
  and technologies. In the House Committee Report accompanying Pub.L. 100-93, 
  the Committee stated that it "believes that a mechanism for periodic public 
  input is necessary to ensure that the regulations remain relevant in light of 
  changes in health care delivery and payment and to ensure that published interpretations 
  of the law are not impeding legitimate and beneficial activities. Accordingly, 
  the Committee expects that the Secretary will formally reevaluate the anti-kickback 
  regulations on a periodic basis and, in doing so, will solicit public comments 
  at the outset of the review process." 
<p>We, therefore, invite public comments on how we can best achieve the twin goals 
  of keeping the industry aware of our views of particular business practices, 
  and assuring that our regulations remain current with new developments. Comments 
  should address how affected parties can make their questions or views known 
  on a continuing or regular basis, and how the Department can best respond to 
  such concerns. 
<p>Notice to Beneficiaries 
<p>We considered including in several of the proposed "safe harbors" a requirement 
  that a person notify each Medicare beneficiary or Medicaid State health care 
  program of the financial relationship that exists and any person to whom he 
  or she refers the beneficiary for items or services. This requirement may serve 
  to provide an additional safeguard against the abuse for which there is always 
  some potential when such financial relationships exist. Furthermore, it reiterates 
  the ethical responsibility of physicians as reflected in the Current Opinions 
  of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association, 
  and it is a duty imposed by some State statutes as well. <br>
  <br>
<p>However, such notice requirements may be unduly burdensome compared with the 
  potential benefits to health care consumers. We therefore have not included 
  the requirement in the ownership and financial relationship safe harbors at 
  this time. However, we invite public comments on this issue. 
<p>Preferred Provider Organizations 
<p>We are aware that there are an increasing variety of arrangements among providers 
  grouped under the generic headings "preferred provider organizations" (PPOs) 
  or "managed care." Unlike HMOs, PPOs and managed care arrangements do not have 
  a single unique identifying structure or concept. In addition, unlike HMOs, 
  there is no single entity that is recognized as the "provider." For these reasons, 
  there is no safe harbor specifically delineated for these arrangements. Rather, 
  we believe that the safe harbors we have designated would cover many relationships 
  in preferred provider and managed care networks. Furthermore, the anti-kickback 
  statute would not apply to participants in PPOs where the discounts and financial 
  relationships are obviously not designed to improperly induce referrals. However, 
  we invite comments from the public regarding additional safe harbors that would 
  provide further assurance to PPOs. 
<p>Relationship to Other Laws 
<p>The safe harbors being proposed in these regulations are only for purposes 
  of the Federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. They would not provide 
  immunity from civil or criminal<strong></strong> prosecution or other sanctions 
  under any other Federal or State laws. For example, a particular arrangement 
  permissible under a safe harbor may violate a law administered by the Federal 
  Trade Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or may run 
  afoul of a State law that is applied by the State in a stricter fashion than 
  the Federal law. 
<p>Proposed Safe Harbors 
<p>Set forth below is a description of the various payment practices that we are 
  proposing to exempt and the rationale for their inclusion in this proposed rulemaking. 
<p>A. Investment Interests 
<p>As written, the anti-kickback provision applicable to the Medicare and State 
  health care programs is so broad that it could be interpreted literally, for 
  example, to prohibit a physician from receiving dividend payments from a large 
  publicly traded pharmaceutical company if he or she prescribed one of the company's 
  products for a Medicaid patient, knowing that ordering that product would increase 
  his or her dividend payment. 
<p>We do not believe that Congress intended to bar all forms of investment or 
  ownership by referral sources in health providers. This conclusion is based 
  on the fact that there are other provisions of Medicare law that pertain specifically 
  to physician-owned home health agencies. Obviously, these provisions would make 
  little sense if the kickback provision prohibited, <em>per se</em>, referrals 
  by physicians to entities in which they had any investment interest. 
<p>To reflect this view that Congress did not intend to absolutely bar any investment 
  by physicians in other health care entities, we have included a "safe harbor" 
  for investment interests in large public corporations. We have done this to 
  assure that the companies are sufficiently large enough so that the return on 
  investment is, at most, tangentially related to any referrals of items or services 
  made by a shareholder, for example, the prescribing of a drug by an investing 
  physician. This "safe harbor" describes a minimum number of shareholders and 
  a minimum amount of assets the company must have in order to qualify under this 
  exemption. We have adopted the same bright line employed by the SEC. The SEC 
  applies these same standards to determine which companies are required to register 
  with it, regardless of whether they are traded on a national securities exchange 
  (15 U.S.C. 78l(g) and 17 CFR 240.12g-1). We believe this bright line will be 
  useful to health care providers as it sets forth a standard for permissible 
  investments under this "safe harbor" that can be easily determined. <br>
  <br>
<p>On the other hand, many commenters have described to us situations where health 
  care entities sell limited partnership interests at nominal cost solely to investors 
  who are in a position to make referrals to the entity, and where the profit 
  distribution in the first year, and each year thereafter, is substantially in 
  excess of the original investment. Competitors of these entities complain of 
  losing a significant share of the market to an entity that establishes a limited 
  partnership with physicians in the service area. We have been urged not to include 
  a "safe harbor" for such practices. 
<p>Therefore, under the proposed rule, referrals by physicians to entities in 
  which they have any kind of investment interest (other than in large corporations 
  available to the general public), such as limited partnerships, would be subject 
  to prosecution under the same circumstances as they have been until now under 
  section 1128B of the Social Security Act. 
<p>However, we are considering crafting an additional exemption to the anti-kickback 
  statute for certain limited partnerships and managing partnership interests 
  that operate according to standards we would prescribe to assure minimum risk 
  of abuse. Accordingly, we are interested in receiving comments suggesting what 
  those standards should be. This "safe harbor" might include: (1) Investment 
  in an entity such as a limited partnership where a bona fide opportunity to 
  invest is made on an equal basis to people in a position to make referrals as 
  well as others, where there are no requirements to make referrals, where there 
  has been disclosure to a referred patient, and where payments are not related 
  to referrals; and (2) managing partnership interests where there is a disclosure 
  to a referred patient, and where payments are not related to referrals. 
<p>B. Space Rental 
<p>The anti-kickback statute is so broadly written that it could be interpreted 
  to cover rental payments where one party is in a position to make referrals 
  to the other party, even if there is no explicit or implicit understanding regarding 
  referrals. While many rental arrangements are legitimate, we have been informed 
  of many situations where rental payments were simply a device used to mask the 
  real nature of the payments, that is, to induce referrals. 
<p>Some examples of these kinds of arrangements are where: (1) A health care entity 
  rents space at a rate above market value from a physician by the hour-- with 
  the space being used solely to provide care or services to patients referred 
  by the physician--and the hours per week, and thus the payments, varying in 
  direct relationship to the number of referrals; (2) a physician rents space 
  to a health care entity at a rate above what the market would ordinarily bear, 
  but the entity agrees to the high rent because of an understanding that the 
  physician will refer his or her patients to that entity; or (3) a physician 
  rents space to a health care entity on a month-to- month lease, with the rent 
  varying each month based on the number of referrals from the physician in the 
  preceding month. These arrangements obviously fall within the scope of the anti-kickback 
  law, and provide the potential to abuse the Medicare and State health care programs. 
<p>Typically, the abusive arrangements involve rental payments either substantially 
  in excess or below the fair market value of the rental space. The Ninth Circuit 
  Court of Appeals, in <em>United States v. Lipkis</em>, 770 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir. 
  1985), emphasized the importance of determining fair market value when assessing 
  the legitimacy of payments between parties who are in a position to make referrals. 
  In <em>Lipkis</em>, a medical management company providing services to a physician 
  group entered into an arrangement with a laboratory where the laboratory returned 
  20 percent of its revenues obtained from the physician group's referrals back 
  to the management company. The defendant alleged that these payments were fair 
  compensation for "specimen collection and handling services." <em>Id</em>. at 
  1449. The court rejected this defense, concluding: "The fair market value of 
  these services was substantially less than the [amount paid], and there is no 
  question that [the laboratory] was paying for referrals as well as the described 
  services." <em>Ibid.</em> Accordingly, one fundamental principle is whether 
  the payment is based on fair market value, regardless of whether the payment 
  is for space rental, equipment rental, personal services, or management contracts. 
<p>We have, therefore, crafted an exemption to the anti-kickback law in these 
  proposed regulations for rental arrangements that would require certain standards 
  and safeguards in order to limit the opportunity for abusive relationships that 
  are intended to induce referrals. Proposed &#167; 1001.952(b), Rent,<strong> 
  </strong>specifically would establish "safe harbors" in cases of rental agreements 
  where: (1) In instances when access is for periodic intervals, those intervals 
  are set in advance in the lease, rather than allowed to vary week-to-week on 
  the basis of the number of referred patients to be served at the premises; (2) 
  the lease is for at least one year so it cannot be readjusted every month based 
  on the number of referrals; and (3) the charges reflect fair market value. 
<p>C. Equipment Rental 
<p>Diagnostic and other items of medical equipment are sometimes rented rather 
  than purchased. Obviously, there is no per se violation of the anti-kickback 
  statute solely because the owner of the equipment refers a patient to the entity 
  who is paying the individual rent for the equipment. However, we have had situations 
  brought to our attention where payment for the use of the equipment, just like 
  rent for space, is simply a vehicle to provide reimbursement for referrals. 
<p>For example, we have had described to us arrangements where a provider rents 
  equipment from a hospital and reimburses the hospital on an hourly basis each 
  time he or she uses the equipment. Under this type of arrangement, the hospital 
  knows it will be paid a fee by the provider each time it refers a patient to 
  the provider for services requiring the use of the equipment. In another case, 
  an ophthalmologist may rent diagnostic equipment to an optometrist at a rate 
  significantly below the usual market rate. In this instance, there is an understanding 
  between the parties that the rate will be adjusted periodically depending on 
  the referral rate of patients from the optometrist to the ophthalmologist. The 
  reduction in the rental charge, which becomes larger as the number of referrals 
  increase, could obviously be construed as the offer of remuneration in order 
  to induce referrals. 
<p>We have, therefore, provided in &#167; 1001.952(c), a "safe harbor" for equipment 
  rentals similar to those applied to real estate rental discussed above, along 
  with the appropriate conditions and safeguards to limit the potential for abuse. 
<p>D. Personal Services/Management Contracts 
<p>Medical practitioners and providers often have agreements to perform services 
  for each other on a mutually beneficial basis. Sometimes these agreements call 
  for the party requiring the service to pay a fixed amount or hourly rate to 
  the party performing the service. In other instances, both parties may be allegedly 
  contributing some service or benefit to a so-called "joint venture," and taking 
  compensation in the form of a share of the profits generated by the venture. 
  In still other situations, a party may perform a service acting in the capacity 
  of agent for a company. For example, the agent may perform management services 
  for the company, or handle certain billing and collection services. 
<p>None of these arrangements is <em>per se</em> illegal solely because referrals 
  between the parties, or to the joint venture, occur. However, if the nature 
  of the agreement is such that payments are intended to induce referrals, or 
  there is an implicit or explicit arrangement where the amount of the payment 
  varies with the volume of referral, the anti-kickback law would apply. 
<p>Examples of abusive arrangements that would fall into this category are where: 
  (1) An orthopedist is under contract with a physical therapist to provide billing 
  services for patients he or she refers for the service, thereby receiving compensation 
  in an amount that varies directly with the volume of the referrals; (2) a hospital-employed 
  respiratory therapist is paid by a supplier for servicing home oxygen equipment, 
  but only in cases where the therapist is the source of the patient referral; 
  and (3) a hospital stores and delivers medical equipment to discharged patients 
  on behalf of a supplier and is compensated through a disproportionate share 
  of the net profits of the supplier, although the hospital's only other "service" 
  to the joint venture is the referral of the discharged patients. The variations 
  on these examples are virtually limitless. <br>
  <br>
<p>We have established in &#167; 1001.952(d) a "safe harbor" for joint ventures 
  and other arrangements involving payments for personal services or management 
  contracts, but only if certain standards are met and safeguards are present 
  to limit the opportunity to provide financial incentives in exchange for referrals. 
  This exemption includes the determination of whether services are paid at fair 
  market value, and is predicated on the same type of standards and qualifications 
  as set forth in the exemption for space and equipment rental. 
<p>E. Sale of Practice 
<p>It has been brought to our attention that another approach sometimes employed 
  by hospitals to assure a referral of business is to buy, or appear to buy, a 
  physician's practice. Unlike the traditional sale of a practice by a retiring 
  physician to another physician, in these cases the physician continues to practice 
  on the staff of the hospital. Thus, the hospital is able to assure that it will 
  be the provider of both physician services and any hospital services required 
  by any of the physician's patients. The physician's patients, in most cases, 
  may be totally unaware that the physician has "sold" his or her practice to 
  the hospital. Further, such sales often involve much higher rates of compensation 
  that would be the case if a retiring physician sold a comparable practice to 
  another physician. The additional compensation in these instances reflects the 
  value of the referrals. 
<p>Another approach in the sale of a practice is for the hospital to pay a practicing 
  physician a monthly fee to keep alive its so-called "option" to purchase his 
  or her practice. We have been advised that in these situations neither party 
  intends for the hospital to ever exercise its option, but that the payments 
  are for referrals and will continue only so long as the physician meets his 
  or her monthly quota of referrals. 
<p>We are also aware of practices between practitioners such as optometrists and 
  ophthalmologists whereby the ophthalmologist "buys" the optometrist's practice, 
  but the optometrist keeps practicing, only now substantially salaried by the 
  ophthalmologist. The only purpose of this sale was to lock up referrals. 
<p>The "safe harbor" we are proposing in &#167; 1001.952(f) would exist for the 
  sale of physician practices when occurring as the result of retirement or some 
  other event that removes the physician from the practice of medicine or from 
  the service area in which he or she was practicing, but not when the sale is 
  for the purpose of obtaining an ongoing source of patient referrals. 
<p>F. Referral Services 
<p>Professional societies and other consumer-oriented groups often operate referral 
  services, with a fee sometimes paid to cover the costs of such a service. Because 
  such a service fee could be construed as a payment in order to obtain a referral, 
  we have concluded that it is appropriate to establish a specific "safe harbor" 
  for this type of practice. The proposed regulations at &#167; 1001.952(g), Referral 
  services, provides standards and safeguards to assure that the "safe harbor" 
  is not abused by persons who would attempt to operate exclusive or selective 
  referral services for which they would impose high participation fees. 
<p><strong></strong>G. Warranties 
<p>We believe that it is in the public interest to have companies offer warranties 
  as an inducement to the consumer to purchase a product. Section 1001.952(h) 
  reflects this belief and provides a "safe harbor" for such purposes. We are 
  aware, however, that some companies, such as some pacemaker manufacturers, offer 
  so-called "warranties" on other manufacturers' products. The reason this occurs 
  is that the Medicare program will reimburse the full costs of a replacement 
  product. As a result, if a patient has no out-of-pocket expenses, he or she 
  can easily be persuaded to make use of another manufacturer's product, and the 
  manufacturer can, in turn, look to the Medicare program for reimbursement. These 
  so-called warranties do not meet the Federal Trade Commission definition of 
  warranty, and these regulations would not provide a "safe harbor" for such warranties. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>H. Waiver of Deductibles for Inpatient Hospital Care 
<p>With the advent of the prospective payment system in 1984 for reimbursing hospitals 
  for inpatient care, some hospitals have advertised the routine waiver of Medicare 
  coinsurance and deductible amounts as a means of attracting patients to their 
  facilities. Because the Federal anti-kickback statute does not distinguish between 
  categories of individuals who are prohibited from receiving something of value 
  as an inducement to arrange for care from a particular provider, as a technical 
  matter, the statute prohibits hospitals from engaging in this kind of practice. 
<p>This discrepancy between the technical prohibition on waivers of deductibles 
  and the practices of some hospitals resulted in many comments. Commenters requested 
  policies ranging from complete prohibition to permitting widespread use of waivers. 
<p>At this time, we have not included a "safe harbor" for waiving deductibles 
  for inpatient hospital care in this proposed rule. However, we solicit comments 
  on defining a waiver of deductible "safe harbor" that would be limited to inpatient 
  hospital care, include only the deductible amount, be available to all Medicare 
  beneficiaries without regard to diagnosis or length of stay, and assure that 
  any costs to the hospital of waiving the deductible would not be passed on to 
  any Federal program as a bad debt or in any other way. With respect to other 
  situations where deductibles or copayments are routinely waived (such as Part 
  B deductibles and copayments), we believe the anti-kickback statute is clearly 
  violated. 
<p>I. Discounts, Employees and Group Purchasing Organizations 
<p>The "safe harbors" relating to discounts, employees and group purchasing organizations 
  are specifically required under section 1128B of the Act. The proposed regulations, 
  at &#167; 1001.952(i), (j), and (k), respectively, set forth guidance on the 
  scope of these exemptions. 
<p>1. Discounts. The proposed discount exemption we are proposing is intended 
  to meet the legislative intent of encouraging price competition that benefits 
  the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>The exemption applies to individuals and entities, including providers, who 
  solicit or receive price reductions, and to individuals and entities who offer 
  or pay them. However, while the exemption places certain requirements on individuals 
  or entities who solicit or receive the discount, we are not proposing any requirements 
  on the individuals or entities offering or paying it in order for them to qualify 
  for the exemption. In addition, the exemption also applies regardless whether 
  the discount is offered for bulk purchases, prompt payment or other purposes, 
  and whether the buyer buys directly from the seller or through a group purchasing 
  organization. 
<p>This proposed discount exemption closely follows the statutory language, limiting 
  its application to reductions in the amount a seller charges in a specific transaction 
  for a good or service to a buyer. We are specifically requiring that the discount 
  be itemized and appear clearly on the invoice or statement. This discount may 
  take the form of a direct and explicit reduction in price, or of an indirect 
  reduction that results from the offer of an extra quantity of the item purchased 
  "at no extra charge." This exemption specifically does not apply to remuneration 
  in the form of other things of value, such as rebates of cash, other free goods 
  or services, redeemable coupons, or credit towards the future purchases of other 
  goods or services. It also does not apply to any reductions in price offered 
  to beneficiaries, such as routine reductions or waiver of coinsurance and deductible 
  amounts owed by program beneficiaries, unless permitted under these regulations 
  for inpatient hospital care. 
<p>We have proposed to limit the scope of this exemption because we have become 
  aware of numerous practices whereby practitioners and providers have been offered 
  a variety of things of value, which are not legitimate "discounts," in return 
  for referrals of Medicare or State health care program business. Such forms 
  of remuneration include, among other things, trips, computers or computer terminals, 
  coupons, cash rebates, or in kind offers, such as the inclusion of one free 
  item when one hundred are purchased. We believe that these practices should 
  not qualify for the discount exemption because many of them are subject to abuse 
  and because their benefits cannot be realized by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>In addition, we believe that it would not be feasible to enforce the requirements 
  of the exemption if remuneration other than price discounts were permitted here. 
  Such an enforcement effort would require the Department to know the precise 
  amount and value of these other goods or services and then be able to apportion 
  that value to each claim or request for payment. It would be very easy for providers 
  seeking to evade enforcement to conceal or undervalue some part of these goods 
  or services. However, we are interested in receiving comments on the prevalence 
  of such arrangements and mechanisms that could be used to recognize other cash 
  or inkind discounts where the benefits can be realized by the Medicare and Medicaid 
  programs. 
<p>For the purposes of qualifying for this discount exemption, we have divided 
  providers, practitioners, and suppliers into three categories, depending on 
  how they are reimbursed under the programs: (1) Payments based on reasonable 
  cost, acquisition cost, and prospectively determined payment amounts, such PPS 
  payments to hospitals, the composite rate paid to providers of maintenance renal 
  dialysis services, or payments made <em>exclusively</em> on a fee schedule; 
  (2) payments based in whole or in part on charges; and (3) payments based on 
  a capitated risk sharing basis under section 1876 of the Act or on a similar 
  basis. 
<p>With respect to the first category, cost-based or PPS paid providers, the exemption 
  merely requires the individual or entity to report the discount. Of course, 
  we expect that the <em>full</em>amount of the discount to be reported. For the 
  most part, this would be accomplished through the cost report. 
<p>For example, the reasonable cost rules at 42 CFR 413.98 specify how to report 
  discounts. In other cases, such as with payments based on acquisition costs, 
  the discount could alternatively be reported on the claim or request for payment. 
<p><strong></strong>With respect to the second category, those paid in whole or 
  in part on the basis of charges, the exemption applies only if the discount 
  is reported, and the actual charge is reduced by <em>the full amount</em> of 
  the discount. 
<p>This second discount exemption applies to all individuals or entities that 
  are reimbursed based on the lesser of actual charges or fee schedule amounts. 
  We are aware of many situations, particularly in the case of laboratory-to- 
  laboratory discounts offered by one clinical diagnostic laboratory to another, 
  where fee schedule amounts are being paid by Medicare but if the discount were 
  properly reported and fully reflected, the actual charge would be reduced to 
  below the fee schedule amount. 
<p>With respect to the third category, we are proposing not to impose any requirements 
  or risk sharing health maintenance organizations or competitive medical plans 
  paid on a capitated basis under section 1876 of the Act or on a similar basis. 
  Since we do not perceive any circumstance where the Medicare or State health 
  care programs will benefit from any price reductions obtained by these entities, 
  we see no purpose in imposing any requirements on them to comply with this exemption. 
<p>2. Employees. 
<p>This statutory exemption permits an employer to pay an employee in whatever 
  manner he or she chooses for having that employee assist in the solicitation 
  of Medicare or State health care program business. The proposed exemption follows 
  the statute in that it applies only to bona fide employee-employer relationships. 
  We have decided to adopt the definition of employee from the Internal Revenue 
  Service set forth in 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2). 
<p>In response to the October 21, 1987 request for comments, many commenters suggested 
  that we broaden the exemption to apply to independent contractors paid on a 
  commission basis. We have declined to adopt this approach because we are aware 
  of many examples of abusive practices by sales personnel who are paid as independent 
  contractors and who are not under appropriate supervision. We believe that if 
  individuals and entities desire to pay a salesperson on the basis of the amount 
  of business they generate, then to be exempt from civil or criminal prosecution, 
  they should make these salespersons employees where they can and should exert 
  appropriate supervision for the individual's acts. 
<p>3. Group purchasing organizations. 
<p>This exemption applies to payments made by a vendor of goods or services to 
  a person authorized to act as a group purchasing organization (GPO) for a number 
  of individuals or entities who are furnishing Medicare or State health care 
  program services. The exemption closely follows the statute, and requires a 
  written agreement between the GPO and the individual or entity that specifies 
  the amount the GPO will be paid. Where the entity is a provider, the exemption 
  requires the GPO to disclose in writing to the provider at least annually the 
  amounts received from each vendor with respect to purchases made on behalf of 
  that provider. Providers must make such disclosures available to the Department 
  upon request, but we are not proposing at this time to require that these disclosures 
  be submitted on a routine basis. In addition, we are not proposing more specific 
  requirements as to the content of the disclosure. At this time, we have concluded 
  that the purposes of this statutory exemption are fulfilled with these limited 
  disclosure requirements. Of course, providers and GPOs remain free to supplement 
  these requirements as they see fit. 
<p>III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<p>A. Introduction 
<p>Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initial regulatory 
  impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one of the Executive 
  Order criteria for a "major rule," that is, that would be likely to result in 
  (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase 
  in costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, State, or 
  local government agencies or geographic regions; or, (3) significant adverse 
  effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or 
  on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based 
  enterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare 
  a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility 
  Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 6712), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed 
  regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
  of small entities. 
<p>B. Impact on Providers and Practitioners 
<p>The provision providing new authority to the OIG to exclude a person or entity 
  from Medicare and State health care programs if engaged in a prohibited remuneration 
  scheme would ensure that the Department could seek action against those practicing 
  in such prohibited schemes short of criminal prosecution. This provision, is 
  a result of the statute and not this proposed rule. In addition, this proposed 
  rule attempts to specify various business and payment practices that would not 
  be considered a kickback for purposes of criminal or civil remedies. The regulations 
  serve to clarify departmental policy as to the legality of various commercial 
  arrangements. We believe that the great majority of providers and practitioners 
  do not engage in illegal remuneration schemes, and that the aggregate economic 
  impact of this provision should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those 
  who have chosen to interpret the kickback statute broadly and who have engaged 
  in prohibited payment schemes in violation of the statutory intent. 
<p>C. Conclusion 
<p>For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysis is 
  not required. Further we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
  this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a number 
  of small business entities. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility 
  analysis. 
<p>IV. Paperwork Reduction Act <br>
  <br>
<p>Section 1001.952 of this proposed rule contains information collection requirements. 
  As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504), we have 
  submitted a copy of this proposed rule to the Executive Office of Management 
  and Budget (EOMB) for its review of these requirements. Other organizations 
  and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements 
  should follow the instructions in the ADDRESS section of this preamble. 
<p>V. Response to Comments 
<p>Because of the large number of comments we normally receive on proposed regulations, 
  we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparing 
  the final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and respond to 
  the major issues in the preamble to that rule. 
<p>List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 1001 
<p>Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Health facilities, Health professions, 
  Medicare. 
<p>42 CFR Chapter V, Part 1001 would be amended as set forth below: 
<p><strong></strong>PART 1001--PROGRAM INTEGRITY: MEDICARE 
<p>1. The authority citation for Part 1001 would be revised to read as follows: 
<p>Authority: Secs. 1102, 1128, 1128B, 1842(j), 1842(k), 1862(d), 1862(e), 1866(b)(2) 
  (D), (E), and (F), and 1871 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1320a-7, 
  1320a-7b, 1395u(j), 1395u(k), 1395y(d), 1395y(e), 1395cc(b)(2) (D), (E), and 
  (F), and 1395hh), unless otherwise noted. 
<p>2. A new Subpart E is added to Part 1001 to read as follows: 
<p>Subpart E--Permissive Exclusions 
<p>Sec. 1001.951 Fraud, kickbacks and other prohibited activities. 
<p>1001.952 Exceptions. 
<p>Subpart E--Permissive Exclusions 
<p>&#167; 1001.951 Fraud, kickbacks and other prohibited activities. 
<p>The OIG may exclude any individual or entity that it determines has committed 
  an act described in section 1128B of the Social Security Act, subject to the 
  exceptions set forth in &#167; 1001.952. 
<p>&#167; 1001.952 Exceptions. 
<p>The following payment practices shall not be treated as a criminal offense 
  under section 1128B of the Act and shall not serve as the basis for an exclusion. 
<p>(a) Investment interests. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include any payment that is a return, such as a dividend, capital gains 
  distribution, or interest income, from an investment obtained for fair market 
  value in the investment securities (including shares in a corporation, bonds, 
  debentures, notes, or other debt instruments) of a corporation that, at the 
  end of the corporation's fiscal year preceding the purchase of the securities, 
  had-- 
<p>(1) Total assets exceeding $5,000,000, and 
<p>(2) A class of equity security held of record by at least 500 persons. 
<p>(b) Space rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not including payments made by a lessee to a lessor for the use of premises, 
  as long as-- 
<p>(1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties; 
<p>(2) The lease specifies the premises covered by the lease; <br>
  <br>
<p>(3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with access to the premises 
  for periodic intervals of time, rather than on a full-time basis for the term 
  of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals their 
  precise length, their periodicity, and the exact rent for such intervals; 
<p>(4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year; and 
<p>(5) The rental charge is consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions 
  and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value 
  of any referrals of business between the parties reimbursed under Medicare or 
  Medicaid. 
<p>For purposes of this section, the term "fair market value" means the value 
  of the rental property for general commercial purposes (not taking account of 
  its intended use), but shall not be adjusted to reflect the additional value 
  the prospective lessee or lessor would attribute to the property as a result 
  of its proximity or convenience to the lessor where the lessor is a potential 
  source of patient referrals to the lessee. 
<p>(c) Equipment rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not include payments made by a lessee of equipment to the owner ("lessor") of 
  the equipment for the use of the equipment, as long as-- 
<p>(1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties; 
<p>(2) The lease specifies the equipment covered by the lease; 
<p>(3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with use of the equipment 
  for periodic intervals of time rather than on a full-time basis for the term 
  of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their 
  precise length, their periodicity, and the exact rent for such intervals; 
<p>(4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year; and 
<p>(5) The rental charge is consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions 
  and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value 
  of any referrals of business between the parties reimbursed under Medicare or 
  Medicaid. 
<p>For purposes of this section, the term "fair market value" means the value 
  of the equipment when obtained from a manufacturer or professional distributor, 
  but shall not be adjusted to reflect the additional value the prospective lessee 
  or lessor would attribute to the equipment as a result of its proximity or convenience 
  to the lessor where the lessor is a potential source of patient referrals to 
  the lessee. 
<p>(d) Personal services and management contracts. As used in section 1128B of 
  the Act, "remuneration" does not include payments made by a principal to an 
  agent as compensation for the services of the agent, as long as-- 
<p>(1) The agency agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties; 
<p>(2) The agency agreement specifies the services to be provided by the agent; 
<p>(3) If the agency agreement is intended to provide for the services of the 
  agent on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time 
  basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement specifies exactly the schedule 
  of such intervals, their precise length, their periodicity, and the exact charge 
  for such intervals; 
<p>(4) The term of the agreement is for not less than one year; and 
<p>(5) The aggregate compensation paid to the agent over the term of the agreement 
  is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in arms- length transactions 
  and is not determined in a manner than takes into account the volume or value 
  of any referrals of business between the parties that is reimbursed under Medicare 
  or any State health care program. <br>
  <br>
<p>For purposes of this section, an agent of a principal is any person, other 
  than a bona fide employee, who has an agreement to perform services for, or 
  on behalf of, the principal. 
<p>(e) Sale of practice. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not include payments made to a practitioner by another practitioner where one 
  practitioner is selling his or her practice to another practitioner, as long 
  as-- 
<p>(1) The period from the date of any agreement pertaining to the sale to the 
  completion of the sale is not more than one year; and 
<p>(2) The practitioner who is selling his or her practice will not be in a professional 
  position to make referrals to the purchasing practitioner after one year from 
  the date of the agreement. 
<p>(f) Referral services. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include payments by a physician to an entity which offers to the public 
  that it will refer a person to a physician for medical services, as long as-- 
<p>(1) The entity does not exclude any qualified physician from participation 
  in the referral service; 
<p>(2) Any fee for participation in the referral service is charged equally to 
  all physicians and is reasonably related to the cost of operating the referral 
  service; 
<p>(3) The entity imposes no requirements on the manner in which the physician 
  provides services to a referred person, except that the entity may require that 
  these services be furnished free of charge or at reduced charge to the patient; 
  and 
<p>(4) The entity makes a disclosure to each person referred as to-- 
<p>(i) The manner in which it selects a physician for the person, 
<p>(ii) The nature of the relationship between the entity and the physicians to 
  whom it makes referrals, and 
<p>(iii) The nature of any restrictions that would exclude a physician from the 
  pool of physicians to whom referrals are made. 
<p>(g) Warranties. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not 
  include payments by a manufacturer or supplier of an item to the purchaser of 
  the item as compensation for any loss sustained by the purchaser due to the 
  failure of the item to operate as intended, as long as the payment-- 
<p>(1) Is made in accordance with a written affirmation made in connection with 
  the original sale of the item by the supplier to the purchaser, with such affirmation 
  relating to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirming or promising 
  that such material or workmanship is defect-free or will meet a specified level 
  of performance over a specified period of time; and, 
<p>(2) Is reasonably related to the economic loss that would otherwise be sustained 
  by the purchaser, including, but not limited to-- 
<p>(i) either a refund of the purchase price or the repair or replacement of the 
  defective item, and 
<p>(ii) reimbursement of any costs associated with replacing the product. 
<p>(h) Discounts. (1) As used in section 1128B of the Act, a discount is a reduction 
  in the amount a seller charges for a good or service to a buyer (who buys either 
  directly or through a contract with a group purchasing organization) that appears 
  on the invoice or statement. Discounts do not include rebates of cash, other 
  kinds of free goods or services, redeemable coupons, credit towards the future 
  purchase of any goods or services, routine reductions or waivers of any coinsurance 
  or deductible amount owed by program beneficiaries for other than inpatient 
  hospital services, or other remuneration in cash or in kind. 
<p>(2) A reduction in a seller's charge is considered a discount as long as an 
  individual or entity that solicits or receives such discount-- <br>
  <br>
<p>(i) On an item or service for which payment is made on the basis of a reasonable 
  cost, acquisition cost, or prospectively determined payment amounts (such as 
  prospective payments system payments to hospitals, or the composite rate paid 
  to providers of maintenance renal dialysis services), fully and accurately reports 
  the discount in the applicable cost reporting mechanism or claim for payment 
  filed with the Department, a State agency or one of their agents; 
<p>(ii) On an item or service for which payment is made in whole or in part on 
  the basis of charges-- 
<p>(A) Fully and accurately reports the discount in the applicable claim for payment 
  filed with the Department, a State agency, or one of their agents, and 
<p>(B) Reduces the charge to the program or the beneficiary by the full amount 
  of the discount; or 
<p>(iii) Is a health maintenance organization or competitive medical plan paid 
  for by Medicare as a risk contractor under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility 
  Act of 1982, as authorized under section 1876 of the Act, or by a Medicaid State 
  agency on a similar basis. 
<p>(i) Employees. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not 
  include any amount paid by an employer to an employee, who has a bona fide employment 
  relationship with the employer, for employment in the provision of covered items 
  or services. For purposes of this section, the term "employee" has the same 
  meaning as it does for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2). 
<p>(j) Group purchasing organizations. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include payments by a vendor of goods or services to a person authorized 
  to act as a purchasing agent for a group of individuals or entities who are 
  furnishing services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, as long as-- 
<p>(1) The purchasing agent has a written agreement with each individual or entity 
  in the group that specifies the amount the agent will be paid by each vendor 
  (where such amount may be a fixed sum or a fixed percentage of the value of 
  purchases made from the vendor by the members of the group under the contract 
  between the vendor and the purchasing agent); and 
<p>(2) In the case of an entity that is a provider of services, the agent discloses 
  in writing to the entity at least annually, and to the Secretary upon request, 
  the amount received from each vendor with respect to purchases made by or on 
  behalf of the entity.
