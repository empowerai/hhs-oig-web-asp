<p>[Name and address redacted] 
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your memorandum of March 27, 2000, in which you 
  asked for our views on whether an advisory opinion issued by this office requires 
  laboratories to raise their charges to meet or exceed Medicare's fee schedule. 
  Specifically, you received a question from the Regional Health Administrator 
  ("RHA"), Region VIII concerning a grantee under Title X of the Public Health 
  Service Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300 <u>et seq</u>. The grantee, which is a component 
  of the State of South Dakota, has been told by one of its laboratory contractors 
  that its charges will be increased for lab samples received on or after February 
  1, 2000. The RHA has indicated that the grantee believes other laboratories 
  will follow suit and that the rise in charges will have a significant impact 
  on the grantee's Title X program. The laboratory asserts that it must increase 
  its charges due to changes mandated under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act 
  of 1999 ("BBRA"), as well as Advisory Opinion No. 99-13 (December 7, 1999). 
<p>The laboratory arrangements you have asked about raise potential issues under 
  both the Federal health care program anti-kickback statute, section 1128B(b) 
  of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), and the exclusion authority relating 
  to charges to the Medicare or Medicaid programs that are substantially in excess 
  of a provider's or supplier's usual charges, section 1128(b)(6)(A) of the Act. 
  These generic issues were the subject of OIG Advisory Opinion 99-13. 
<p>OIG advisory opinions, special fraud alerts, and similar guidance sometimes 
  identify certain practices as "suspect" in relation to the Federal health care 
  program anti-kickback statute. We think there may be some misunderstanding in 
  the industry as to the import of this identification. These practices are not 
  <em>per se</em> violations of the anti-kickback statute; the statute is a criminal 
  statute and requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the parties had unlawful 
  intent. It is not only what the parties did, but why they did it, that is crucial 
  to a prosecution. Our guidance identifies the types of practices that we believe 
  potentially violate the statute <u>if</u> there is improper intent. Specifically, 
  our designation of a practice as "suspect" is based on our assessment that the 
  practice itself is some evidence of a violation and serves as a warning to the 
  health care industry that they participate in such activities at their own risk.	
<p>An anti-kickback statute violation is not determined by the size of the discount; 
  rather, a violation arises if the discount &#173; whatever its size &#173; is 
  implicitly or explicitly tied to referrals of Federal business. Advisory Opinion 
  99-13 specifically addressed the issue of a laboratory giving deep discounts 
  to physicians for business that the physicians pay for out of their own pockets, 
  in return for the referral of more lucrative Medicare Part B business for which 
  the laboratories receive direct reimbursement from Medicare. Our concern was 
  that the proposed conduct potentially involved purposeful discounting of private 
  pay business to induce the referral of Federal health care program business 
  &#173; prohibited conduct under the Federal anti-kickback statute. While advisory 
  opinions are only binding on the requesting parties, the same analytical framework 
  laid out in the opinion would apply to arrangements between other providers 
  and laboratories. 
<p>In order to establish a violation, there must be evidence to support a linkage 
  between the discounts and the referral of non-discounted Federal health care 
  program business. In order to determine if a discount is linked to the referral 
  of other Federal program business, such as Medicare, we would first look to 
  see if there is any Medicare business referred by the facility to the laboratory, 
  and if so, if it is substantial enough in relation to the discounted business 
  to infer a connection between the two. 
<p>Where there is evidence of a connection between the two, the size of a discount 
  may provide further indicia of intent. Accordingly, the opinion identified two 
  pricing benchmarks below which we believe discounts raise anti-kickback concerns. 
  However, discount arrangements below those benchmarks are not illegal <em>per 
  se</em>, but only "suspect" in the sense that they may merit further investigation 
  depending on the facts and circumstances presented. For example, we recognize 
  that there are reasons why a company might agree to sell services below its 
  average fully loaded costs. Notwithstanding, we think that pricing arrangements 
  that couple the referral of Medicare business that is reimbursed above the provider's 
  average fully loaded costs with charges for private business that are below 
  the provider's average fully loaded costs merit close scrutiny. 
<p>In addition, section 1128(b)(6)(A), which permits exclusion of providers that 
  submit claims to Medicare or Medicaid for amounts substantially in excess of 
  the provider's usual charges, is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to private 
  pay customers. Section 1128(b)(6)(A) addresses a much narrower issue &#173; 
  tiered pricing structures that set one price for Medicare or Medicaid and a 
  substantially lower price for most other customers. Given the statutory language, 
  we do not believe that the section 1128(b)(6)(A) is implicated unless a provider's 
  charge to Medicare is substantially in excess of its median non-Medicare/Medicaid 
  charge. In other words, a provider need not even worry about section 1128(b)(6)(A), 
  unless it is discounting close to half of its non-Medicare/Medicaid business. 
  In addition, the statute contains an explicit exception permitting a charge 
  differential where " the Secretary finds there is good cause" for the disparate 
  treatment. Within these parameters, providers are free to negotiate discounts, 
  so long as the discounts are not tied to unlawful referrals of Federal health 
  care program business. 
<p>Finally, we are not aware of any provision of the BBRA that specifically mandates 
  laboratories to raise their charges for non-Medicare business.&nbsp; We hope 
  this information is helpful.&nbsp;<br wp="br2">
