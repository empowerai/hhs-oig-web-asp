  Anti-kickback Statute Safe Harbors</strong></font></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General today 
  announced eight new final regulatory &quot;safe harbors&quot; to the federal 
  anti-kickback statute, which prohibits the knowing payment of anything of value 
  to influence referral of federal health care program business, including Medicare 
  and Medicaid. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The new safe harbors, which protect certain arrangements from prosecution under 
  the anti-kickback statute, address the following payment or business practices: 
  investments in underserved areas; practitioner recruitment in underserved areas; 
  obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies for underserved areas; sales of 
  physician practices to hospitals in underserved areas; investments in ambulatory 
  surgical centers; investments in group practices; referral arrangements for 
  specialty services; and cooperative hospital service organizations. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;These new safe harbors reflect our desire to accommodate the legitimate 
  concerns of the industry and to promote the effective and efficient delivery 
  of health care services to federal health care program beneficiaries,&quot; 
  Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said. &quot;The final regulation responds 
  to many of the concerns raised by the industry in response to our original proposals, 
  as well as our annual solicitation for new safe harbor suggestions.&quot; <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  On the books since 1972, the federal anti-kickback law prohibits anyone from 
  knowingly and willfully receiving or paying anything of value to influence the 
  referral of federal health care program business. Violations of the law are 
  punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines up to $25,000, administrative 
  civil money penalties up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in federal 
  health care programs. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;The federal anti-kickback statute is the guarantor of objective medical 
  advice for federal health care program beneficiaries and helps ensure that providers 
  refer patients based on the patients' best medical interests and not because 
  the providers stand to profit from the referral,&quot; Brown said. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Because the law is broad on its face, concerns arose among health care providers 
  that some relatively innocuous -- and in some cases even beneficial -- commercial 
  arrangements are prohibited by the anti-kickback law. Responding to these concerns, 
  Congress in 1987 authorized the Department to issue regulations designating 
  specific safe harbors for various payment and business practices that, while 
  potentially prohibited by the law, would not be prosecuted. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Office of Inspector General has previously published 13 regulatory safe 
  harbors, 11 in 1991 and two in 1992. A new final rule scheduled for publication 
  in the Nov. 19, 1999, <em>Federal Register </em>will establish eight new safe 
  harbor provisions and clarify six of the original 11 safe harbors published 
  in 1991. Additionally, an interim final rule establishing two additional safe 
  harbors for shared-risk arrangements is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 
  19, 1999, <em>Federal Register</em>. Both rules went on public display today 
  at the <em>Federal Register. </em>After the new rules are published in the <em>Federal 
  Register</em>, there will be a total of 23 regulatory safe harbors consolidated 
  in the Code of Federal Regulations in 21 subparagraphs. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The 1991 safe harbors addressed the following types of business or payment practices: 
  investments in large publicly held health care companies; investments in small 
  health care joint ventures; space rental; equipment rental; personal services 
  and management contracts; sales of retiring physicians' practices to other physicians; 
  referral services; warranties; discounts; employee compensation; group purchasing 
  organizations; and waivers of Medicare Part A inpatient cost-sharing amounts. 
  The 1992 interim final safe harbors, which were issued in final form in 1996, 
  addressed the following practices in managed care settings: increased coverage, 
  reduced cost-sharing amounts, or reduced premium amounts offered by health plans 
  to beneficiaries; and price reductions offered to health plans by providers. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The new final rule clarifies aspects of the original safe harbors for large 
  and small entity investments; space rental; equipment rental; personal services 
  and management contracts; referral services; and discounts. The intent of the 
  clarifications is to make the regulations easier for the industry to understand 
  and apply to particular factual circumstances.</p>

  harbors is available on the Office of Inspector General Web site at oig.hhs.gov.

  for Nov. 19, 1999, the rules will be available on the Office of Inspector General 
  Web site.</strong> </p>
