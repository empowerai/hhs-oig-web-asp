<p>[Name and Address redacted] 
<p>Re: Free Services Performed by Clinical Laboratories <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>This letter is in response to your letter of September 8, 1997, concerning 
  the provision of certain free services. Specifically, your letter requested 
  guidance as to whether the provision of chart review and infection control services 
  for free by clinical laboratories to 
<p>nursing homes implicates the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, 42 
  U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b). 
<p>This office has established a procedure for formally responding to requests 
  for advice concerning the anti-kickback statute for a specific arrangement that 
  either is in existence or is one in which the requester in good faith plans 
  to undertake. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
<p>&#167; 1008.15; 62 Fed. Reg. 7350, 7358. The request for such an opinion must 
  come from a party that is a participant in the arrangement. Since your request 
  does not concern a particular arrangement we cannot provide you with a formal 
  opinion. However, we can make some general observations regarding the practices 
  described. 
<p>In general, the anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly 
  and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce 
  the referral of items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or 
  in part, by a Federal health care program. In other words, the statute prohibits 
  payments made purposefully to induce referrals of business payable by a Federal 
  health care program. Violation of the anti-kickback statute is a felony punishable 
  by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. The 
  Department of Health and Human Services may also exclude persons who violate 
  the anti-kickback statute from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>The OIG has stated on numerous occasions its view that the provision of free 
  services to an actual or potential referral source can constitute prohibited 
  remuneration under the anti-kickback statute, depending on the circumstances. 
  For example, in a Special Fraud Alert concerning placement by clinical laboratories 
  of phlebotomists in physicians' offices, we observed: 
<p>"While the mere placement of a laboratory employee in the physician's office 
  would not necessarily serve as an inducement prohibited by the anti-kickback 
  statute, the statute is implicated when the phlebotomist performs additional 
  tasks that are normally the responsibility of the physician's office staff. 
  These tasks can include taking vital signs or other nursing functions, testing 
  for the physician's office laboratory, or performing clerical services." 
<p>Where the phlebotomist performs clerical or medical functions not directly 
  related to the collection or processing of laboratory specimens, a strong inference 
  arises that he or she is providing a benefit in return for the physician's referrals 
  to the laboratory. In such a case, the physician, the phlebotomist, and the 
  laboratory may have exposure under the anti-kickback statute. This analysis 
  applies equally to the placement of phlebotomists in other health care settings, 
  including nursing homes, clinics, and hospitals. 59 Fed. Reg. 242 (December 
  19, 1994). 
<p>Your letter alleges that nursing homes in many areas of the country are asking 
  clinical laboratories to provide a variety of chart review and infection control 
  services for the nursing homes free of charge. These services include: reviewing 
  doctors' orders and establishing, changing, or discontinuing "standing orders" 
  for certain tests based upon that review; determining whether doctors' orders 
  for laboratory tests have been carried out and recorded, along with the results, 
  in patients' charts; reviewing patients' drug regimens and determining whether 
  there is a need for laboratory monitoring or tests; and providing infection 
  control services, including testing and reporting areas where acceptable limits 
  are exceeded. You have indicated that Federal and/or State law requires nursing 
  homes to perform these services. 
<p>The provision of services that the recipient would otherwise be obligated to 
  provide for free or at less than fair market value confers a benefit on the 
  recipient. This benefit may constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if one purpose of the remuneration is to secure referrals of Federal 
  program business. Under the circumstances described in your letter, a strong 
  inference is that the clinical laboratories are being asked to provide the free 
  chart review and infection control services in exchange for referrals of the 
  nursing homes' laboratory business, including services payable in whole or in 
  part by a Federal program. We would view such arrangements as highly suspect. 
<p>Finally, we point out that in addition to potential criminal liability under 
  the anti-kickback statute, there is legal authority that any claim tainted by 
  a kickback arrangement is a "false or fraudulent" claim under the Federal False 
  Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3729. <u>See U.S. ex rel. Pogue v. American Healthcorp, 
  Inc.</u>, 914 F. Supp. 1507 (M.D. Tenn. 1996). Parties to such arrangements 
  risk exposure not only to the government but also to <u>qui tam</u>suits by 
  their employees and customer's employees. 
<p>If you can provide us with specific details on particular parties involved 
  in the types of activities identified in your letter and the arrangements into 
  which they have entered, we would be interested in investigating them. 
<p>Very truly yours, 
<p>/s/
