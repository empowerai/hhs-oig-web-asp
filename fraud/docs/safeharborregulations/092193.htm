<p>Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; Additional Safe Harbor Provisions Under 
<p>the OIG Anti-Kickback Statute <br>
  <br>
<p>Tuesday, September 21, 1993 (58 FR 49008) <br>
  <br>
<p>AGENCY: Office of Inspector General, HHS. 
<p>ACTION: Proposed rule. 
<p>SUMMARY: This proposed regulation is designed to set forth an expanded listing 
  of safe harbor provisions as authorized under section 14 of the Medicare and 
  Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987. This new listing of proposed 
  safe harbors delineates additional payment and business practices under Medicare 
  and State health care programs that would be protected from criminal prosecution 
  or civil sanctions under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. 
<p>DATES: To assure consideration, public comments must be mailed or delivered 
  to the address provided below by November 22, 1993. Comments are available for 
  public inspection October 5, 1993. 
<p>ADDRESSES: Address comments in writing to: Office of Inspector General, Department 
  of Health and Human Services, Attention: LRR-27-P, room 5246, 330 Independence 
  Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20201. 
<p>If you prefer, you may deliver your comments to room 5551, 330 Independence 
  Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. In commenting, please refer to file code LRR-27- 
  P. Comments will be available for public inspection in room 5551, 330 Independence 
  Avenue, SW., Washington, DC on Monday through Friday of each week from 9 a.m. 
  to 5 p.m., (202) 619-3270.

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<p>I. Background 
<p>Public Law 100-93 
<p>Section 14 of Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program 
  Protection Act of 1987, requires the promulgation of regulations specifying 
  those payment and business practices which, although potentially capable of 
  inducing referrals of business under the Medicare and State health care programs, 
  would not be treated as criminal offenses under section 1128B(b) of the Social 
  Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)) and would not serve as a basis for a program 
  exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(b)(7)). 
<p>Congress intended that the regulations setting forth various "safe harbors" 
  would be evolving rules that would be periodically updated to reflect changing 
  business practices and technologies in the health care industry. As evidenced 
  in the House Committee Report accompanying Public Law 100-93, the Committee 
  stated that it believed that periodic public input was necessary: 
<p>* * * to ensure that the regulations remain relevant in light of changes in 
  health care delivery and payment and to ensure that published interpretations 
  of the law are not impeding legitimate and beneficial activities. Accordingly, 
  the Committee expects that the Secretary will formally re-evaluate the anti- 
  kickback regulations on a periodic basis and, in doing so, will solicit public 
  comments at the outset of the review process. 
<p>Initial Proposed Rulemaking 
<p>On January 23, 1989, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth 
  various business and payment practices that we proposed to exempt from the anti-kickback 
  statute, and the rationale for their inclusion in a listing of "safe harbor" 
  provisions (54 FR 3088). The rulemaking proposed the establishment of safe harbors 
  in ten broad areas: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, personal 
  services/management contracts, sales of practice, referral services, warranties, 
  discounts, employees and group purchasing. 
<p>In response to the proposed rulemaking, we received over 750 public comments 
  that included both general and broad-reaching concerns regarding the impact 
  of these regulations. The majority of the comments received specifically addressed 
  the ten proposed safe harbors. A summary of these comments and our analysis 
  and response to those concerns are set out in the preamble to the final regulation 
  that was published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35952). In 
  addition, the public comments contained several suggestions for the consideration 
  and adoption of additional safe harbor provisions under 42 CFR 1001.952. Set 
  forth below are seven proposed new safe harbor provisions. We invite public 
  comment on these new provisions. 
<p>We wish to emphasize that nothing in this proposed regulation changes reimbursement 
  rules promulgated by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) or a State 
  health care program. If a provider chooses to engage in a particular course 
  of conduct in order to comply with these safe harbor provisions, such action 
  may very well have reimbursement implications; however, such reimbursement is 
  governed exclusively by HCFA or State regulations, and not by this rulemaking. 
<p>In addition, because this is simply a notice of proposed rulemaking, compliance 
  with either the terms of this proposed rule or standards discussed in this preamble 
  does not provide safe harbor protection at the present time. The only way to 
  protect behavior which implicates the anti-kickback statute is compliance with 
  a safe harbor provision which has been published in final form. 
<p>II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
<p>Set forth below is a description of the additional payment practices that we 
  are proposing to exempt under &#167;1001.952 of our regulations and the rationale 
  for their inclusion in this proposed rulemaking. 
<p>A. Additional Investment Interests 
<p>We are proposing three additional investment interest safe harbor provisions 
  in &#167;1001.952(a) to protect payments to investors who engage in business 
  with the entity in which they have invested. 
<p>1. Investment Interests in Rural Areas 
<p>We have been informed that many rural areas have particular problems that make 
  it difficult for them to comply with the two 60-40 rules of the "small entity" 
  investment interest safe harbor provision as currently set forth in &#167;&#167; 
  1001.952(a)(2) (i) and (vi). The first 60-40 rule, known as the "60-40 investor 
  rule," requires that no more than 40 percent of the investment interests of 
  the entity be held by investors who are in a position to make or influence referrals 
  to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity. 
  The second 60-40 rule, known as the "60-40 revenue rule," requires that no more 
  than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the entity may come from referrals or 
  business otherwise generated from investors. Rural areas have an especially<strong> 
  </strong>difficult time complying with these two standards in many cases because 
  physicians may be the only source of capital, and they may have no alternative 
  facility to which they can refer. <br>
  <br>
<p>Consequently, in a third investment interest safe harbor, &#167; 1001.952(a)(3), 
  we are proposing to eliminate these two 60-40 rules for entities serving rural 
  areas. This safe harbor would apply to entities located in rural areas as defined 
  by the Office of Management and Budget and used by the Bureau of the Census. 
  According to the 1991 Statistical Abstract of the United States, 22.5 percent 
  of the population in 1990 reside in such areas. We are soliciting comments on 
  the appropriateness of this definition of a rural area, and we will consider 
  comments on how the definition could be adapted to further the intent of this 
  proposed safe harbor. We stress, however, that the method used for designating 
  rural areas must ensure that this safe harbor only protects entities that truly 
  serve a rural population. One alternative would be to adopt the definition of 
  rural area found in 42 CFR 412.62(f)(1)(ii). 
<p>We are not proposing, however, to modify any of the other six standards in 
  the small investment interest safe harbor for rural areas that are set forth 
  in &#167;&#167; 1001.952(a)(2) (ii)-(v), (vii), and (viii). These six standards 
  provide fundamental assurances against abuse, and we have not been apprised 
  of any particular difficulty that rural entities are experiencing with these 
  other standards. Therefore, we are not requesting public comments regarding 
  the applicability of these six standards to the proposed small investment interest 
  safe harbor for rural areas. 
<p>In place of the 60-40 investor rule we are proposing a more flexible standard 
  that will still assure that referring sources, physicians in particular, are 
  not inappropriately selected as investors. We are proposing to require the entity 
  to make a bona fide offer of the investment interest to any individual or entity 
  irrespective of whether such prospective investor is in a position to make or 
  influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate 
  business for the entity. In other words, the entity may comply with this first 
  standard by offering the opportunity for investment in a good faith, nondiscriminatory 
  manner to any individuals or entities who are potential sources of capital. 
<p>Although we are eliminating the 60-40 revenue rule, we remain concerned that 
  a sham joint venture structure could be established that does not intend to 
  serve the rural area in which it is located. Consequently, we are proposing 
  to incorporate a standard that would require that at least 85 percent of the 
  dollar volume of the entity's business in the previous fiscal year or previous 
  12 month period must be derived from the service of persons who reside in a 
  rural area. In the case of an entity that has not yet been in business for 12 
  months, compliance with this standard will be determined by examining the composition 
  of the entity's business over the entire period of its existence. 
<p>2. Investment Interests in Ambulatory Surgical Centers 
<p>In a fourth investment interest safe harbor, &#167;1001.952(a)(4), we are proposing 
  to protect payments to investors in ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) who are 
  surgeons who refer patients directly to the ASC and perform surgery themselves 
  on these referred patients. 
<p>As stated in the preamble of the original set of safe harbor provisions published 
  on July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35971): 
<p>A special situation may exist when a physician sees a patient in his or her 
  office, makes a referral to an entity in which he or she has an ownership interest 
  and performs the service for which the referral is made. 
<p>This concept is often referred to as an extension of the physician's office 
  practice. In the above situation, the physician-investor receives two payments: 
  (1) the professional fee for furnishing the service, and (2) the profit distribution 
  from the entity based on the program payment the entity receives that was generated 
  from the referral. We do not consider the statute to be implicated by the first 
  payment. However, we believe that the second payment is potentially covered 
  by the statute. 
<p>As with any investment interest held by a potential referral source, the profit 
  distribution provides some financial incentive to refer patients to the entity. 
  To the extent this payment has the potential to induce physician- investors 
  to overutilize the entity, no safe harbor protection is warranted. 
<p>In contrast, where these payments do not constitute a significant inducement 
  to make referrals, they may merit safe harbor protection. Where the professional 
  fee generated by a referral is substantially greater than the facility fee generated 
  by the referral, we believe that the profit distribution payment (which results 
  from the facility fee) does not constitute a significant improper inducement. 
  Only where a great disparity between the facility and professional fees exists 
  will the incremental increase in profit distribution from a referral be so small 
  as to be inconsequential when compared to the corresponding professional fee. 
  Therefore, we will only consider providing safe harbor protection to types of 
  extensions of practice that receive facility fees from referrals that are greatly 
  disparate from the professional fee generated by the referral. 
<p>Because we believe that ASCs generally fit this criterion, we have proposed 
  a safe harbor for certain investment interests in ASCs. When a patient is referred 
  to an ASC for surgery, there is a great disparity between the surgeon's professional 
  fee and the ASC's facility fee. Therefore, we propose to protect the payment 
  of profit distributions from the ASC to investors where all investors in the 
  ASC are surgeons in a position to refer to the ASC and perform services. 
<p>This proposed safe harbor applies only to ASCs certified under 42 CFR part 
  416. We are not proposing to protect ASCs located on the premises of a hospital 
  that share their operating or recovery room space with the hospital for treatment 
  of the hospital's inpatients or outpatients. 
<p>This proposed fourth investment interest provision contains five standards. 
  The first standard precludes an investor from being afforded better investment 
  terms based on past or expected referrals or amount of services furnished to 
  the entity. The second standard requires that a passive investor not be required 
  to make referrals to the entity in order to continue as an investor. The third 
  standard prohibits the entity or any investor from loaning funds to the investor 
  for use in obtaining an investment interest. Standard four requires that payments 
  not be based on referrals. Finally, the practitioner must agree to treat Medicare 
  and Medicaid patients. 
<p>In contrast to the other investment interest safe harbors which seek to limit 
  investment by individuals in a position to refer, this proposed ASC safe harbor 
  only protects entities whose investment interests are held entirely by such 
  individuals. With that distinction in mind, four of the five proposed standards 
  have been adapted from those in the small entity safe harbor at &#167; 1001.952(a)(2). 
  We believe these standards provide fundamental assurances against abuse; however, 
  we are soliciting comments on the extent to which other standards are appropriate 
  to safeguard against potential abuse. 
<p>Further, while this proposed safe harbor only applies to ASCs certified<strong></strong> 
  under 42 CFR part 416, we are also soliciting comments on whether this rationale 
  is applicable to entities other than ASCs. Specifically, we are soliciting comments 
  on what degree of disparity should exist between the professional fees and facility 
  fees generated by referrals to a type of entity for that type of entity to receive 
  safe harbor protection. 
<p>The rationale underlying this safe harbor does not extend to investment interests 
  held by physicians who are not in a position to refer patients directly to the 
  ASC and perform surgery. Such physicians do not receive a professional fee as 
  a result of services performed by the entity. An example to illustrate the potential 
  perils of protecting profit distributions to such investors would be where a 
  non-surgeon physician investor may refer a patient to a surgeon-investor who 
  may, in turn, refer the patient to the ASC where the surgeon-investor may perform 
  the surgery. In this scenario, the non-surgeon investor would receive a return, 
  through the ASC's profit distribution, for the "indirect referral" of the patient. 
  Because of the potential for improper inducement of referrals illustrated in 
  this example, we do not think investment interests held by non-surgeon investors 
  merit safe harbor protection. 
<p>3. Investment Interests in Group Practices Composed Exclusively of Active Investors 
<p>We are considering promulgating a fifth investment interest safe harbor to 
  protect payments to investors in entities composed only of active investors 
  in a group practice. Although there may be other types of joint ventures composed 
  exclusively of active investors which should receive safe harbor protection, 
  we do not propose to protect them at this time. Rather, we are presently soliciting 
  comments on how to expand this limited safe harbor provision. 
<p>This fifth investment interest safe harbor, &#167;1001.952(a)(5), would protect 
  the investment interests of members of group practices that meet two prerequisites 
  and three standards. The two prerequisites are that all the investors must meet 
  our definition of "active investor," and all the investors must be physician 
  members of a "group practice." 
<p>We propose to adopt the definition of group practice contained in section 1877(h)(4) 
  of the Act (as added by section 6204(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
  Act of 1989, Public Law 101-239), which restricts physicians from making referrals 
  for clinical laboratory services to entities with which they have an ownership 
  interest or other compensation arrangement. This definition requires (a) physician 
  members of the group to provide substantially the full range of their services 
  through the shared use of office space, facilities, equipment and personnel; 
  (b) substantially all of the services of the members to be provided through 
  the group, billed through the group, with payments received as receipts of the 
  group; and (c) overhead expenses and income of the group to be distributed in 
  accordance with a predetermined formula. We intend principally to protect investors 
  who are individuals who qualify as "physicians" under this definition. However, 
  because our definition of investor includes entities as well as individuals, 
  our definition of group practice permits physicians to invest as a professional 
  corporation, but only to the extent that the corporation is exclusively owned 
  by the physicians. We are soliciting comments on the appropriateness of using 
  this definition of "group practice" for the purposes of this safe harbor provision. 
  One alternative would be to adopt the definition contained in the regulations 
  implementing section 1877(h)(4) of the Act when that regulation is published 
  in final form (see 57 FR 8588, March 11, 1992). Another alternative would be 
  to use the definition currently set forth in 42 CFR 417.100. 
<p>The three standards in this safe harbor are derived directly from the second 
  investment interest safe harbor in &#167;1001.952(a)(2). First, we are requiring 
  that the terms of the investment interest not be preferentially given to certain 
  physicians in the group practice based on their expected referrals. Second, 
  the entity or another investor cannot loan or guarantee a loan to the investors 
  to be used to obtain the investment interest. And third, the amount of return 
  must be directly proportional to the capital invested. We are specifically inviting 
  comments on the appropriateness of applying these standards to group practices. 
  In particular, we are soliciting information in the types of compensation arrangements 
  that exist within group practices, and the extent to which they create inappropriate 
  incentives that distort the professional judgment of the members of the group. 
<p>We recognize that there may be other non-abusive joint ventures consisting 
  exclusively of active investors. Typically, such entities are partnerships consisting 
  of general partner investors. The general partners are involved in the day-to-day 
  operation of the entity, and undertake personal liability. However, entities 
  structured in this manner can have a variety of different characteristics. For 
  example, as discussed above, the entity can be a physicians group practice where 
  all the physicians are general partners, or the entity can be a joint venture 
  between two other entities, such as a hospital and durable medical equipment 
  (DME) supplier or a DME manufacturer and a DME distributor. In addition, the 
  entity may be a subchapter S corporation instead of a partnership. 
<p>In view of the wide variety of types of entities that may warrant protection, 
  and the varying degree of safeguards that may be warranted for different types, 
  we are soliciting comments on whether we should protect other types of joint 
  ventures composed exclusively of active investors, and the extent to which we 
  should adopt the standards we have included in the second investment interest 
  safe harbor (&#167;1001.952(a)(2)). Among the areas about which we are specifically 
  soliciting comments are the varying degree of safeguards that are needed when 
  the general partners are entities as opposed to individuals, the extent to which 
  such a provision should apply in the context of a subchapter S corporation or 
  other business structure, and the extent to which protection should be afforded 
  to these entities when they have passive investors who are not in a position 
  to make referrals. 
<p>B. Practitioner Recruitment 
<p>We are proposing a safe harbor provision for certain payments or benefits offered 
  by rural hospitals and entities in their efforts to recruit physicians and other 
  practitioners to join their staffs. It has come to our attention that hospitals 
  located in rural areas have been encountering problems in helping to attract 
  physicians needed by the community. With this proposed safe harbor we hope to 
  address this problem without protecting arrangements designed to channel Medicare 
  and Medicaid business to recruiting hospitals. We have proposed to limit the 
  safe harbor to hospitals and other entities located in "rural areas" as that 
  term is defined in the proposed investment interest safe harbor for entities 
  located in rural areas. We are soliciting comments on alternative geographic 
  criteria for protecting recruitment of physicians under this safe harbor. One 
  example may be limiting the safe harbor to recruitment of practitioners by hospitals 
  and entities located in areas which are health professional shortage areas for 
  the practitioner's specialty category. 
<p>We are proposing to protect recruitment activities aimed at only two<strong></strong> 
  types of health care providers: (1) A practitioner who will need to relocate 
  to a new geographic area and start a new practice, or (2) a new practitioner 
  to assist him or her in starting a practice or specialty after completing an 
  internship or residency program. Not covered within this safe harbor are arrangements 
  between hospitals and physicians that are, in reality, payments to obtain the 
  referrals of established practitioners who work at least in part at another 
  hospital in the same area. 
<p>For the recruitment activity to be protected, we propose seven standards: (1) 
  the arrangement and its terms must be in writing; (2) if a practitioner is leaving 
  an established practice, the physical location of the new primary place of practice 
  must be not less than 100 miles from the location of the established primary 
  place of practice and at least 85 percent of the revenue of the new practice 
  must be generated from new patients not previously seen by the practitioner 
  at his or her former practice; (3) unless the practitioner's new primary place 
  of practice is designated as a health professional shortage area (HPSA) for 
  the practitioner's HPSA specialty category during the entire duration of the 
  payments or benefits, the duration of the payments or benefits cannot exceed 
  3 years; (4) the entity providing the benefits cannot condition the agreement 
  on the practitioner's referral of business to the entity; (5) the practitioner 
  cannot be restricted from establishing staff privileges at another entity or 
  referring business to another entity; (6) the entity cannot vary, adjust or 
  renegotiate the amount or value of benefits based on the volume of business 
  the practitioner generates for the entity; and (7) the practitioner must treat 
  medicare and medicaid patients. 
<p>Hospitals would not fall within this safe harbor if they use recruitment efforts 
  as a means of offering compensation to physicians as inducements for referrals. 
  Thus, we do not propose to protect subsidy payments beyond the 3- year period. 
  However, after three years, hospitals may still engage in financial relationships 
  with these physicians that qualify under other safe harbor provisions, such 
  as space rental, personal services/management contracts, or the safe harbor 
  proposed below on malpractice insurance. 
<p>The one exception to the 3-year limit on payments or benefits would be where 
  the practitioner has been recruited to a HPSA. The designated shortage would 
  have to be in the practitioner's HPSA specialty category. In addition, in order 
  to be exempted from the 3-year limit, the area would have to be designated a 
  HPSA during the duration of the relationship between the entity and the practitioner. 
<p>We are also soliciting comments on how to protect payments designed to retain 
  physicians already practicing in an area that has been designated a HPSA for 
  the physician's specialty category. <br>
  <br>
<p>C. Obstetrical Malpractice Insurance Subsidies 
<p>We are proposing a new safe harbor provision that would permit a hospital or 
  other entity to pay all or part of the malpractice insurance premiums for practitioners 
  engaging in obstetrical practice in primary care health professional shortage 
  areas. For the purposes of this provision, "practitioner" includes a "certified 
  nurse-midwife" as defined in section 1861(gg) of the Act. Seven standards would 
  need to be met. The first five standards are adopted from concepts in the rural 
  investment interest and practitioner recruitment safe harbor provisions proposed 
  above. These standards require that: (1) the agreement must be set forth in 
  writing; (2) at least 85 percent of the practitioner's obstetrical patients 
  treated under the coverage of the malpractice insurance reside in the shortage 
  area or be a part of a designated shortage area population; (3) there is no 
  requirement that the practitioner refer any level of patients to the entity; 
  (4) there is no restriction placed on the practitioner from establishing staff 
  privileges at, referring patients to, or otherwise generating business for other 
  entities; and (5) the amount of the payment may not vary based on referrals 
  made by the practitioner to the entity. 
<p>Two additional standards are also being proposed. The sixth standard attempts 
  to assure access to Medicaid patients seeking obstetrical care by requiring 
  the practitioner, as a condition of safe harbor protection, to treat such patients. 
  Finally, the seventh standard requires bona fide insurance policies to assure 
  that this provision is not used as a mechanism to disguise improper inducements 
  to physicians or other practitioners. Such insurance policies are regulated 
  under State law and are exempt from antitrust and Federal Trade Commission enforcement 
  in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1012. 
<p>Under this proposed safe harbor provision, entities would be permitted to limit 
  the coverage of the malpractice insurance to services performed at that entity. 
  Although we are concerned that such restrictive policies have the effect of 
  limiting a practitioner's professional mobility, we recognize that there are 
  important reasons for such restrictions. Often a hospital's malpractice policy 
  is limited to insure against misconduct on its premises. Although a hospital 
  can provide reasonable assurances to its underwriter that it is overseeing the 
  conduct of its medical staff, it has little ability to make any assurances of 
  the conduct of its staff when they are working at other hospitals. Thus, the 
  underwriter could be engaging in a much higher risk, and therefore might legitimately 
  charge a much higher premium, if it were to provide insurance for the hospital's 
  medical staff when it furnishes services off-site. Finally, we believe that 
  any potential for influencing the practitioner's choice of where to practice 
  that may result from this standard is mitigated by other standards within this 
  proposed provision that limit the ability of the entity to use malpractice subsidies 
  to control the stream of referrals from that practitioner. 
<p>As we noted above, nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as authorizing 
  Medicare payment to hospitals or other institutional providers for the cost 
  they may incur for such malpractice insurance. Any allowable costs for such 
  insurance is governed strictly by Medicare and Medicaid rules. 
<p>We recognize the narrowness of this safe harbor provision, which is limited 
  to malpractice subsidies for obstetrical care in HPSAs. Although the malpractice 
  problem affects many more practitioners than those we are proposing to protect 
  here, we remain concerned that such subsidies may lead to inappropriate incentives 
  and loyalties created by such incentives. However, we are soliciting comments 
  on specific, narrowly drawn circumstances where this safe harbor provision could 
  be expanded to help assure beneficiary access to services that may be significantly 
  affected by the cost of malpractice insurance premiums. In addition, we are 
  soliciting views regarding the feasibility of expanding this provision to protect 
  malpractice insurance programs that are not regulated under State law, but which 
  are operated directly by providers. 
<p>D. Referral Agreements for Specialty Services 
<p>We are proposing to protect arrangements under which an individual or entity 
  agrees to refer a patient to another individual or entity for specialty services 
  in return for an agreement on the part of the party receiving the referral to 
  refer that patient back at a certain time or under certain circumstances. For 
  example, a primary care physician and a specialist may<strong></strong> agree 
  that, when their patient reaches a particular stage of recovery, the primary 
  care physician should resume treatment of the patient. 
<p>The first standard we are proposing clarifies what is meant by specialty services; 
  that is, the service for which the referral is made may not be within the medical 
  expertise of the referring individual or entity, but is within the special expertise 
  of the other party receiving the referral. The second standard we are proposing 
  prohibits any actual payment to be made between the parties for the referral. 
  The third standard requires that the only exchange of value between the parties, 
  with one exception to be discussed below, is the opportunity to obtain monetary 
  remuneration directly from third-party payors or the patient, as compensation 
  for his or her respective professional services. As the United States Court 
  of Appeals for the First Circuit has recognized: "Giving a person an opportunity 
  to earn money may well be an inducement to that person to channel potential 
  Medicare payments toward a particular recipient." <em>United States v. Bay State 
  Ambulance </em><em>and Hospital Rental Service, Inc</em>., 874 F.2d 20, 29 (1st 
  Cir. 1989). Since the opportunity to generate a fee may constitute the requisite 
  remuneration under the statute, generally speaking, we believe that the statute 
  is implicated in many of these agreements. However, we also believe that these 
  relationships benefit patients by assuring proper continuity of care or convenient 
  access to a specialist in whom the primary care physician has confidence. 
<p>The one exception where we are proposing to permit remuneration between the 
  parties is where both parties belong to the same group practice. Obviously in 
  such situations revenues are shared between members of the group practice, and 
  thus it appears that the referring physician receives remuneration for the referral. 
  However, such financial benefits are an inherent part of belonging to a group 
  practice, and therefore we are proposing to protect such remuneration. 
<p>As discussed in sections II.A.2. and B. above, we are concerned about potentially 
  abusive combinations of physicians that are a "group practice" in name only. 
  Consequently, we are proposing to use the same definition of group practice 
  as we are proposing for the fourth investment interest safe harbor. This definition 
  is the same definition of "group practice" as is contained in section 1877(h)(4) 
  of the Act, as added by section 6204(a) of Public Law 101- 239. 
<p>E. Cooperative Hospital Service Organizations 
<p>We are proposing to provide a new safe harbor provision for most cooperative 
  hospital service organizations (CHSOs) that qualify under section 501(c)(3) 
  of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this statute and the implementing regulation 
  (26 CFR 1.501(e)-1)), these organizations are formed by two or more tax exempt 
  hospitals (known as "patron-hospitals") to provide specifically enumerated services, 
  such as purchasing, billing, and clinical services solely for the benefit of 
  its patron-hospitals. In addition, these entities are required to distribute 
  "all net earnings to patrons on the basis of services performed" (26 U.S.C. 
  501(e)(2)). 
<p>Where a health care provider engages in an activity which is specifically required 
  by another statutory provision and the provider is afforded no discretion in 
  the manner of compliance, such a requirement is a valid defense to an alleged 
  violation of the anti-kickback statute. However, where the health care provider 
  is engaging in the activity to fulfill a general statutory obligation, but is 
  afforded discretion in the manner of compliance, such a defense is not available 
  because the provider's choice in the method of compliance may be motivated by 
  an intent to generate program-related business. With respect to the payments 
  the CHSO makes to its patron-hospitals, we believe that the level of discretion 
  given to these providers as to what payment formula to use warrants safe harbor 
  protection. However, we specifically invite comments regarding the various types 
  of payment formula (which comply with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules) 
  that are used, but some of which may be more abusive than others. 
<p>This proposed provision would protect payments from a patron-hospital to a 
  CHSO to support the CHSO's operational costs and those payments from a CHSO 
  to a patron-hospital that are required under IRS rules. This proposed provision 
  requires as a condition of protection that the CHSO must be wholly owned by 
  its patron-hospitals. Such a condition protects against potentially abusive 
  joint venture arrangements that are formed under the guise of CHSOs. 
<p>To the extent a CHSO acts as a group purchasing organization or a patron-hospital 
  obtains discounts as a result of the CHSO's activities, CHSOs and patron-hospitals 
  must comply with the respective safe harbor provisions applicable to group purchasing 
  organizations and discounts to be fully protected. 
<p>We are soliciting comments on the extent to which we should expand this provision 
  to protect other similar entities specifically organized and protected under 
  Federal or State laws. 
<p>III. Solicitation of Comments for Modifying the Sale of Practice Safe Harbor 
<p>In addition to the proposed provisions discussed above, we are soliciting comments 
  on the desirability of modifying the existing sale of practice safe harbor set 
  forth in &#167;1001.952(e) to accommodate transactions involving the rural hospital 
  purchase of practice as part of a practitioner recruitment program. 
<p>The sale of practice safe harbor set forth in &#167;1001.952(e) does not protect 
  a hospital purchasing the practice of a retiring physician. We have been informed 
  that many rural hospitals, as part of their efforts to recruit practitioners, 
  buy and "hold" the practice of a retiring physician, often using locum tenens 
  physicians until a new physician can be recruited to replace the retiring one. 
  We are soliciting comments on the desirability of modifying the existing sale 
  of practice safe harbor to permit such a practice where the recruitment program 
  complies with any safe harbor we establish to protect practitioner recruitment. 
<p>IV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<p>Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initial regulatory 
  impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one of the Executive 
  Order criteria for a "major rule," that is, that would be likely to result in 
  (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase 
  in costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, State, or 
  local government agencies or geographic areas; or (3) significant adverse effects 
  on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the 
  ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises 
  in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory 
  flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
  (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation 
  would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
  entities. 
<p>For the reasons set forth in the final rule published on July 29, 1991 (56 
  FR 35952), we have determined that a<strong></strong> regulatory impact analysis 
  is not required. Further we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
  this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a number 
  of small business entities. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility 
  analysis. 
<p>V. Additional Information 
<p>Response to Comments 
<p>Because of the large number of comments we normally receive on proposed regulations, 
  we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparing 
  the final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and respond to 
  the major issues in the preamble of that rule.

  entities: 
<p>(1) If, within the previous fiscal year or previous 12 month period, the entity 
  possesses more than $50,000,000 in undepreciated net tangible assets (based

<p>(3) If the entity possesses investment interests that are held by either active 
  or passive investors and is located in a rural area, all of the following eight 
  standards must be met-- 
<p>(i) The entity must offer equal and bona fide opportunities to acquire investment

<p>(ii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to a passive investor, 
  if any, who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items

<p>(iii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an investor who 
  is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services

  amount of business otherwise generated from that investor to the entity. 
<p>(iv) There is no requirement that a passive investor, if any, make referrals 
  to, be in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services 
  to, or otherwise generate business for the entity as a condition for remaining 
  as an investor. 
<p>(v) The entity or any investor must not market or furnish the entity's items 
  or services (or those of another entity as part of a cross referral agreement) 
  to passive investors differently than to non-investors. 
<p>(vi) At least 85 percent of the dollar volume of the entity's business in the

  items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity if the investor 
  uses any part of such loan to obtain the investment interest. 
<p>(viii) The amount of payment to an investor in return for the investment interest 
  must be directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment (including 
  the fair market value of any pre-operational services rendered) of that investor. 
<p>(4) If the entity is a certified ambulatory surgical center (ASC) under part 
  416 of this title, whose operating and recovery room space is dedicated exclusively 
  to the ASC (and not a part of a hospital), and all of the investors are surgeons 
  who are in a position to refer patients directly to the entity and perform surgery 
  on such referred patients, all of the following five standards must be met-- 
<p>(i) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an investor must 
  not be related to the previous or expected volume of referrals, services furnished, 
  or the amount of business otherwise generated from that investor to the entity. 
<p>(ii) There is no requirement that a passive investor, if any, make referrals 
  to the entity as a condition for remaining as an investor.

  all of the following three standards must be met-- 
<p>(i) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to the investor must 
  not be related to the previous or expected volume or referrals of business, 
  items or services furnished, or the amount of business otherwise generated from 
  that investor to the entity. 
<p>(ii) The entity or any investor must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan 
  for<strong></strong> the investor if the investor uses any part of such loan 
  to obtain the investment interest. 
<p>(iii) The amount of payment to the investor in return for the investment interest 
  must be directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment (including 
  the fair market value of any pre-operational services rendered) of that investor. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following terms apply. Active 
  investor means an investor either who is responsible for the day-to-day management 
  of the entity and is a bona fide general partner in a partnership under the 
  Uniform Partnership Act or who agrees in writing to undertake liability for 
  the actions of the entity's agents acting within the scope of their agency. 
  Group practice means a group of two or more physicians that meets the definition 
  of group practice under section 1877(h)(4) of the Act. Investment interest means

  hold such investment interest or holding a legal or beneficial interest in another 
  entity (such as a trust or holding company) that holds such investment interest. 
  Passive investor means an investor who is not an active investor, such as a 
  limited partner in a partnership under the Uniform Partnership Act, a shareholder 
  in a corporation, or a holder of a debt security. Rural area means any defined 
  geographic area that is not a metropolitan area as defined by the Office of 
  Management and Budget. 
<p>* * * 
<p>(n) Practitioner recruitment. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include any payment or exchange of anything of value by an entity located 
  in rural areas (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) in order to induce 
  a practitioner who has been practicing within his or her current specialty for 
  less than one year to establish staff privileges at the entity, or to induce 
  any other practitioner to relocate his or her primary place of practice to the 
  geographic area served by the entity, as long as all of the following seven 
  standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The arrangement is set forth in a written agreement that specifies the 
  benefits provided by the entity, the terms under which the benefits are to be 
  provided, and the obligations of each party. 
<p>(2) If a practitioner is leaving an established practice, the physical location 
  of the new primary place of practice must be not less than 100 miles from the 
  location of the established primary place of practice and at least 85 percent 
  of the revenues of the new practices must be generated from new patients not 
  previously seen by the practitioner at his or her former practice. 
<p>(3) The benefits are provided by the entity for a period not in excess of 3 
  years, and the terms of the agreement are not renegotiated during this 3 year 
  period in any substantial aspect, unless the practitioner's new primary place 
  of practice is designated as a health professional shortage area (HPSA) for 
  the practitioner's specialty category during the entire duration of the relationship 
  between the practitioner and the entity. 
<p>(4) There is no requirement that the practitioner make referrals to, be in 
  a position to make or influence referrals to, or otherwise generate business 
  for the entity as a condition for receiving the benefits. 
<p>(5) The practitioner is not restricted from establishing staff privileges at, 
  referring any service to, or otherwise generating any business for any other 
  entity of his or her choosing. 
<p>(6) The amount or value of the benefits provided by the entity may not vary 
  (or be adjusted or renegotiated) in any manner based on the volume or value 
  of any expected referrals to or business otherwise generated for the entity 
  by the practitioner for which payment may be made in whole or in part under 
  Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>(7) The practitioner agrees to treat patients receiving medical benefits or 
  assistance under title XVIII or XIX of the Act. 
<p>(o) Obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies. As used in section 1128B of 
  the Act, "remuneration" does not include any payment made by a hospital or other 
  entity to another entity that is providing malpractice insurance regulated by 
  State law, where such payment is used to pay for some or all of the costs of 
  malpractice insurance premiums for a practitioner who engages in obstetrical 
  practice (including a certified nurse-midwife as defined in section 1861(gg) 
  of the Act) in primary care HPSAs, as long as all of the following eight standards 
  are met-- 
<p>(1) The payment is made in accordance with a written agreement between the 
  entity paying the premiums and the practitioner, which sets out the payments 
  to be made by the entity, and the terms under which the payments are to be provided. 
<p>(2) At least 85 percent of the practitioner's obstetrical patients treated 
  under the coverage of the malpractice insurance must either-- 
<p>(i) Reside in an area designated by the Secretary under part 5 of this title 
  as having a shortage of primary medical care manpower, or 
<p>(ii) Be part of a population group designated by the Secretary under part 5 
  of this title as having a shortage of primary medical care manpower. 
<p>(3) There is no requirement that the practitioner make referrals to, be in 
  a position to make or influence referrals to, or otherwise generate business 
  for the entity as a condition for receiving the benefits. 
<p>(4) The practitioner is not restricted from establishing staff privileges at, 
  referring any service to, or otherwise generating any business for any other 
  entity of his or her choosing. 
<p>(5) The amount of payment may not vary based on the volume or value of any 
  previous or expected referrals to or business otherwise generated for the entity 
  by the practitioner for which payment may be made in whole or in part under 
  Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>(6) The practitioner agrees to treat obstetrical patients who receive medical 
  assistance under title XIX of the Act. 
<p>(7) The insurance premium is calculated based on a bona fide assessment of 
  the liability risk covered under the insurance policy. 
<p>(p) Referral agreements for specialty services. As used in section 1128B of 
  the Act, "remuneration" does not include any exchange of value among individuals 
  and entities where one party agrees to refer a patient to the other party for 
  the provision of a specialty service payable in whole or in part under Medicare 
  or a State health care program in return for an agreement on the part of the 
  other party to refer that patient back at a mutually agreed upon time or circumstance 
  as long as the following three standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The service for which the referral is made is not within the medical expertise 
  of the referring individual or entity, but is within the special expertise of 
  the other party receiving the referral. 
<p>(2) The parties receive no payment from each other for the referral. 
<p>(3) Unless both parties belong to the same group practice as defined in paragraph 
  (a) of this section, the only exchange of value between the parties is<strong> 
  </strong>the remuneration the parties receive directly from third-party payors 
  or the patient compensating the parties for the services they each have furnished 
  to the patient. 
<p>(q) Cooperative hospital service organizations. As used in section 1128B of 
  the Act, "remuneration" does not include any payment made between a cooperative 
  hospital service organization (CHSO) and its patron-hospital, both of which 
  are described in section 501(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and are 
  tax- exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, where the 
  CHSO is wholly owned by two or more patron-hospitals, as long as all of the 
  standards are met within either of the following two categories of payments-- 
<p>(1) If the patron-hospital makes a payment to the CHSO, it must be for the 
  purpose of paying for the bona fide operating expenses of the CHSO. 
<p>(2) If the CHSO makes a payment to the patron-hospital, it must be for the 
  purpose of paying a distribution of net earnings required to be made under section 
  501(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br>
