<p>Re: Free Prostate Biopsy Needles <br wp="br1">

<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>This letter is in response to your letter to D. McCarty Thornton, concerning 
  the provision of free biopsy needles by laboratories. Specifically, your letter 
  requested guidance as to whether the furnishing of prostate biopsy needles by 
  laboratories without charge to urologists, who refer the biopsies to that laboratory 
  for testing, implicates the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. 42 
  U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b). 
<p>This office has established a procedure for formally responding to requests 
  for advice concerning the anti-kickback statute for a specific arrangement that 
  either is in existence or is one which the requester in good faith plans to 
  undertake. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1008.15; 62 Fed. Reg. 7350, 7358. The 
  request for such an opinion must come from a party that is a participant in 
  the arrangement. Since your request does not concern a particular arrangement, 
  we cannot provide you with a formal opinion. However, we can make some general 
  observations regarding the practices described. 
<p>In general, the anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly 
  and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce, 
  or in return for, the referral of items or services for which payment may be 
  made in whole or in part by a Federal health care program. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 
  1320a-7b(b). In other words, the statute prohibits payments made purposefully 
  in exchange for referrals of business paid for by a Federal health care program. 
  Violation of the anti-kickback statute is a felony punishable by a maximum fine 
  of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The Department of Health 
  and Human Services may also exclude individuals who violate the anti-kickback 
  statute from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>The OIG has stated on numerous occasions its view that the provision of free 
  goods by a seller to an actual or potential referral source may violate the 
  anti-kickback statute depending on the circumstances. In the preamble to the 
  1991 safe harbor regulations, we stated that giving free goods which have an 
  independent value to a physician may violate the anti-kickback statute. 56 Fed. 
  Reg. 35978 (July 1991). More recently, the OIG Fraud Alert relating to the provision 
  of clinical laboratory services stated: 
<p>"whenever a laboratory offers or gives to a source of referrals anything of 
  value not paid for at fair market value, the inference may be made that the 
  thing of value is offered to induce the referral of business." 59 Fed. Reg. 
  65377 (October 1994) 
<p>Finally, we note that among the charges settled in the recent $325 million 
  settlement with SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, Inc., were allegations 
  that SmithKline provided certain free services and supplies to physicians and 
  other referral sources. Charges alleging the provision of free computer and 
  fax machines were also involved in a case against an Ohio physician. In short, 
  our position on the provision of free goods to a referral source is longstanding 
  and clear--any gift to a referral source that has independent value to such 
  source implicates the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>We have recently become aware that some laboratories provide prostate biopsy 
  needles to their physician customers for free. Biopsy needles have a clear independent 
  value to physicians; depending on the type of needle, prices may exceed thirty 
  dollars for a single needle. Further, the cost of these needles may already 
  be included in the practice expense portion of the Medicare payment made to 
  the physician. In these circumstances, an obvious inference is that the biopsy 
  needles are being provided to the physicians by the laboratories in exchange 
  for referrals. Accordingly, we view these arrangements as highly suspect. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p>With regard to the application of the physician self-referral law, Section 
  1877 of the Social Security Act, to the conduct in question, the anti-kickback 
  statute and Section 1877 are independent statutory authorities. A physician 
  must comply with both authorities. In other words, compliance with Section 1877 
  does not afford protection to conduct that is violative of the anti-kickback 
  statute. Unlike Section 1877 which is a civil non-intent based statute, the 
  anti-kickback statute is a criminal, intent-based statute that requires separate 
  analysis. 
<p>We hope this information is helpful. 
<p>Very truly yours, 
<p>/s/
