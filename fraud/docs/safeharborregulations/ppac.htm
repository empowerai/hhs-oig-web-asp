    <b>Statement of Kevin G. McAnaney, Chief, Industry Guidance Branch<br>
    Office of Counsel to the Inspector General</b>
  </center>
<p>The primary mission of the Office of Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) is 
  to investigate and report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the programs 
  of the Department of Health and Human Services, and, in conjunction with the 
  Department of Justice, to enforce various authorities related to health care 
  fraud and abuse involving the Federal health care programs. The OIG does not 
  set Medicare payment policy; that is the responsibility of the Health Care Financing 
  Administration (&quot;HCFA&quot;). 
<p>The OIG has a longstanding and well-known concern with arrangements pursuant 
  to which health care providers routinely waive coinsurance or copayment (collectively, 
  &quot;copayment&quot;) amounts that are required under Medicare, including agreements 
  between insurers and physicians that require physicians to waive Medicare copayment 
  obligations as a condition of participation in an insurance company's network. 
  Arrangements to waive Medicare copayments potentially implicate several criminal 
  and civil statutes, including the Federal anti-kickback statute and the False 
  Claims Act. This is not a new OIG policy. As I am sure the members of this Committee 
  are all too aware, the OIG has repeatedly articulated its concern about any 
  arrangements that operate to waive Medicare copayments routinely.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>The OIG has been looking at how that policy applies to situations in which 
  coordination of benefits (&quot;COB&quot;) provisions in commercial insurance 
  products can operate, in effect, to waive Medicare copayment obligations when 
  the commercial policy is the secondary insurer and Medicare is primary. We became 
  aware of this issue some time ago as a result of complaints from physicians 
  in California. While we are still trying to ascertain the scope of the problem 
  and gain a better appreciation of the difficulties of insurance benefit administration 
  at the plan and physician levels, we have reached some tentative conclusions. 
<p><u>First</u>, as a legal matter, reconciling Medicare copayment requirements 
  with the COB provisions in commercial insurance products involves a complex 
  interaction of legal authorities. Two distinct Federal laws and regulatory schemes 
  are involved: the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&quot;ERISA&quot;) 
  and the Social Security Act. In addition, state law has historically governed 
  the regulation of commercial insurance (including coordination of benefits). 
  However, for self-funded employer plans, ERISA preempts much state law, although 
  when there is preemption, its scope is not always clear. Finally, there are 
  issues arising under the common law of contracts, including the authority of 
  private parties to alter voluntarily obligations imposed by other laws, such 
  as the Social Security Act. 
<p>Despite this analytic complexity, we believe the legal bottom line is clear. 
  The obligation to pay the Medicare copayment is a requirement of the Social 
  Security Act. Federal law governing Federal programs generally trumps any contrary 
  state or contract law. In short, the obligation to pay Medicare copayment amounts 
  is imposed by Federal law; if a plan has assumed a Medicare beneficiary's copayment 
  obligation, the plan should pay the copayment. 
<p><u>Second</u>, we do not believe that every time a secondary insurer's COB 
  provisions result in a waiver of some or all of a Medicare copayment, there 
  is necessarily a violation of law. Historically, COB provisions that are commonly 
  found in insurance policies have <u>occasionally</u> resulted in the waiver 
  of all or part of a Medicare copayment. These occasional waivers were not necessarily 
  illegal, at least under statutes, such as the anti-kickback statute or False 
  Claims Act, that require intent or knowledge as an element of an offense. 
<p>The phenomenal growth of the managed care share of the employer insurance market 
  has changed that equation. Based on the number of complaints from physicians 
  we have received, we believe that in California and some other markets, the 
  physician fee schedules that are being used by some insurance companies for 
  both their commercial and employer product lines are dropping below the Medicare 
  fee schedule for a substantial number of physician and other Part B services. 
  When those fee schedules are combined with the conventional COB provisions in 
  those plans, the result is that plans &quot;free ride&quot; on Medicare, in 
  effect becoming Medigap insurers for nothing. 
<p>In short, what used to be an occasional, inadvertent waiver of Medicare copayments 
  is becoming a routine practice affecting potentially large amounts of money 
  and conferring a substantial financial benefit on commercial insurance plans 
  and their customers. While the OIG has no data on the amount of money involved, 
  we note that HCFA found that the significant difference in cost between comparable 
  Medigap and Medicare Select policies was due largely to the fact that the Medicare 
  Select products are permitted to waive Medicare Part A copayments for inpatient 
  hospital services. We would expect the waiver of Part A and Part B coinsurance 
  obligations to involve similar, if not greater, amounts. Multiplied by the number 
  of Medicare beneficiaries covered by a large insurer, the avoided costs of Medicare 
  copayments could be significant. 
<p><u>Third</u>, given the significant financial benefit to plans, we are concerned 
  that some plans are knowingly manipulating these contractual provisions and 
  their administration of these contracts to avoid their obligation to pay Medicare 
  coinsurance for their own financial benefit. For example, we have received several 
  reports that one plan informs physicians that the physicians are responsible 
  for billing Medicare the plan fee schedule amount if that amount is less than 
  the Medicare fee schedule, while at the same time refusing to disclose the plan 
  fee schedule to those same physicians. 
<p>Based on our current understanding, the insurance companies seem to be the 
  key players. They dictate the terms of the contracts, set the fee schedules, 
  administer the contracts, and receive the immediate financial benefit of the 
  copayment waivers. As to the physicians, they do not seem to have fully appreciated 
  the contractual arrangements to which they have agreed and do not seem to be 
  willing participants in the COB aspect of these arrangements. We emphasize that 
  the beneficiaries are not liable under any scenario, since both physicians and 
  plans have agreed not to balance bill them. 
<p><u>Fourth</u>, we see two alternatives, either of which would resolve our legal 
  concerns. One option is that the plans could agree to pay the Medicare copayments. 
  The other option is that the plans and physicians could contractually agree 
  to bill Medicare the lower plan fee schedule amount when Medicare is the primary 
  payer; Medicare would pay 80% of the lower amount and the plans would pay the 
  remaining 20%. This alternative would require that plans give physicians the 
  plan fee schedule for the purposes of billing Medicare reasonably in advance 
  and that plans make clear to physicians that they are agreeing to bill Medicare 
  the lower plan fee schedule amount, resulting in lower payments to the physicians 
  than they might otherwise receive for a Medicare beneficiary. Again, the plan 
  would pay a 20% copayment based on the lower billed amount. 
<p>Finally, we want to reiterate that our current position is based on incomplete 
  information and may evolve as we develop more information. We would especially 
  welcome input from both the physician community and insurers as to the extent 
  of the disparity between commercial and Medicare fee schedules, the amount of 
  Medicare coinsurance affected, and the practicalities of different solutions, 
  given the complexities of insurance benefit administration both at the plan 
  and physician levels and the widespread dispersion of Medicare beneficiaries 
  among commercial and ERISA group plans that are primarily composed of employees. 
  To the extent possible consistent with law, we need to find a solution that 
  accommodates the practical concerns of benefits administrators and physicians, 
  the needs of employers and commercial insurers, and the requirements of the 
  Medicare program.
