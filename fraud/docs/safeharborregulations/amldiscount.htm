Issued -- April 20, 2000 
<p>[Name and address redacted]
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>Thank you for your letter regarding certain suspect discounting arrangements 
  involving ambulance companies and hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. 
  In your letter, you assert that unscrupulous ambulance providers continue to 
  enter into these arrangements with hospitals and nursing homes and urge this 
  Office to take enforcement action. In the meanwhile, you also ask that we issue 
  a special fraud alert to warn hospitals and nursing homes that these practices 
  are suspect. 
<p>Specifically, the American Ambulance Association is concerned with arrangements 
  involving ambulance companies that give hospitals and nursing facilities deep 
  discounts for business that the facilities pay for out of their own pockets, 
  in return for the referral of more lucrative Medicare Part B business for which 
  the ambulance companies receive direct reimbursement. As you know, these arrangements 
  raise potential issues under both the Federal health care program anti-kickback 
  statute, section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Act"), and the exclusion 
  authority relating to charges to the Medicare or Medicaid programs that are 
  substantially in excess of a provider or supplier's usual charges, section 1128(b)(6)(A) 
  of the Act. These generic issues were the subject of OIG Advisory Opinions 99-2 
  and 99-13. 
<p>With respect to enforcement, the absence of publicized litigation should not 
  be construed as an absence of enforcement activity. Investigations are not generally 
  public, even to the target, and typically take a significant amount of time. 
  Moreover, some health care fraud cases begin as <em>qui tam </em>lawsuits; such 
  lawsuits are filed under seal to protect the relator's identity. Please be advised 
  that various instances of the type of conduct discussed in your letter are being 
  examined. Providers that mistake the absence of visible enforcement as a green 
  light to engage in such pricing arrangements do so at their own jeopardy. 
<p>With respect to the issuance of a special fraud alert, we do not believe a 
  special fraud alert would have any significant additional deterrent effect at 
  this time. OIG Advisory Opinions 99-2 and 99-13 have already received broad 
  dissemination throughout the health care industry. Although the opinions are 
  only binding on the requesting parties, the same analytical framework laid out 
  in the opinions would apply to arrangements between hospitals and ambulance 
  providers. Hospitals, nursing homes, and ambulance companies ignore the learning 
  of those opinions at their own peril. 
<p>OIG advisory opinions, special fraud alerts, and similar guidance sometimes 
  identify certain practices as "suspect" in relation to the Federal health care 
  program anti-kickback statute. We think there may be some misunderstanding as 
  to the import of this identification. First, such designation is based on our 
  assessment that the practice itself is some evidence of a violation. Second, 
  the designation serves as fair warning to the health care industry that they 
  participate in such activities at their own risk. However, these practices are 
  not <em>per se</em> violations of the anti-kickback statute; the statute is 
  a criminal statute and requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the parties 
  had unlawful intent. In other words, it is not only what the parties did, but 
  why they did it, that is crucial to a prosecution. Our guidance identifies the 
  types of practices that we believe potentially violate the statute <u>if</u> 
  there is improper intent. 
<p>In both Advisory Opinions 99-2 and 99-13, our concern was that the proposed 
  conduct potentially involved purposeful discounting of private pay business 
  to induce the referral of Federal health care program business &#173; prohibited 
  conduct under the Federal anti-kickback statute. An anti-kickback statute violation 
  is not determined by the size of the discount; rather, a violation arises if 
  the discount &#173; whatever its size &#173; is implicitly or explicitly tied 
  to referrals of Federal business. Nevertheless, the size of a discount may provide 
  evidence of intent. Accordingly, the opinions identified two pricing benchmarks 
  below which we believe discounts raise anti-kickback concerns. However, discount 
  arrangements below those benchmarks are not illegal <em>per se</em>, but only 
  "suspect" in the sense that they may merit further investigation depending on 
  the facts and circumstances presented. For example, we recognize that there 
  are reasons why a company might agree to sell services below its average fully 
  loaded costs. Notwithstanding, we think that pricing arrangements that couple 
  the referral of Medicare business that is reimbursed above the provider's average 
  fully loaded costs with charges for private business that are below the provider's 
  average fully loaded costs raise significant concerns. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We also want to reiterate that section 1128(b)(6)(A), which permits exclusion 
  of providers that submit claims to Medicare or Medicaid for amounts substantially 
  in excess of the provider's usual charges, is not a blanket prohibition on discounts 
  to private pay customers. Section 1128(b)(6)(A) addresses a much narrower issue 
  &#173; tiered pricing structures that set one price for Medicare or Medicaid 
  and a substantially lower price for most other customers. Given the statutory 
  language, we do not believe that the section 1128(b)(6)(A) is implicated unless 
  a provider's charge to Medicare is substantially in excess of its median non-Medicare/Medicaid 
  charge. In other words, a provider need not even worry about section 1128(b)(6)(A), 
  unless it is discounting close to half of its non-Medicare/Medicaid business. 
  In addition, the statute contains an explicit exception permitting a charge 
  differential where " the Secretary finds there is good cause" for the disparate 
  treatment. Within these parameters, providers are free to negotiate discounts, 
  so long as the discounts are not tied to unlawful referrals of Federal health 
  care program business. 
<p>Finally, if you have any specific information regarding improper arrangements 
  between specific ambulance companies and hospitals or nursing homes, we encourage 
  you to provide such information to our Office of Investigations.
