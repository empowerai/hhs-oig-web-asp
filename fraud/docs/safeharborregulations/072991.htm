<p>Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; OIG Anti-Kickback 
<p>Provisions <br>
  <br>
<p>Monday, July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35952) <br>
  <br>
<p>AGENCY: Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS. 
<p>ACTION: Final rule. 
<p>SUMMARY: This final rule implements section 14 of Public Law 100-93, the Medicare 
  and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, by specifying various 
  payment practices which, although potentially capable of inducing referrals 
  of business under Medicare or a State health care program, will be protected 
  from criminal prosecution or civil sanctions under the anti-kickback provisions 
  of the statute. 
<p>EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective on July 29, 1991. 
<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
<p>Thomas S. Crane or D. McCarty Thornton, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 
  619-0335. 
<p>Joel Schaer, Office of Inspector General, (202) 619-3270. 
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<p>I. Background 
<p>A. The Medicare Anti-Kickback Statute 
<p>Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)), previously 
  codified at sections 1877 and 1909 of the Act, provides criminal penalties for 
  individuals or entities that knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or 
  receive remuneration in order to induce business reimbursed under the Medicare 
  or State health care programs. The offense is classified as a felony, and is 
  punishable by fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. 
<p>This provision is extremely broad. The types of remuneration covered specifically 
  include kickbacks, bribes, and rebates made directly or indirectly, overtly 
  or covertly, or in cash or in kind. In addition, prohibited conduct includes 
  not only remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients, but remuneration 
  also intended to induce the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for 
  any good, facility, service, or item paid for by Medicare or State health care 
  programs. 
<p>Since the statute on its face is so broad, concern has arisen among a number 
  of health care providers that many relatively innocuous, or even beneficial, 
  commercial arrangements are technically covered by the statute and are, therefore, 
  subject to criminal prosecution. 
<p>B. Public Law 100-93 
<p>Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection 
  Act of 1987, added two new provisions addressing the anti-kickback statute. 
  Section 2 specifically provided new authority to the Office of Inspector General 
  (OIG) to exclude an individual or entity from participation in the Medicare 
  and State health care programs if it is determined that the party has engaged 
  in a prohibited remuneration scheme. (Section 1128(b)(7) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 
  1320a-7(b)(7)) This new sanction authority is intended to provide an alternative 
  civil remedy, short of criminal prosecution, that will be a more effective way 
  of regulating abusive business practices than is the case under criminal law. 
<p>In addition, section 14 of Public Law 100-93 requires the promulgation of regulations 
  specifying those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal prosecution 
  under section 1128B of the Act and that will not provide a basis for exclusion 
  from the Medicare program or from the State health care programs under section 
  1128(b)(7) of the Act. 
<p>C. Notice of Intent 
<p>The legislative history of section 14 of Public Law 100-93 indicates that Congress 
  expected the Department of Health and Human Services to consult with affected 
  provider, practitioner, supplier and beneficiary representatives before promulgating 
  regulations. In order to most effectively address issues related to this provision, 
  we published a notice of intent to develop regulations (52 FR 38794, October 
  19, 1987) soliciting comments from interested parties prior to developing a 
  proposed regulation. As a result of that notice, the OIG received a number of 
  public comments, recommendations and suggestions on generic criteria that can 
  be applied to particular types of business arrangements in order to determine 
  if such arrangements are inappropriate for civil or criminal sanctions. 
<p>D. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<p>The proposed regulation designed to implement section 14 of Public Law 100-93 
  was developed by the OIG and published in the Federal Register on January 23, 
  1989 (54 FR 3088). The regulation sets forth various proposed business and payment 
  practices, or "safe harbors," that would not be treated as criminal offenses 
  under section 1128B(b) of the Act and would not serve as a basis for a program 
  exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act. As a result of that proposed 
  rulemaking, we received a total of 754 public comments for consideration. 
<p>II. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
<p>A. Business Arrangements Not Exempt 
<p>The proposed regulation indicated that in order for a business arrangement 
  to comply with one of the ten safe harbors, each standard of that safe harbor 
  provision would have to be met. The proposed rule stated that if the business 
  arrangement involves payments for different purposes (for example a single payment 
  for personal services and for equipment rental) then each payment purpose would 
  be analyzed to determine if all the standards of each applicable safe harbor 
  provision have been fulfilled. The proposed rule further specified that where 
  individuals and entities have entered into arrangements that are covered by 
  the statute and where they have chosen not to fully comply with one of the exemptions 
  proposed in these regulations, they would risk scrutiny by the OIG and may be 
  subject to civil or criminal enforcement action. 
<p>B. Need for Continuing Guidance 
<p>Since there may be a need for the Department to respond to changes in health 
  care delivery or business arrangements more quickly and informally than through 
  the regulatory process to keep the industry abreast of our enforcement policy, 
  the proposed rule invited public comment on how we can best achieve the dual 
  goals of keeping the industry aware of our views of particular business practices, 
  and assuring that our regulations remain current with new developments. 
<p>C. Notice to Beneficiaries 
<p>While we considered including in several of the proposed safe harbor provisions 
  a requirement that a person notify each Medicare or Medicaid patient he or she 
  refers to a related entity of the financial relationship that exists, we indicated 
  that such notice requirements may be unduly burdensome compared with the potential 
  benefits and, therefore, did not include the requirement in the safe harbors 
  in the proposed regulation. Instead, we invited public comments on this issue. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>D. Preferred Provider Organizations 
<p>We cited the increasing variety of arrangements among entities grouped under 
  the generic headings "preferred provider organizations" (PPOs) or "managed care," 
  and that unlike HMOs, there is often no single entity that is recognized as 
  the "health care provider." The proposed regulations did not specifically delineate 
  a safe harbor provision for these arrangements since we believed that one or 
  more of the other proposed safe harbors would often cover relationships in preferred 
  provider and managed care networks. We invited comments from the public, however, 
  on the idea of adding additional safe harbors that would provide further protection 
  to HMOs, PPOs, and other managed care plans. 
<p>E. Waiver of Coinsurance and Deductible Amounts for Inpatient Hospital Care 
<p>We noted that with the advent in 1983 of the prospective payment system for 
  paying hospitals for inpatient care, some hospitals have advertised the routine 
  waiver of Medicare coinsurance and deductible amounts as a means of attracting 
  patients to their facilities. We solicited comments on defining a safe harbor 
  for waiving coinsurance and deductible amounts that would be limited to inpatient 
  hospital care, be available to all Medicare beneficiaries without regard to 
  diagnosis or length of stay, and assure that any costs to the hospital of waiving 
  the coinsurance and deductible amounts would not be passed on to any Federal 
  program as a bad debt or in any other way. 
<p>F. Proposed Safe Harbors 
<p>The regulation published on January 23, 1989, proposing to amend 42 CFR part 
  1001 by adding a new &#167; 1001.952, set forth "safe harbors" in ten broad 
  areas: 
<p>1. Investment Interests 
<p>To reflect the view that Congress did not intend to bar all investments by 
  physicians in other health care entities to which they refer patients, a safe 
  harbor provision was proposed for investment interests in large public corporations 
  where such investments are available to the general public. This safe harbor 
  described a minimum number of shareholders and a minimum number of assets the 
  company must have in order to qualify under this provision. 
<p>Safe harbors for limited and managing partnerships were considered under the 
  proposed regulation, but were not included. These areas were discussed in the 
  preamble of the proposed rule, and we specifically requested public comments 
  on adopting these practices as safe harbors. 
<p>2. Space Rental 
<p>While many rental arrangements are legitimate, many situations exist where 
  rental payments are simply a device used to mask illegal payments intended to 
  induce referrals. Accordingly, a safe harbor provision was proposed for rental 
  arrangements if: (a) Access to the space is for periodic intervals and such 
  intervals are set in advance in the lease, rather than based on the number of 
  referred patients; (b) the lease is for at least one year so it cannot be readjusted 
  on too frequent a basis to reflect prior referrals; and (c) the charges reflect 
  fair market value. 
<p>3. Equipment Rental 
<p>With the understanding that the payment for the use of diagnostic and other 
  medical equipment may simply be a vehicle to provide reimbursement for referrals, 
  a safe harbor was proposed for certain situations involving equipment rentals 
  similar to those applied to real estate rentals cited above. 
<p>4. Personal Services and Management Contracts 
<p>While health care providers often have arrangements to perform services for 
  each other on a mutually beneficial basis, some of these arrangements may vary 
  the payment with the volume of referrals. The proposed regulation set forth 
  a safe harbor provision for joint ventures and other arrangements involving 
  payments for personal services or management contracts, but only if certain 
  standards are met that limit the opportunity to provide financial incentives 
  in exchange for referrals. This proposed provision required the services to 
  be paid at fair market value, and was predicated on requirements similar to 
  those set forth in the provisions for space and equipment rental. 
<p>5. Sale of Practice 
<p>Unlike the traditional sale of a practice by a retiring physician, a physician 
  may sell, or appear to sell, a practice to a hospital while continuing to practice 
  on its staff. A safe harbor provision was proposed for the sale of physician 
  practices when occurring as the result of retirement or some other event that 
  removes the physician from the practice of medicine or from the service area 
  in which he or she was practicing, but not when the sale is for the purpose 
  of obtaining an ongoing source of patient referrals. 
<p>6. Referral Services 
<p>Professional societies and other consumer-oriented groups often operate referral 
  services for a fee. Because such a service fee could be construed as a payment 
  in order to obtain a referral, we concluded that it was appropriate to establish 
  a specific safe harbor for this type of practice. In order to safeguard against 
  abuse, however, the provision is only available when several standards are met. 
<p>7. Warranties 
<p>It is in the public interest to have companies offer warranties as an inducement 
  to the consumer to purchase a product. A safe harbor was proposed for such purposes. 
<p>8. Discounts 
<p>Safe harbors relating to discounts, employees and group purchasing organizations 
  are specifically required by statute. The discount exception was intended to 
  encourage price competition that benefits the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
  The proposed discount provision was limited in application to reductions in 
  the amount a seller charges for a good or service to the buyer. The discount 
  could take the form of a specified price break, or the inclusion of an extra 
  quantity of the item purchased "at no extra charge." We did not propose to protect 
  many kinds of marketing incentive programs such as cash rebates, free goods 
  or services, redeemable coupons, or credits. 
<p>9. Employees 
<p>The proposed exception for employees permitted an employer to pay an employee 
  in whatever manner he or she chose for having that employee assist in the solicitation 
  of program business and applied only to bona fide employee- employer relationships. 
<p>10. Group Purchasing Organizations 
<p>The proposed group purchasing organization (GPO) exception was designed to 
  apply to payments from vendors to entities authorized to act as a GPO for individuals 
  or entities who are furnishing Medicare or Medicaid services. The proposed exception 
  required a written agreement between the GPO and the individual or entity that 
  specifies the amounts vendors will pay the GPO. 
<p>III. Response to Comments and Summary of Revisions 
<p>As indicated above, in response to the proposed rulemaking we received 754 
  public comments from various provider groups, medical facilities, professional 
  and business organizations and associations, medical societies, State and local 
  government entities, private <strong>(35954)</strong> practitioners and concerned 
  citizens. The comments included both general and broadreaching concerns regarding 
  the impact of this regulation, and specific comments on those areas and safe 
  harbor provisions about which we requested public input. A summary of the comments 
  received and our responses to those comments follows. <br>
  <br>
<p>A. General Comments 
<p>Comment: A large number of commenters expressed concern about the implication 
  of engaging in a business arrangement that does not comply fully with a provision 
  of this regulation. Some of these commenters expressed the view that the safe 
  harbor provisions are narrowly drawn and leave many lawful business arrangements 
  unprotected. Moreover, the preamble to the proposed rule warns: "[W]here individuals 
  and entities have entered into arrangements that are covered by the statute, 
  where they have chosen not to comply fully with one of the exemptions in these 
  regulations, they would risk scrutiny by the OIG * * *." These commenters urged 
  the OIG to make clear that the failure to comply fully with a safe harbor provision 
  is not per se illegal, and does not mean that prosecution will automatically 
  follow. In addition, they requested safe harbor protection for business arrangements 
  where there has only been a "technical violation" of the statute, where there 
  has been "substantial compliance" with this regulation, or where the remuneration 
  in question is "de minimis." 
<p>Response: This regulation covers many categories of business arrangements, 
  providing standards to be met within each safe harbor provision. If a person 
  participates in an arrangement that fully complies with a given provision, he 
  or she will be assured of not being prosecuted criminally or civilly for the 
  arrangement that is the subject of that provision. 
<p>This regulation does not expand the scope of activities that the statute prohibits. 
  The statute itself describes the scope of illegal activities. The legality of 
  a particular business arrangement must be determined by comparing the particular 
  facts to the proscriptions of the statute. 
<p>The failure to comply with a safe harbor can mean one of three things. First, 
  as we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, it may mean that the arrangement 
  does not fall within the ambit of the statute. In other words, the arrangement 
  is not intended to induce the referral of business reimbursable under Medicare 
  or Medicaid; so there is no reason to comply with the safe harbor standards, 
  and no risk of prosecution. 
<p>Second, at the other end of the spectrum, the arrangement could be a clear 
  statutory violation and also not qualify for safe harbor protection. In that 
  case, assuming the arrangement is obviously abusive, prosecution would be very 
  likely. 
<p>Third, the arrangement may violate the statute in a less serious manner, although 
  not be in compliance with a safe harbor provision. Here there is no way to predict 
  the degree of risk. Rather, the degree of the risk depends on an evaluation 
  of the many factors which are part of the decision-making process regarding 
  case selection for investigation and prosecution. Certainly, in many (but not 
  necessarily all) instances, prosecutorial discretion would be exercised not 
  to pursue cases where the participants appear to have acted in a genuine good-faith 
  attempt to comply with the terms of a safe harbor, but for reasons beyond their 
  control are not in compliance with the terms of that safe harbor. In other instances, 
  there may not even be an applicable safe harbor, but the arrangement may appear 
  innocuous. But in other instances, we will want to take appropriate action. 
<p>We do not believe the Medicare and Medicaid programs would be properly served 
  if we assured protection in all instances of "substantial compliance," "technical 
  violations," or "de minimis" payments. Unfortunately, these are vague concepts, 
  subject to differing interpretations. In this regulation, we have attempted 
  to provide bright lines, to the extent possible, for safe harbors in order to 
  provide clarity and predictability as to what conduct is immune from government 
  action. Our endorsement of the concepts mentioned above would only serve to 
  blur these lines and produce litigation as to what "substantial," "technical" 
  and "de minimis" really mean. The OIG therefore declines to adopt these concepts. 
<p>A recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit 
  provides an indication of the litigation problems that could arise if "substantial 
  compliance" with a safe harbor provision was all that was required. <em>United 
  States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hospital Rental Service, Inc</em>., 874 F.2d 
  20 (1st Cir., 1989) involved an arrangement between an employee of a city owned 
  hospital (Felci) and an ambulance company (Bay State). Felci was involved in 
  the administration of the city's ambulance service contract. During this period, 
  Bay State retained Felci as a consultant, provided him with two automobiles, 
  and paid Felci's consulting company several thousand dollars. When it came time 
  for renewal of the ambulance contract, Felci used his position and influence 
  at the city hospital to assist Bay State in securing the new contract. Felci 
  was prosecuted and convicted under the statute. 
<p>In affirming Felci's conviction (as well as that of Bay State's president, 
  Kotzen), the First Circuit rejected Felci's contention that he had substantially 
  complied with this regulation as published as a notice of proposed rulemaking, 
  and thus should not be prosecuted. The court found: "The proposed regulation 
  does not exempt every transaction in which the amount paid for services is an 
  amount consistent with fair market value; rather it exempts only a small subset 
  of such transactions * * *. [U]nder the circumstances such as the present case 
  where the consulting arrangement is not full-time, * * * stringent requirements 
  are necessary to meet the exemption from criminal liability. HHS has thus decided 
  not to create a safe harbor for transactions such as the present case." (Emphasis 
  in original; footnote omitted) Id. 874 F.2d at 31. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters described business arrangements that technically 
  may violate the statute, but do not increase costs to the Medicare or Medicaid 
  programs, or otherwise injure beneficiaries. They requested safe harbor protection 
  for these arrangements because of concern of their risk of being scrutinized. 
<p>Response: Increased cost to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and harm to 
  beneficiaries are not the only criteria we look at in determining whether a 
  particular business arrangement is abusive. As the court in <em>United States 
  v. Ruttenberq</em>, 625 F.2d 173, 177, n.9 (7th Cir. 1980) noted: 
<p>[T]he law does not make increased cost to the government the sole criterion 
  of corruption. In prohibiting "kickbacks," Congress need not have spelled out 
  the obvious truisms that, while unnecessary expenditure of money earned and 
  contributed by taxpaying fellow citizens may exacerbate the result of the crime, 
  kickback schemes can freeze competing suppliers from the system, can mask the 
  possibility of government price reductions, can misdirect program funds, and, 
  when proportional, can erect strong temptations to order more drugs and supplies 
  than needed. 
<p>Furthermore, it is unfortunately not possible to provide safe harbor protections 
  for all business arrangements that are not abusive. There are certain arrangements 
  that, although themselves legitimate, are structurally so similar to abusive 
  arrangements that protection by way of new safe harbor provisions will inevitably 
  also protect abusive practices as well. For example, equipment rental arrangements 
  made between parties in a position to make and accept referrals do not receive 
  safe harbor protection if the payments are based on utilization (sometimes known 
  as a "wear and tear" clause). We recognize that equipment becomes less valuable 
  the more it is used, and that its owner deserves compensation for such wear 
  and tear. However, it is also a relatively easy matter to disguise such a wear 
  and tear payment as a payment for referrals. Thus, we need to examine the intent 
  of the parties on a case-by-case basis even though a large majority of such 
  payments may represent only legitimate compensation to the owner of the equipment. 
<p>The recent case, <em>United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hospital Rental 
  Service, Inc</em>., discussed above, emphasizes that the gravamen of a violation 
  of the statute is "inducement" and not necessarily the structure of the arrangement. 
  Id. 874 F.2d at 29. Thus, such case by case inquiries must necessarily focus 
  on the intent of the parties. 
<p>The <em>Bay State Ambulance</em> case also illustrates the risk health care 
  providers engage in when they enter into a business arrangement that violates 
  the statute, but try to argue that the arrangement does not increase program 
  costs or result in overutilization. The First Circuit rejected the defendants' 
  arguments that there would have been no fiscal drain on public programs because 
  ambulance services and Medicare reimbursement would have been required no matter 
  which ambulance service company had received the contract. The court noted that 
  it was unclear whether Medicare paid Bay State more for these services than 
  it would have paid to the losing bidder even though that bidder's charges were 
  lower. The court observed: "Although the reason for enacting the statute was 
  to prevent drains on the public fisc, the statute does not require that there 
  be a drain on the public fisc in order for payments to be illegal." <em>Id</em>. 
  n.21, 874 F.2d at 32. 
<p>Comment: Numerous commenters expressed concern about the difficulty in revising 
  a business arrangement that they entered into with a good-faith belief that 
  the arrangement did not violate the statute, but which they now find does not 
  qualify under one of the safe harbor provisions. They suggested that the OIG 
  either "grandfather" these arrangements or provide a reasonable period of time 
  before initiating enforcement action to enable health care providers to restructure 
  their arrangements to meet the safe harbor provisions. 
<p>Response: The failure of a particular business arrangement to comply with these 
  provisions does not determine whether or not the arrangement violates the statute 
  because, as we stated above, this regulation does not make conduct illegal. 
  Any conduct that could be construed to be illegal after the promulgation of 
  this rule would have been illegal at any time since the current law was enacted 
  in 1977. Thus illegal arrangements entered into in the past were undertaken 
  with a risk of prosecution. This regulation is intended to provide a formula 
  for avoiding risk in the future. 
<p>We also recognize, however, that many health care providers have structured 
  their business arrangements based on the advice of an attorney and in good- 
  faith believed that the arrangement was legal. In the event that they now find 
  that the arrangement does not comply fully with a particular safe harbor provision 
  and are working with diligence and good faith to restructure it so that it does 
  comply, we will use our discretion to be fair to the parties to such arrangements. 
<p>Nonetheless, we believe that it would be inappropriate for us to provide a 
  blanket protection, even for a limited period of time, for all business arrangements 
  that do not qualify for a safe harbor. As we stated above, certain business 
  arrangements that do not qualify may warrant immediate enforcement action. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters discussed the interrelationships between these safe 
  harbor provisions and reimbursement rules promulgated by the Health Care Financing 
  Administration (HCFA). A few of these commenters appeared to suggest that if 
  a health care provider complied with a particular safe harbor provision, then 
  its reimbursement may be affected. 
<p>Response: We wish to emphasize that nothing in this regulation changes reimbursement 
  rules promulgated by HCFA or a State health care program. Clearly if a provider 
  chooses to engage in one course of conduct in order to comply with these safe 
  harbor provisions, such action may very well have reimbursement implications. 
  However, such reimbursement is governed exclusively by HCFA or State regulations, 
  and not by this regulation. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters requested that the OIG publish this regulation 
  with an additional comment period because of the complexity of the issues involved 
  and the revisions or additions of new safe harbor provisions created as a result 
  of the comments. 
<p>Response: We believe that the disadvantages of providing an additional comment 
  period outweigh the benefits. As we stated above, we received extensive comments 
  in response to this proposed rule. In addition, due to the novelty and complexity 
  of these issues, we started this process with a special notice of intent to 
  develop regulations, (52 FR 38794, October 19, 1987) and received over 150 comments, 
  which we used to develop the proposed rule. 
<p>Also weighing against any benefit of receiving additional comments on this 
  rule is the desirability of providing the level of certainty that accompanies 
  a final rule. This will permit individuals and entities to structure business 
  arrangements under the provisions of this rule with the assurance that it will 
  not change in the near future. Such assurance is delayed somewhat by providing 
  an additional comment period. 
<p>We acknowledge the congressional expectation that we should "formally re- evaluate 
  the anti-kickback regulations on a periodic basis, and, in so doing, * * * solicit 
  public comment at the outset of the review process." H.R. Rep. No. 85, part 
  2, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 27 (1987). We believe it is most appropriate to allow 
  all parties time to obtain experience with these safe harbor provisions in their 
  final form before we solicit additional public comments to start our formal 
  re-evaluation process. 
<p>Nonetheless, we received many comments requesting safe harbor protection for 
  a number of business arrangements, many of which deserve safe harbor protection. 
  As discussed in more detail below in section III.B.3. of this preamble, the 
  comments we received on HMOs, PPOs, and other managed care plans warrant the 
  creation of two new safe harbor provisions. Because of the lack of specificity 
  in those comments, we expect to publish these provisions as a separate interim 
  final regulation at a later date. While this provision will be effective upon 
  publication, the public will have an opportunity to submit their specific comments 
  and concerns regarding this new safe harbor. 
<p>In addition, as discussed in more detail below in section III.B. of this preamble, 
  many other arrangements brought to our attention were for arrangements on which 
  we did not solicit comments. Because some of these arrangements may deserve 
  safe harbor<strong> (35956) </strong>protection, we anticipate publishing additional 
  safe harbor provisions in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking. Any discussion 
  below indicating that we are considering a new safe harbor provision should 
  in no way be construed as legalizing the business arrangement at this time. 
<p>Comment: Numerous commenters suggested that the OIG should employ a cease and 
  desist mechanism. Some suggested that the OIG should be required to employ such 
  a mechanism before it initiates a criminal prosecution or program exclusion. 
  Others supported the use of this mechanism because they believed that many business 
  arrangements that violate the statute do not warrant prosecution but should 
  be stopped. 
<p>Response: We do not have the authority to seek or issue a legally enforceable 
  order directing a person to cease and desist from a particular unlawful kickback 
  activity. We recognize that there may be situations where it may be appropriate 
  to inform a person that he or she is violating the statute, and request that 
  the unlawful activity be stopped. Where the person takes immediate action to 
  conform his activity to the law, we may decide that no further action is warranted. 
  However, there may be other situations where criminal prosecution is appropriate 
  even though the person has stopped the illegal activity. Since we lack the power 
  to issue or seek a legally enforceable cease and desist order, we cannot rely 
  on that mechanism as a significant enforcement tool. 
<p>Comment: Three commenters suggested that because many business arrangements 
  will not meet the safe harbor provisions, the regulation was of limited value. 
  They suggested that health care providers would be better aided if the OIG would 
  provide examples of arrangements that violate the statute. 
<p>Response: As we stated above, the purpose of this regulation is not to describe 
  illegal conduct, but rather to set forth standards for certain safe harbors. 
  If an individual or entity engages in a business arrangement that is the subject 
  of a safe harbor provision and complies with all of its provisions, that individual 
  will be assured that he or she will not be prosecuted. However, we recognize 
  the desirability of communicating to the public the existence of other business 
  practices and arrangements that we believe are subject to serious abuse. Accordingly, 
  we issued a special OIG Fraud Alert on joint venture arrangements that described 
  various suspect features of these business ventures that may result in a violation 
  of the statute. As the need arises, we intend to issue other fraud alerts that 
  will provide guidance to the public on other types of arrangements. 
<p>Comment: In seeking guidance with respect to transactions or practices not 
  covered by any specific safe harbor provision, many commenters requested the 
  OIG to include within this regulation a list of generic criteria it would consider 
  in evaluating business arrangements under the statute. These commenters cite 
  a variety of positive and negative factors as relevant generic criteria, including 
  on the positive side whether the arrangement has "a legitimate business purpose" 
  or promotes the delivery of needed services, particularly to indigent, elderly, 
  or rural populations; and on the negative side whether the arrangement promotes 
  overutilization, interferes with patient freedom of choice, diminishes the quality 
  of care provided, or increases costs to beneficiaries or to the government. 
  Some commenters pointed out that the legislative history of Public Law 100-93 
  directs the Department to include in the rules "any generic criteria that might 
  apply to business arrangements generally." H.R. Rep. No. 85, part 2, 100th Cong., 
  1st Sess. 27 (1987). 
<p>Response: We believe the same generic criteria applicable to all business arrangements 
  would not provide useful guidance to the extent that they are based on value 
  judgments regarding the relative advantages (e.g., lower cost or improved accessibility) 
  and disadvantages (e.g., higher cost or overutilization) of the arrangement. 
  It would be virtually impossible to set forth rules describing how we intend 
  to apply them. For example, the determination of whether a joint venture has 
  a legitimate business purpose, is a matter of subjective judgment, and we believe 
  the use of such criteria would invite litigation because health care providers 
  will not be sure if they are complying with them. 
<p>An example of the problems in using these types of generic criteria can be 
  seen if we attempted to provide safe harbor protection for business arrangements 
  that have a "legitimate business purpose." The statute proscribes the giving 
  of rebates as a form of remuneration to induce referrals. Yet rebates are legitimate 
  and common business practices outside the health care services business sector. 
  For the numerous people who engage in both health care and non-health care lines 
  of business, they may have become accustomed to providing various inducements 
  to others in their non-health care activities. They may now start to provide 
  similar inducements in their health care lines of business in a manner that 
  violates the statute. To them, these inducements have a "legitimate business 
  purpose," that is, to gain referrals and thereby make money, yet the practice 
  is expressly prohibited by the statute. 
<p>We believe that Congress did not require us to specify such generic criteria. 
  The House Committee Report so often cited by commenters directs us to promulgate 
  rules that, "to the extent practical, contain * * * any generic criteria that 
  might apply to business arrangements generally." Id. We believe that we have 
  done so. It was only practical to include generic criteria for specific categories 
  of arrangements, such as "fair market value" in the "space rental" safe harbor. 
  We have concluded, however, that a single set of standards for all business 
  arrangements would be of extremely limited value because the subjectivity or 
  arbitrariness in applying the standards to individual fact situations would 
  make such standards of extremely limited value. 
<p>We recognize that some of the factors cited by commenters are useful in determining 
  the extent to which a particular arrangement is abusive, and therefore likely 
  to be prosecuted. For example, the more an arrangement involving remuneration 
  offered to induce referrals increases Medicare or Medicaid program costs or 
  results in unnecessary utilization, the more likely it would be that we would 
  have an interest in prosecuting the offense. It must be emphasized that these 
  are not the only factors upon which a determination regarding prosecution is 
  based, and as we have noted "the statute does not require that there be a drain 
  on the public fisc in order for payments to be illegal." <em>United States v. 
  Bay State Ambulance and Hospital Rental Service, Inc</em>., <em>supra,</em> 
  874 F.2d at 32, n. 21. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters objected to the regulation because they believed 
  that the OIG had exceeded its statutory authority. In particular, they commented 
  that the OIG does not have authority under section 14 of Public Law 100-93 to 
  narrow the scope of the statutory exceptions, particularly the "discount" exception 
  of section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of the Act. They cited the last sentence of section 
  14(a) which states, "Any practices specified in regulations pursuant to [sec. 
  14 of Pub. L. 100-93] shall be in addition to the practices described in subparagraphs 
  (A) through (C) of section 1128B(b)(3)." This sentence led some commenters to 
  conclude that our regulatory authority<strong> </strong>does not permit us to 
  refine or clarify the statutory exceptions. 
<p>Response: We believe that these commenters have misconstrued the intent of 
  this sentence. The plain language of the first sentence of section 14(a) of 
  Public Law 100-93 requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations "specifying 
  payment practices that shall not be treated as a criminal offense under section 
  1128B(b) of the Social Security Act and shall not serve as the basis for an 
  exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of such Act." We believe that the second 
  sentence, which was quoted by many commenters, requires us to add to the exceptions 
  provided in section 1128B(b)(3) of the Act. But we do not believe the intent 
  of this sentence is to prohibit us from interpreting statutory terms used in 
  these exceptions. The clear congressional intent behind the development of these 
  safe harbor provisions is to define innocuous arrangements that should not be 
  prosecuted, including the statutory exceptions. We believe it is in the public 
  interest to provide the health care community with our interpretation of the 
  meaning of certain important statutory terms, for example, "appropriately reflect" 
  in the discount exception or "bona fide employment relationship" in the employee-employer 
  exception. 
<p>Comment: One commenter asked the OIG to clarify how it expects health care 
  providers to comply with this regulation when it engages in a business arrangement 
  that may be covered by two or more of the provisions of this regulation. 
<p>Response: This comment addresses two potential situations. The first situation 
  arises where a payment practice serves a single purpose (e.g., compensation 
  for personal services), but potentially fits into more than one safe harbor 
  (e.g., the employer-employee safe harbor and the personal services and management 
  contracts safe harbor). In this situation, if the payment practice fits into 
  either one of the safe harbors, it is exempt from criminal prosecution and program 
  exclusion. In the example given, if the payment practice does not qualify as 
  a bona fide employment relationship, it still may receive safe harbor protection 
  under the personal services and management contract safe harbor. 
<p>The second situation arises where a payment practice serves multiple purposes 
  (e.g., a payment to recompensate another party for personal services and equipment 
  rental). Under these circumstances, it will be necessary to examine each aspect 
  of the payment practice to determine compliance with each respective safe harbor 
  provision. A person engaged in a "multi-purpose" payment practice who seeks 
  protection will need to document separately his or her compliance with the safe 
  harbor applicable to each purpose being served by the payment practice. Compliance 
  with one provision (for one of the purposes of the payment practice) would not 
  insulate the entire payment practice from criminal prosecution or program exclusion, 
  where another purpose of the payment practice is implemented in a manner which 
  violates the statute. 
<p>In the provision-by-provision analysis in section III.C. below, we will discuss 
  specific comments and our responses to other special issues regarding the interrelationships 
  of these provisions. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters requested that the OIG clarify the relationship between 
  the statute and various State laws. 
<p>Response: Issues of state law are completely independent of the federal anti- 
  kickback statute and these regulations. There is no federal preemption provision 
  under the statute. Thus, conduct that is lawful under the federal anti-kickback 
  statute or this regulation may still be illegal under State law. Conversely, 
  conduct that is lawful under State law may still be illegal under the federal 
  anti-kickback statute. 
<p>Comment: We received many comments on the proposed "Ethics in Patient Referrals 
  Act" then pending in Congress aimed at restricting physicians from referring 
  patients to entities in which they have a financial interest, the so- called 
  "Stark Bill." Many of these commenters asked the OIG to either support or oppose 
  this legislation. Others asked the OIG to clarify the relationship of this legislation 
  to the anti-kickback statute and this regulation. 
<p>Response: This legislation was enacted as section 6204 of the Omnibus Budget 
  Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101-239, adding a new section 1877 to 
  the Act. With numerous exceptions, it generally restricts physicians from making 
  referrals for clinical laboratory services to entities in which they have an 
  ownership or other compensation arrangement. These referral restrictions become 
  effective on January 1, 1992. 
<p>The legislation, although in many respects aimed at the same problems as we 
  are addressing in this regulation, requires different elements of proof and 
  has different remedies than under the anti-kickback statute. Generally, section 
  1877 is violated when a "financial relationship" exists between an entity furnishing 
  clinical laboratory services and a physician, and a referral is made or a claim 
  or bill is presented. For the anti-kickback statute to be violated, it must 
  be shown that the remuneration between the two parties was intended to induce 
  the referral of business payable under Medicare or Medicaid. Whereas the anti-kickback 
  statute contains criminal penalties, violations under section 1877 will result 
  in a denial of payment and may result in the imposition of civil money penalties 
  and program exclusions under section 1128A of the Act. 
<p>Because of these differences between the two provisions, the conference report 
  includes the following clarification: 
<p>The conferees wish to clarify that any prohibition, exemption, or exception 
  authorized under this provision in no way alters (or reflects on) the scope 
  and application of the anti-kickback provisions in section 1128B of the Social 
  Security Act. The conferees do not intend that this provision should be construed 
  as affecting, or in any way interfering, with the efforts of the Inspector General 
  to enforce current law, such as cases described in the recent Fraud Alert issued 
  by the Inspector General. In particular, entities which would be eligible for 
  a specific exemption would be subject to all of the provisions of current law. 
<p>H.R. Conf. Rep. 239, 101st Cong., 1st sess. 856 (1989). 
<p>This clear expression of legislative intent to keep enforcement under the anti-kickback 
  statute separate from enforcement under section 1877 makes it inappropriate 
  to adjust our safe harbor provisions to take into account any exception or prohibition 
  under section 1877. 
<p>Comment: Thirty-three commenters reacted to our comments in the preamble of 
  the proposed rule regarding the breadth and scope of the statute. Fourteen commenters 
  suggested that these regulations should in no way undermine the scope or strength 
  of the statute. These commenters believe that by adding the civil exclusion 
  remedy for the kickback violations as part of Public Law 100- 93, Congress sent 
  a clear and appropriate message to the health care community not to place financial 
  considerations above beneficiaries' interests. Two commenters requested that 
  the statute's term "to refer" should be defined. Other commenters were concerned 
  that diminishing the reach of the statute would create conflicts of interest 
  between health care providers and their patients, and impugn the professional 
  image of physicians. A few commenters opposed the implementation of any safe 
  harbor provisions whatsoever. 
<p>Response: Our charge from Congress under section 14 of Public Law 100-93 is 
  to clarify what payment practices will not subject a person to criminal prosecution 
  or exclusion from the Medicare or State health care programs. The process involves 
  both a determination of the scope of the statute and decisions as to how to 
  draft the safe harbor provisions so that they protect only non-abusive relationships. 
<p>With respect to the scope of the statute, we do not believe that it is necessary 
  to define any of the statute's terms in the regulation itself. However, the 
  meaning of two of its terms deserve comment (1) "any remuneration (including 
  any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, 
  in cash or in kind;" and (2) "to induce." These terms demonstrate congressional 
  intent to create a very broadly worded prohibition. Our comments in the preamble 
  to the proposed rule reflected our belief that Congress ratified this intent 
  in their mandate to create these safe harbor provisions. 
<p>Congress's intent in placing the term "remuneration" in the statute in 1977 
  was to cover the transferring of anything of value in any form or manner whatsoever. 
  The statute's language makes clear that illegal payments are prohibited beyond 
  merely "bribes," "kickbacks," and "rebates," which were the three terms used 
  in the original 1972 statute. The language "directly or indirectly, overtly 
  or covertly, in cash or in kind" makes clear that the form or manner of the 
  payment includes indirect, covert, and in kind transactions. Moreover, the statutory 
  exception for discounts demonstrates that Congress prohibited transactions where 
  there is no direct payment at all from the party receiving the referrals. 
<p>The remuneration in a discount is merely a lowered price that a purchaser would 
  otherwise obtain from a seller, which is made as an inducement to purchase larger 
  quantities. 
<p>The statute's legislative history supports this reading of the term "remuneration," 
  and makes clear that the fundamental analysis required of a trier of fact is 
  "to recognize that the substance rather than simply the form of a transaction 
  should be controlling" (123 Cong. Rec. 30,280 (1977), Statement of Chairman 
  of the House Committee on Ways and Means and principal author of H.R. 3, Representative 
  Rostenkowski). Also see H.R. Rep. No. 393, part II, 95th Cong., lst Sess. 53; 
  reprinted in (1977) U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3056; S.Rep. No. 453, 95th 
  Cong., lst Sess. 12 (1977). 
<p>The meaning of the term "to induce," which describes the intent of those who 
  offer or pay remuneration in paragraph (2) of the statute, is found in the ordinary 
  dictionary definition: "to lead or move by influence or persuasion" (The American 
  Heritage Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1982)). 
<p>The OIG's interpretation of the statute is fully supported by its case law. 
  At the time that the proposed rule was issued, the leading case interpreting 
  the breadth of the statute was <em>United States v. Greber</em><u>,</u> 760 
  F.2d 68 (3d Cir.) <em>cert. denied</em>, 474 U.S. 988 (1985). Since publication 
  of the notice of proposed rulemaking on January 23, 1989, two other circuit 
  courts have lent further support to a broad reading of the statute: <em>Bay 
  State Ambulance</em>, which was discussed above, and <em>United States v. Kats</em>, 
  871 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1989). 
<p><em>Kats</em> involved an arrangement between physician offices or clinics, 
  a phlebotomy service ("THC"), and a clinical diagnostic laboratory ("Tech-Lab"). 
  Under the arrangement, THC collected blood and urine samples from physician 
  offices and medical clinics, and forwarded these laboratory specimens to Tech- 
  Lab. Tech-Lab performed the laboratory tests and billed the respective insurance 
  programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Tech-Lab kicked back 50 percent of 
  its proceeds to THC, which in turn kicked back part of its proceeds to the various 
  physician offices and clinics, including a clinic owned by Yan Kats. Kats and 
  others were prosecuted and convicted under the statute. 
<p>In upholding Kats's conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the 
  Ninth Circuit became the first court specifically to adopt the holding in <em>Gerber</em> 
  that "if one purpose of the payment is to induce future referrals, the [M]edicare 
  statute has been violated." 760 F.2d at 69. The <em>Kats</em> court held that 
  the statute is violated unless the payments are "wholly and not incidentally 
  attributable to the delivery of goods or services." <em>Id</em>. 871 F.2d at 
  108. The court upheld a jury instruction that read, in part, "It is not a defense 
  that there might have been other reasons for the solicitation of a remuneration 
  by the defendants, if you find that one of the material purposes for the solicitation 
  was to obtain money for the referral of services." <em>Id.</em> 871 F.2d at 
  108, n.1. 
<p>Because the statute is broad, the payment practices described in these safe 
  harbor provisions would be prohibited by the statute but for their inclusion 
  here. In mandating this regulation, Congress directed us to limit the reach 
  of the statute somewhat by permitting certain non-abusive arrangements, while 
  encouraging beneficial or innocuous arrangements. We believe that we have accomplished 
  this task in a manner that will not restrict our ability to prosecute, either 
  criminally or civilly, abusive schemes that violate the statute. However, these 
  safe harbor provisions do not constitute a guarantee that a health care provider 
  whose practice conforms to a particular safe harbor will not engage in abusive 
  practices. For this reason, we intend to monitor business arrangements that 
  comply with the terms of these safe harbor provisions, particularly investment 
  interests (see section III.C.1.b.ii. below), to determine whether abusive arrangements 
  exist within the parameter of a particular safe harbor. If abusive arrangements 
  are found to exist, we will entirely withdraw or modify any provision as appropriate. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>Comment: A small number of commenters requested clarification as to whether 
  the statute prohibits remuneration in return for referrals or other arrangements 
  to induce services or items reimbursed under Medicare alone, or whether the 
  conduct prohibited by the statute includes referrals or other arrangements to 
  induce services or items reimbursed by Medicaid and other State health care 
  programs. 
<p>Response: We agree that clarification is needed, and have amended the final 
  rule to make clear that the statute, and hence these safe harbor provisions, 
  apply to items or services which may be paid in whole or in part under Medicare 
  or a federally funded State health care program, such as Medicaid. However, 
  because commenters have expressed particular concern about the applicability 
  of these provisions to items and services payable under the Medicare and Medicaid 
  programs, our discussion of comments and responses often refer solely to these 
  two programs. 
<p>B. Comments on Areas That the OIG Invited Comments 
<p>In this section, we discuss four issues on which we specifically invited public 
  comments: continuing guidance, notice to beneficiaries, preferred provider organizations 
  (PPOs), and waiver of coinsurance and deductible amounts for inpatient hospital 
  care. We also requested comments on suggested standards for two additional investment 
  interest provisions that would protect investors, such as limited and general 
  partners, investing in small entities. Our discussion of those comments and 
  our responses are contained in the provision- by-provision analysis of<strong> 
  </strong>investment interests (see section III.C.1. below). 
<p>1. Continuing Guidance 
<p>Comment: We received a large number of responses to our invitation for comments 
  on how the OIG can best inform health care providers about fraudulent practices, 
  and can best ensure that the safe harbor regulation remains current as new health 
  care business practices develop. Many of these commenters suggested that the 
  Department issue advisory opinions about the legality of proposed business arrangements 
  under the statute. Some commenters requested that the Department implement a 
  mechanism for informing health care providers about business practices that 
  raise problems under the statute. 
<p>Proponents of advisory opinions argued that such a mechanism would provide 
  guidance concerning activities unaddressed by the safe harbor regulation, curb 
  illegal payment practices, and keep the Department informed of industry developments. 
  These commenters asserted that the Department has authority to issue advisory 
  opinions pursuant to its general statutory authority to promulgate regulations, 
  and pursuant to the specific authority under Public Law 100-93 to promulgate 
  this regulation. The commenters contended that advisory opinion rulings would 
  not hamper the Department of Justice's prosecutorial discretion under the statute, 
  because the immunizing effects of advice given would be limited to the facts 
  disclosed. The commenters also claimed that several other agencies employ advisory 
  opinion procedures in administering laws under their respective jurisdictions. 
<p>Response: We understand and appreciate providers' desire for legal security 
  in their business relations. Consistent with our mandate under Public Law 100-93, 
  we will continue to make efforts to inform health care providers about business 
  practices that may subject them to criminal prosecution or program exclusion. 
<p>We have concluded that we will not provide a mechanism responding to individual 
  requests for advisory opinions about the legality of a particular business arrangement 
  under the statute. The statute is primarily a criminal statute, and the Department 
  of Justice is vested with exclusive authority to enforce all criminal laws of 
  the United States. See sections 516, 519 and 547 of title 28 of the United States 
  Code. A plethora of case law holds that this exclusive authority extends to 
  all decisions to initiate, or to decline to initiate, criminal prosecutions. 
  See <em>Smith v. United States</em>, 375 F.2d 243, 247 (4th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. 
  denied</em> 389 U.S. 841; <em>Powell v. Katzenbach</em>, 359 F.2d 234 (D.C. 
  Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied</em> 384 U.S. 906; <em>United States v. Wong Kim 
  Bo</em>, 466 F.2d 1298 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Kysar</em>, 459 
  F. 2d 422 (10th Cir. 1972). For these reasons, this Department cannot, through 
  advisory opinions, immunize health care providers from criminal prosecution 
  under the statute. 
<p>The general or specific statutory authorizations cited by commenters do not 
  supersede the case law cited above. The Department's general authority as an 
  executive agency to promulgate regulations governing conduct within the Department's 
  jurisdiction does not, implicitly or explicitly, include authority to make judgments 
  that are within the exclusive domain of another agency. Neither does our mandate, 
  under Public Law 100-93, to promulgate this regulation provide such authority. 
  Our charge to immunize, by regulation, conduct and arrangements potentially 
  falling under the statute does not include judging whether the conduct of particular 
  individuals violates the statute. 
<p>Aside from these legal impediments, it is impossible as a practical matter 
  to give meaningful advice with respect to liability under the statute in the 
  context of a letter ruling. The statute requires proof of a knowing and willful 
  intent to induce or arrange for referrals or for other business reimbursable 
  under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Bay 
  State Ambulance and Hospital Rental Service, Inc</em>., <em>supra</em>, 874 
  F.2d at 29 ("The gravamen of Medicare Fraud is inducement"); <em>United States 
  v. Greber</em>, 760 F. 2d 68 at 71 ("The statute is aimed at the inducement 
  factor"). Thus, the extent to which conduct is motivated by inducing or arranging 
  for referrals will, in large part, determine liability under the statute. The 
  types of factual summaries that typically accompany requests for advisory opinions--descriptions 
  of proposed management contracts or lease agreements, or prospectuses of joint 
  ventures--are likely, however, to be insufficient for purposes of understanding 
  the motives of the parties. 
<p>In our experience, assessing whether parties to a particular scheme intend 
  to induce referrals requires substantial investigation resources. Requests for 
  advice typically do not furnish complete and objective accounts of all the facts 
  necessary to determine the subjective intent of the parties. In addition, requests 
  for advice involving business arrangements not yet consummated are especially 
  difficult to analyze because the motives of the parties to induce referrals 
  often become apparent only when the arrangement is operational. 
<p>Furthermore, we do not believe that an advisory opinion process is a necessary 
  or appropriate mechanism for keeping the Department aware of new developments 
  in industry business practices, and ensuring that the regulation remains current. 
  As we have discussed above, the legislative history of Public Law 100-93 clearly 
  directs the Secretary to "formally re-evaluate the anti-kickback regulations 
  on a periodic basis and, in so doing, * * * solicit public comment at the outset 
  of the review process." H.R. Rep. No. 85, <em>supra</em>, at 27. We believe 
  that periodic updating of this regulation, with the opportunity for public input, 
  is the best way to ensure that these regulations remain practical and relevant 
  in the face of changes in health care delivery and payment arrangements. The 
  need to clarify, interpret, fine tune, expand, or otherwise alter this regulation 
  in response to public and industry input will provide an occasion for us to 
  respond to unanticipated, newly developing, or other beneficial arrangements. 
<p>Despite commenters' arguments that other Federal agencies offer the public 
  mechanisms for obtaining advisory opinions, only one other agency of which we 
  are aware, the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), provides any advice with 
  respect to a statutory provision that prohibits "knowing and willful" conduct. 
  The FEC issues such advice under specific statutory authority (2 U.S.C. 437d(a)(7)). 
  It is our understanding, however, that the FEC's advisory opinions do not inquire 
  into whether any conduct is knowing and willful. Thus, the FEC's practice follows 
  the general rule that agencies will refrain from rendering prospective advice 
  on issues of intent. For example, the IRS has stated that it will not issue 
  advice as to the "due diligence" or "good-faith" of parties. See Rev. Proc. 
  88-3, 1988-1 IRB 29. 
<p>As an alternative, we believe that OIG fraud alerts are the best mechanism 
  for imparting practical and continuing guidance to individuals and entities 
  seeking to avoid violations of the statute. The fraud alert program, implemented 
  in March of 1984, was designed to increase our effectiveness in preventing fraud 
  in this Department's programs by highlighting conduct likely to be illegal. 
  Since 1984, we have issued over 100 fraud alerts on subjects unrelated to the 
  anti-kickback statute. On April 24, 1989, we initiated distribution of a Special 
  Fraud Alert on Joint Venture Arrangements to all individuals and entities participating 
  in Medicare, which gave examples of specific characteristics of provider-owned 
  entities that, in our view, might result in abusive or unlawful business arrangements. 
  By identifying what we consider to be suspect features of limited partnerships 
  and other joint ventures (including potentially abusive practices for selecting 
  and retaining investors, for structuring the legal entity or entities involved, 
  and for distributing profits), the Special Fraud Alert communicated our views 
  about the legitimacy of potential or existing ownership arrangements. We believe 
  that fraud alerts can be equally as educational about other areas of enforcement 
  of the statute, and plan to distribute similar information as the need arises. 
<p>Comment: A few commenters inquired about the binding effect of advisory letters 
  written by HCFA in the 1970s, when that agency was responsible for enforcing 
  the statute. The commenters suggested that these letters may serve to protect 
  health care providers who engage in a particular business arrangement that was 
  approved by HCFA at that time even though the OIG has not now proposed a safe 
  harbor for that arrangement. 
<p>Response: No person in the Department or with the fiscal intermediaries or 
  carriers is, or ever has been, authorized to permit a practice that the statute 
  makes illegal. The Department's lack of authority to provide legal advice on 
  the application of the statute to specific factual situations has been consistently 
  communicated to the public for years. Consequently, no person may reasonably 
  rely on any such advice, especially when that advice is a letter written to 
  a third party about a business arrangement different from the one in which the 
  party is engaging. In sum, the so-called advisory letters may not be regarded 
  in any way as authoritative. 
<p>The only authority to legalize conduct is this safe harbor regulation. This 
  regulation supersedes any prior communications from the Department regarding 
  business practices considered not subject to prosecution, and is the only formal 
  mechanism to set forth business arrangements or payment practices that will 
  not be prosecuted under the statute. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters requested the OIG to issue selective opinions on issues 
  affecting a class of providers that arise under the statute and safe harbor 
  regulations, even if we decline to provide advice about specific business arrangements 
  or activities. 
<p>Response: As we have said, we plan to provide guidance on generic issues through 
  fraud alerts distributed to the provider community. In addition, we remain open 
  to examining the usefulness of other mechanisms for informing the public and 
  health care provider groups about the types of new business arrangements to 
  which the OIG will give investigative priority. 
<p>2. Notice to Beneficiaries 
<p>Comment: Commenters overwhelmingly supported requiring health care providers 
  to disclose to patients any financial relationships with sources of referral. 
  They argued that such disclosure would not be burdensome, and that many codes 
  of professional ethics, as well as many state statutes, already mandate such 
  disclosure. 
<p>Response: With one exception, we have decided not to require such disclosure 
  to qualify under a particular safe harbor provision. First, the activities covered 
  under each safe harbor provision are by definition activities that we deem have 
  a low potential for abuse. Second, disclosure in and of itself would not provide 
  a significant additional assurance that abuse would not occur, even though disclosure 
  may reduce the potential for abuse somewhat by increasing consumer awareness 
  of the relationship between health care providers. Finally, it is possible for 
  a health care provider to cast a disclosure to fit that provider's promotional 
  objective, which is exactly the opposite result from that which we would want 
  to achieve. 
<p>The one provision in which we condition safe harbor protection on disclosure 
  is that of referral services. Referral services help beneficiaries make their 
  initial contact with the health care system before a relationship of trust is 
  established with a particular health care provider. Without disclosure of the 
  manner in which a provider of services was selected or rejected by a referral 
  service and the relationship between the service and health care providers, 
  a consumer has very little information upon which to base his or her trust in 
  the practitioner to whom the consumer is being referred. For example, a consumer 
  may well decide to put more trust in a surgeon referred by the referral service 
  if the consumer knew that the referral service only uses board certified physicians. 
  On the other hand, a consumer may feel less confidence in a referral if any 
  physician, no matter what his or her disciplinary record, were one of the referral 
  service's members. Consequently, we are confident that, in this instance, disclosure 
  represents a meaningful added protection. 
<p>Although we are not requiring disclosure of financial interests under the other 
  safe harbor provisions, we consider disclosure of financial interests in entities 
  to which health care providers refer patients an ethical duty (See, for example, 
  rule 8.03 of the Current Opinions of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 
  of the American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill. 1989). Also, to the extent 
  that disclosure affects a patient's freedom of choice and quality of care, it 
  may be necessary to enable a patient to give informed consent. 
<p>3. Health Maintenance Organizations, Preferred Provider Organizations and Other 
  Managed Care Plans 
<p>We received a number of responses to our invitation to comment on how to protect 
  health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), 
  and other managed care plans. In addition, we received many other comments regarding 
  HMOs that waive coinsurance and deductible amounts, and price reduction agreements 
  negotiated by these and other types of health benefit plans. We are including 
  these comments in this section. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters requested safe harbor protection for HMOs that waive 
  the beneficiary's obligation to pay coinsurance and deductible amounts. They 
  believed that this was a common practice among HMOs. In addition, a few commenters 
  pointed out that some PPOs negotiate agreements with contract health care providers 
  for those providers not to charge the health plan or enrollee for some or all 
  of the coinsurance and deductible amounts they are owed for furnishing services 
  to enrollees. Under such an agreement, when the contract provider bills the 
  Medicare program directly (and not the health plan) and agrees to waive all 
  coinsurance and deductibles, the commenters typically phrased the agreement 
  as one "to accept Medicare payment as payment in full." One commenter specifically 
  objected to this practice. 
<p>Response: We agree that protection should be given to prepaid plans with contracts 
  and agreements with HCFA and State agencies for waiver of beneficiary obligations 
  to pay coinsurance and deductible amounts. However, as will be discussed below, 
  we do not agree that such protection is warranted at this time for PPOs and 
  prepaid plans that do not have contracts or agreements with HCFA or State agencies. 
<p>Health plans offer a variety of incentives to attract beneficiaries to become 
  enrollees. In many instances, HCFA permits such HMOs and competitive medical 
  plans (CMPs) to waive the premiums attributable to the coinsurance and deductible 
  amounts. Further, HMOs and CMPs under a risk contract with HCFA are required 
  under certain circumstances to reduce coinsurance and deductible amounts or 
  offer additional benefit options. 
<p>The routine waiver by a prepaid health plan of beneficiaries' obligation to 
  pay coinsurance and deductible amounts is clearly distinguishable from such 
  routine waiver by other health care providers, such as hospital outpatient departments, 
  physicians, or durable medical equipment suppliers. Two principal characteristics 
  distinguish a health plan's routine waiver of cost-sharing amounts from that 
  of other health care providers. First, a health plan's routine waiver program 
  is inextricably intertwined with the offering of a comprehensive package of 
  covered benefits, and is not offered for the purchase of an individual item 
  or service. Quite often, in the case of prepaid plans, the routine waiver of 
  cost-sharing amounts is made in the form of a reduction or waiver of the beneficiary's 
  premium and may also be combined with the offering of increased covered benefits. 
  Thus, the routine waiver of cost- sharing amounts is generally not an incentive 
  to use a particular item or service at the time it is furnished. 
<p>Second, although cost-sharing requirements can serve to control utilization, 
  HMOs and other health plans under contract with HCFA or a State agency have 
  built-in incentives to control unnecessary utilization, or have their utilization 
  and costs monitored by HCFA or the State agency. Thus, the issue of potential 
  overutilization (with increased costs to the programs) is adequately dealt with 
  without resort to imposing the obligation on beneficiaries to pay coinsurance 
  and deductible amounts. 
<p>Therefore, we expect to publish at a later date an additional safe harbor provision 
  to protect prepaid health plans that have a contract or agreement with HCFA 
  or a State agency where the health plan offers beneficiaries increased benefits 
  coverage, reduced cost-sharing amounts (coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments), 
  or reduced premiums where certain standards are met. Because of the limited 
  scope of the comments we received on HMOs, PPOs and managed care plans, we expect 
  to publish at a later date an interim final rule in order to solicit additional 
  comments from the public on this new safe harbor provision. 
<p>This new safe harbor provision will not protect incentives offered to beneficiaries 
  by health plans, such as PPOs, that are not operating under a contract or agreement 
  with HCFA or a State agency. Unlike health plans with such contracts or agreements, 
  we are not confident that all PPOs that engage in these negotiated waiver agreements 
  properly protect the Medicare and Medicaid programs against overutilization. 
  And we did not receive sufficient comments on the different types of PPOs for 
  us to distinguish the characteristics of a PPO engaging in these negotiated 
  waiver agreements where the Medicare and Medicaid programs are properly protected. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters requested the OIG to protect a variety of arrangements 
  between HMOs, PPOs, competitive medical plans (CMPs), managed care plans, and 
  other health plans on the one hand, and medical groups and other health care 
  providers who furnish items and services to the health plans at a reduced price 
  on the other hand. A few of these commenters observed the benefits that can 
  be achieved when a health care provider offers discounts to these organizations. 
  Several commenters recommended special treatment for relationships between HMOs 
  and health care providers, such as physicians and hospitals, involving the leasing 
  of space and equipment and contracting for personal services. One commenter 
  requested special safe harbor protection for "[a]ll transactions between an 
  HMO and contracting medical groups * * * if the medical group provides over 
  90 percent of its services to HMO members." 
<p>Response: We agree that there is a need to provide safe harbor protection for 
  certain practices between managed care plans and health care providers. Thus, 
  we are expecting to publish a rule that will protect many of these price reduction 
  arrangements where certain standards are met. For the same reasons as stated 
  above, we are expecting to publish this safe harbor provision as an interim 
  final rule with an opportunity for additional comments from the public. 
<p>The safe harbor provision we are expecting to publish will only protect agreements 
  between health plans and contract health care providers for the sole purpose 
  of furnishing items and services covered by the health plan, Medicare, or Medicaid. 
  In other words, for the reasons explained below, we are not protecting in this 
  provision the contracts between health plans and contract health care providers 
  for these providers to furnish services other than covered benefits, such as 
  peer review and management services. 
<p>As with all safe harbor provisions, where two parties engage in a multi- faceted 
  payment arrangement where protection is sought from more than one safe harbor, 
  we expect separate justifications to be clearly set forth for each provision 
  for which protection is sought. Where HMOs contract with physicians and other 
  health care providers for the furnishing of services other than covered health 
  care services, we believe that HMOs, PPOs and other prepaid health plans will 
  be able to conform their arrangements to the appropriate safe harbor provisions. 
  For example, many contract health care providers furnish peer review, marketing 
  services, or pre-enrollment screening for HMOs. For the remuneration attributable 
  to the furnishing of such services to be protected, it must comply with the 
  personal service/management contracts safe harbor provision. Also for example, 
  the remuneration attributable to the lease of space or equipment must comply 
  with those respective safe harbor provisions. 
<p>We are not convinced that merely because a medical group has a large majority 
  of its business with an HMO that a special across-the-board exemption for all 
  transactions is warranted. HMOs operate under a variety of payment mechanisms, 
  both with respect to the Medicare and Medicaid payments they receive and the 
  payments they make to physicians. Although in many cases the incentive structure 
  in which HMOs operate is designed to protect against overutilization of service, 
  this incentive structure may not extend to fee-for-service arrangements. 
<p>Further, even though many HMOs have generally operated largely free of fraud 
  and abuse problems, we are aware of some HMOs that have abused their contractual 
  relationships with medical groups, where individuals in the groups have engaged 
  in abusive activities on behalf of the HMO, or where the medical group has compromised 
  the interest of beneficiaries in order to keep the vital HMO contract. In at 
  least one case, a criminal conviction was obtained for such a practice. Although 
  safe harbor protection is warranted for certain contractual relationships between 
  health plans and contract health care providers, we also intend to use our authorities 
  aggressively to monitor closely and, where appropriate, penalize<strong> </strong>any 
  abusive relationships between these parties to assure that medically necessary 
  services of a high quality are available and accessible to all enrollees. 
<p>4. Waiver of Beneficiary Deductible and Coinsurance Amounts 
<p>Comment: The OIG received numerous comments on the establishment of a safe 
  harbor for waiver of hospital inpatient coinsurance and deductible (copayment) 
  amounts owed by program beneficiaries. Many commenters requested the OIG to 
  provide safe harbor protection for routine hospital waiver or partial reduction 
  of inpatient fees not subsequently claimed as bad debts because the practice 
  would benefit hospital inpatients without increasing program costs. Some commenters 
  urged the OIG to protect the submission of bad debt claims where copayments 
  were routinely waived for limited categories of patients, such as seniors. On 
  the other hand, several commenters were concerned that permitting hospital waiver 
  of inpatient copayments would encourage overutilization of hospital services 
  and promote cost-shifting to patients with nongovernmental insurance policies. 
<p>Response: Since October 1, 1983, when the prospective payment system (PPS) 
  for reimbursing hospital inpatient services was implemented, we have been aware 
  of hospitals that routinely waive Medicare beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance 
  charges for inpatient hospital services in order to attract patients. Because 
  the waiver of patient charges constitutes an inducement to use services in exchange 
  for something of value (the forgiveness of financial obligation), this practice 
  violates the statute. However, assuming the waived amounts are not later claimed 
  as bad debt, the practice appears to cause no direct financial harm to the Medicare 
  program because hospitals receive a pre-determined payment amount under PPS 
  regardless of their costs or charges. Moreover, due to hospital peer review 
  requirements and the relatively fixed level of patient demand for hospital inpatient 
  services, waiver of inpatient beneficiary fees is not likely to increase utilization 
  significantly. Furthermore, if hospital waiver policies do not discriminate 
  on the basis of length of stay or type of disease, the potential for program 
  abuse appears minimal. 
<p>In addition, we know of no data, nor have commenters produced or referred us 
  to any, indicating that routine hospital waivers of inpatient copayments owed 
  by program beneficiaries will shift the costs of care to non-Medicare patients. 
  Rather, we assume that most hospitals that choose to waive these amounts do 
  so because the hospital more than makes up in increased volume for any initial 
  "loss" resulting from not collecting the full amount to which it is entitled. 
  Although we believe there is little risk of "cost-shifting" to the non-Medicare 
  population, the first standard in this provision makes clear that any such cost-shifting 
  is not protected. 
<p>We do not agree, however, that health care providers who choose to waive copayment 
  amounts routinely for some or all of their patients should be permitted to claim 
  such amounts as bad debt. Such a rule would muddle two very distinct Medicare 
  policies. Traditionally, Medicare health care providers are reimbursed for uncollectible 
  payments owed by beneficiaries. See 42 CFR 413.80. This rule requires, among 
  other things, that health care providers make an indigence determination on 
  a case-by-case basis, or reasonable collection efforts, prior to recouping bad 
  debt losses from the program. See also Provider Reimbursement Manual, sections 
  310, 312, HCFA Pub. No. 15-1. Thus, payment of Medicare bad debts, unlike routine 
  waivers of Medicare cost sharing amounts protected under this safe harbor regulation, 
  are only authorized under certain conditions pertaining to the uncollectability 
  of payments and the indigence of beneficiaries. Health care providers who routinely 
  waive beneficiary copayments in accordance with this safe harbor regulation, 
  and do not make case-by-case indigence determinations or otherwise prove uncollectability 
  under 42 CFR 413.80, cannot deduct expenses as bad debt. Where such an unlawful 
  expense is claimed, the hospital may be subject to civil or criminal prosecution. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters requested the OIG to extend safe harbor protection 
  to waiver of patient fees imposed for a wide array of provider services. Several 
  commenters sought protection for waiver of beneficiary copayments for part A 
  services furnished by other cost-based health care providers, such as skilled 
  nursing facilities and home health agencies. These commenters argued that where 
  services are paid on a reasonable cost basis, just as where services are reimbursed 
  under PPS, waiver of beneficiary copayments causes no financial harm to the 
  program. Other commenters sought still broader protection under the safe harbor 
  for copayments for services under part B, arguing that the limited protection 
  granted for inpatient hospital copayments was discriminatory. 
<p>Response: We believe that protection is uniquely appropriate for waiver of 
  patient charges related to hospital inpatient services. A routine waiver program 
  will not likely increase patient demand for these services, since beneficiaries 
  cannot admit themselves, and hospital overnight stays are inherently undesirable 
  from a patient's perspective. Thus, it is unlikely that a routine waiver program 
  will affect utilization. By contrast, cost-based fee- for-service health care 
  providers, such as home health agencies and nursing homes, may be able to offset 
  their losses resulting from their waiver of copayments by increasing their Medicare 
  allowable costs. Such manipulation of reimbursement amounts would be virtually 
  impossible to prevent. Thus, we do not believe that the protection offered under 
  this safe harbor provision should be extended to routine waiver of beneficiary 
  copayments by cost-based fee-for- service health care providers. 
<p>Routine waiver of beneficiary copayments by individuals or entities reimbursed 
  on the basis of reasonable charges even more clearly affects program costs. 
  When charge-based health care providers routinely fail to collect all or part 
  of beneficiary copayments authorized by law, and then submit actual charges 
  to Medicare as if copayment amounts were collected, these charges increase customary 
  and prevailing rates which, in turn, inflate program costs. The Medicare Carriers 
  Manual makes clear that in these situations, a health care provider is required 
  to reduce his or her actual charge. See section 5220, HCFA Pub. No. 14. Thus, 
  we believe that individuals and entities who fail to reduce actual charges submitted 
  to Medicare are misrepresenting their charges, and may be subject to civil and 
  criminal liability for submitting false claims. 
<p>We are aware that some local government health care providers, including county 
  hospital outpatient departments, routinely reduce beneficiary payments at the 
  time of service for the extremely indigent populations they serve. For these 
  health care providers, offering patients the option of reduced payment at time 
  of service may be a more successful collection strategy than subsequently billing 
  patients for the entire copayment. This practice, while not protected by this 
  safe harbor regulation, would not likely violate the statute so long as the 
  partial forgiveness of the copayment obligation was strictly a pragmatic financial 
  decision and not an inducement to patients to purchase medical services. We 
  see no purpose in interfering in the mission of local governments or other hospitals 
  that serve primarily indigent populations when they reduce beneficiary fees 
  for those unable to pay. Such health care providers, typically, have no need 
  to engage in sophisticated marketing strategies to induce more business. 
<p>Comment: One commenter advised the OIG that in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 254b(f)(3)(F) 
  and 254c(e)(3)(F), federally qualified migrant and community health care centers 
  are required to develop a sliding fee schedule for patients based upon ability 
  to pay, which could result in waiver of part or all of the Medicare coinsurance 
  and deductible amounts. These commenters argued that such waivers, although 
  mandated under Public Health Service Act grant programs, could be deemed a violation 
  of the statute. 
<p>Response: In section 4161(a)(4) of Public Law 101-508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
  Act of 1990, Congress enacted a fourth statutory exception to the statute, which 
  exempts a waiver of any Medicare Part B coinsurance by a Federally qualified 
  health care center to any individual who qualifies for subsidized services under 
  the Public Health Services Act. Thus, we are providing a safe harbor provision 
  for this exception. In addition, we are making this safe harbor applicable to 
  similarly situated individuals who receive services under the Maternal and Child 
  Health Service Block Grant program (see section 505(2)(D) of the Act; 42 U.S.C. 
  705(2)(D), or who are Medicaid beneficiaries. 
<p>Comment: Six commenters argued that protecting routine waiver of beneficiary 
  payments for inpatient hospital services would discourage competition from ambulatory 
  surgical centers (ASCs). 
<p>Response: Although the granting of safe harbor protection for the waiver of 
  inpatient copayments gives practitioners or their patients an incentive to choose 
  inpatient hospital settings over outpatient settings, we believe that the activities 
  of the PROs reasonably ensure that services are furnished in outpatient settings 
  where appropriate. Therefore, we believe that the granting of safe harbor protection 
  only for inpatient services is unlikely to draw patients away from ASCs and 
  other outpatient settings. 
<p>Comment: A few commenters requested the OIG to protect waiver or discounts 
  of inpatient copayments where hospitals and physicians offer this benefit not 
  to patients directly, but to insurance companies, HMOs, or employer or union 
  medical service plans, that have assumed liability for the beneficiary portion 
  of payment under the terms of their insurance policies. Insurers offering these 
  insurance benefits may attempt to negotiate with hospitals to reduce or eliminate 
  the beneficiary portion of reimbursement in exchange for endorsing the hospital 
  as a preferred provider or offering other tangible benefits. 
<p>Response: This safe harbor provision protects the waiver by hospitals of inpatient 
  copayment amounts only where these amounts would otherwise be paid by Medicare 
  beneficiaries themselves. In paragraph (k)(1)(iii), we have expressly made this 
  provision inapplicable to negotiated price reduction agreements between health 
  care providers and third-party payers, even where the reduction involves beneficiary 
  copayments for which the third party payor has assumed liability as part of 
  a Medigap policy. As we discussed in the section immediately above, we are expecting 
  to publish an additional safe harbor provision to protect HMOs, CMPs and HCPPs 
  under contract with HCFA or a State agency that waive coinsurance and deductible 
  amounts owed by beneficiaries where certain standards are met. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters sought protection for the waiver of patient copayment 
  amounts for the first eight days of care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) 
  after discharge from a hospital under the same ownership. These commenters stated 
  that protection was needed to enable the smooth transfer of patients who were 
  ill, and to allow hospital beds to be vacated for sicker patients. 
<p>Response: We understand that health care providers operating both hospitals 
  and SNFs may, for entirely legitimate reasons, wish to continue waiving SNF 
  copayment amounts when transferring hospital patients into the SNF for a brief 
  period. In section III.D. below, we discuss in more detail the special considerations 
  that exist where the hospital and SNF are wholly owned by a single "parent" 
  entity, or where one of the facilities is the sole owner of the other. <br>
  <br>
<p>Comment: One commenter requested the OIG to expand the safe harbor provision 
  for waiver of hospital inpatient copayments to cover the provision of free items 
  or services such as meals or presurgical overnight stays, samples of products 
  from manufacturers, or blood screening and other testing services. The commenter 
  suggested that such free gifts benefit patients without causing harm to the 
  program, so long as there is no obligation to purchase additional items or services 
  upon receipt of the free gifts. 
<p>Response: We decline to protect the offer of free gifts to beneficiaries within 
  this safe harbor provision, as we have declined to protect this practice within 
  the safe harbor provision governing discounts. The statute clearly contemplates 
  that illicit remuneration may involve payments "in cash or in kind." The practice 
  of offering free gifts may well induce beneficiaries to purchase additional 
  or unnecessary items or services. Such inducements could easily become excessive, 
  and there is no distinct financial or other cut-off point below which we could 
  be sure that gifts remained non-abusive. Because we understand that such inducements 
  are an area of significant abuse, we believe that protection of this practice 
  would be unwarranted. 
<p>C. Provision-by-Provision Analysis of Safe Harbors 
<p>1. Investment Interests--s 1001.952(a) 
<p>The OIG received close to three hundred comments on the issue of providing 
  safe harbor protection for payments from investment interests. These comments 
  are divided into three broad categories: (a) Comments on the proposed safe harbor 
  provision for payments from investments in large publicly traded entities; (b) 
  suggestions for safe harbors for payments from investments in small entities 
  such as limited partnerships, about which we solicited comments, and (c) proposals 
  for protecting payments from other investment interests. For convenience, we 
  are discussing all of these comments in this section. Before discussing the 
  comments and responses for these three broad categories of investment interests, 
  we will discuss general issues raised with respect to investment interests. 
<p>Comment: We received a number of comments asking the OIG to clarify the types 
  of investors and investment interests to be protected. In particular, we received 
  many comments urging the OIG to protect indirect investment interests held by 
  family members and to protect debt as well as equity investments. 
<p>Response: We are adding a definition of the terms "investor" and "investment 
  interests" to this safe harbor provision. We are defining an "investor" to include 
  both individuals and entities who either directly or indirectly hold an investment 
  interest in an entity. Our definition includes examples, which are not intended 
  to be an exhaustive list, of ways that investment interests may be indirectly 
  held. For example, a family member of a referring physician may hold the investment 
  interest in the joint venture entity, or a referring physician may have a legal 
  or beneficial interest in an entity, such as his or her group practice, a trust 
  or a holding company, where that entity directly holds the investment interest 
  in the joint venture entity. In both cases, we view the physician as having 
  the ownership interest in the joint venture entity. 
<p>In many cases we distinguish investors who do business with the entity in which 
  they have invested from other investors who are exclusively seeking a return 
  on their investment. We call an investor who does business with the entity as 
  "an investor who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish 
  items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity." This classification 
  is meant to include all investors who do business in any manner with the entity. 
  Except as noted below, we do not limit this category to investors who actually 
  make referrals. Rather, our focus is on the status of the investor and the ability 
  to make or influence the referral stream or level of business activity for the 
  entity. Such investors include not only physicians, but hospitals and other 
  entities capable of influencing referrals. 
<p>We note that this category of investor doing business with the entity also 
  includes those investors who furnish items and services to the entity as well 
  as those investors who otherwise generate business for the entity. Thus for 
  example, if a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier and hospital both enter 
  into a joint venture to furnish DME to patients when they leave the hospital, 
  both the DME supplier and the hospital fit within this category of investor 
  doing business with the entity. 
<p>There are some very limited situations where, because of the special status 
  or location of the investor, he or she does not fit within this category of 
  investor doing business with the entity. For example, for the most part, retired 
  physicians no longer make or influence referrals. In addition, typically a physician 
  who resides and practices in a separate service area from the entity is similarly 
  not "in a position to make or influence referrals." Or an investor could simply 
  make an agreement barring him or her from actually making or influencing referrals 
  to the entity. In all three examples, the determination whether an investor 
  should be classified as doing business with the entity in which he or she has 
  invested is a factual question. However, we will accept a written stipulation 
  that for the life of the investment the investor will not make referrals to, 
  furnish items or services for, or otherwise generate business for the entity. 
  We emphasize that, because of the potential for abuse of this stipulation agreement, 
  the investor must be bound to this agreement for the life of the investment 
  as long as he or she remains an investor. 
<p>Finally, our definition of the term "investment interest" makes clear that 
  debt as well as equity investments are protected. 
<p>a. Large Publicly Traded Entities. Comment: Several commenters questioned the 
  relationship of this proposed safe harbor provision to the rules of the Securities 
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of securities. For example, 
  some suggested that the OIG should exempt all investment interests that are 
  traded on a publicly regulated exchange, while another suggested that public 
  trading be an additional condition for protection. In addition, a variety of 
  comments were received regarding the standards adopted from the SEC rules that, 
  in order for payments from investment interests in an entity to be protected, 
  the assets of the entity must exceed $5 million and the number of shareholders 
  must exceed 500 persons (the so-called "$5 million asset/500 investor rule"). 
  While some suggested the $5 million test was too high, one suggested that it 
  was too low. One commenter suggested that the 500 shareholder test was too high, 
  and another suggested that the OIG require either $5 million in assets or 500 
  shareholders, but not both. Finally, another commenter suggested that the OIG 
  protect an investment in an entity any time the asset level was greater than 
  $5 million. 
<p>Response: We intended to protect profit distributions made to referring investors 
  in large publicly traded corporations where the investment interest was obtained 
  at fair market value through trading on a publicly regulated exchange. The remuneration 
  received by these investors is so tangentially related to their referrals that 
  the potential for abuse is minimal. 
<p>As we stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, we adopted the SEC registration 
  rules from l5 U.S.C. 78l(g) and 17 CFR 240.12g-1, which generally require entities 
  with more than $5 million in assets and more than 500 investors to register 
  with the SEC. At the time, we had believed that such a test would protect payments 
  from only those entities that are actively traded on a national securities exchange. 
<p>Based on the comments we received and our experience in enforcing the statute, 
  we believe that in many respects the SEC rules are not applicable for the purposes 
  of protecting against abuse. In particular, the $5 million threshold is too 
  low. An entity that owns two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines may well 
  meet this test. Thus, we are changing the asset threshold level from $5 million 
  to $50 million. Publicly traded entities of this size are sufficiently large 
  to assure that abuse is minimal. 
<p>In addition, the SEC's other criteria of 500 investors does not provide meaningful 
  protection against abuse. We recognize that in many cases a large number of 
  investors can dilute the influence of one investor's referral patterns on the 
  level of payments that he or she receives. However, it has been our experience 
  that many sham joint ventures try to obtain many investors, each of whom contribute 
  nominal investments, as a mechanism to lock-in the loyalties of as many physicians 
  as possible. Thus, depending on the factual circumstances of a particular joint 
  venture, a large number of investors could either be abusive or minimize abuse. 
<p>We are making other revisions to this first investment interest safe harbor 
  provision to provide greater clarity consistent with our original intent. Thus, 
  this safe harbor as revised contains two definitional prerequisites in paragraph 
  (a)(1) for the type of entity we are protecting, and is followed by five standards, 
  all of which must be met to the extent they apply to the investment interest 
  in question. 
<p>For an entity to be protected under this safe harbor, it must meet two definitional 
  prerequisites. The first prerequisite to qualify for protection is that the 
  assets of the entity must be measured any time within the previous fiscal year 
  or the previous 12 month period. This time period is different from the SEC 
  rule, which we believe to be overly restrictive for the purposes of this safe 
  harbor. The time period for measuring compliance which we are adopting will 
  mean for all practical purposes that growing entities will be protected as soon 
  as they reach compliance with all the preconditions and standards in this safe 
  harbor, rather than having to wait for the next fiscal year as the SEC requires. 
  In addition, the time period we are specifying permits an entity to retain safe 
  harbor protection for a limited time period even though it is no longer in compliance 
  with the $50 million asset threshold in this rule. During this time period, 
  an entity will have the opportunity to bring itself back into compliance. 
<p>The second definitional prerequisite is that the entity must possess $50 million 
  in the form of undepreciated net tangible assets. This clarification of what 
  we mean by $50 million in assets removes many assets which we never intended 
  to include within the scope of protection. We are excluding all intangible assets 
  such as the company's valuation of its name recognition and stock and other 
  forms of goodwill. We are excluding such assets because their valuation is too 
  subject to "creative" accounting or appraisal techniques. The assets must also 
  be reduced by any liabilities. Thus, a corporation only has $1 million of net 
  tangible assets when it buys a $5 million piece of equipment with a $4 million 
  loan. However, we are excluding from the calculation of assets any reductions 
  in the value of assets due to depreciation. We believe it is inappropriate for 
  an entity to lose safe harbor protection as a result of the aging of its assets. 
  Further, we do not want to create incentives to replace equipment unnecessarily 
  merely for the entity to regain safe harbor protection based on the value of 
  new equipment. We are also clarifying that the reporting of net tangible assets 
  must be based on net acquisition costs of purchasing such assets from an unrelated 
  entity. The use of net acquisition costs in this rule is a generally accepted 
  accounting principle, and makes clear that, for the purposes of this rule, we 
  will not accept a company's use of current market valuations of assets. Further, 
  we intend to use the Medicare related party rule, 42 CFR 413.17, to assure that 
  the acquisition costs from the purchase of an asset is only based on a bona 
  fide purchase through an arm's length transaction. Our final clarification in 
  how to apply the $50 million asset test is that assets unrelated to a company's 
  health care line of business cannot be used in the calculation of assets. For 
  example, a nursing home corporation could be a subsidiary of a hotel chain. 
  The hotel assets cannot be used for purposes of qualifying for the $50 million 
  asset test. However, with the exception of the related party rule, it is not 
  our intent to require corporations to be familiar with cost reimbursement rules 
  of 42 CFR part 413. Tangible assets used in furnishing items and services may 
  be counted even though they may not be allowable costs under part 413. The information 
  necessary to determine compliance with this $50 million asset test is readily 
  available in the accounting books of entities, and the accounting methods for 
  determining compliance are fully consistent with generally accepted accounting 
  principles. Thus, an independent certified public accountant should have little 
  trouble certifying an entity's compliance with these requirements. 
<p>This safe harbor contains five standards, not all of which may be applicable 
  in every instance. The first two standards, paragraphs (a)(1) (i)- (ii), which 
  will be discussed here, focus on the nature of the investment interest. (The 
  three remaining standards are being added in response to other comments which 
  will be discussed below.) 
<p>The first standard (see paragraph (a)(1)(i)) applies only to an investment 
  interest in an equity security, and requires such a security to be registered 
  with the SEC under 15 U.S.C. 78l (b) or (g). We had considered but are rejecting 
  an alternative standard that the investment interest must merely meet the SEC 
  registration qualifications. This requirement of actual registration provides 
  a clear bright-line rule, and is an indication of good-faith entry into the 
  public securities markets, which is a significant factor underlying the rationale 
  for this safe harbor. In addition, we are requiring the investment interest 
  actually to be registered with the SEC because many exemptions exist to the 
  SEC's $5 million asset/500 investor rule, which permit many entities to be actively 
  traded but not to be registered with the SEC, and thus not under its oversight. 
  See 15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(2). However, the SEC's reasons for granting an exception 
  may not be consistent with the purposes of this rule, and thus we see no particular 
  reason to protect securities simply because they qualify for an SEC exemption. 
  We note that one such exemption under 15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(2) is for securities 
  listed and registered on a national securities exchange. Such securities must 
  comply with 15 U.S.C. 78l(b), and for the purposes of this rule we are requiring 
  such securities to be registered with the SEC. 
<p>We are not applying the registration requirement to investment interests that 
  involve debt securities because we believe that the extra safeguard of SEC registration 
  is unnecessary. Publicly traded debt instruments, although protected under this 
  safe harbor, are not the type of investment interests that are the focal point 
  of this rule. Although the potential for abuse is present, we have not been 
  apprised of the actual occurrence of abuse relating to these investment interests, 
  and believe that their usefulness as instruments for inducing investors' referrals 
  is more limited than equity investment interests. 
<p>The second standard (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii)) responds to the commenters' 
  suggestions regarding public trading. We are adding a standard to this provision 
  requiring the investment interest of an investor in a position to make or influence 
  referrals to, furnish items and services to, or otherwise generate business 
  for the entity to be obtained on terms equally available to the public through 
  a registered national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange 
  or the American Stock Exchange, or through the National Association of Securities 
  Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system. We note that we specifically intend 
  to preclude safe harbor protection for securities traded through the so-called 
  "pink sheets" or those "non-NASDAQ" securities that are traded through the OTC 
  Bulletin Board Service. See, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-27975, May 
  1, 1990. This standard follows our original intent to assure that the investment 
  interests of physicians or others in a position to influence referrals must 
  be obtained through the kind of arms length trading that is normally associated 
  with actively traded public securities at the fair market value through a publicly 
  regulated exchange. Such public trading assures that the entity does not obtain 
  capital by self- selecting investors based on their status as sources of referrals. 
<p>Although we are not requiring investment interests of other investors to be 
  obtained through public trading, physicians and others in a position to influence 
  referrals must strictly comply with this standard. We plan to closely scrutinize 
  attempts to circumvent this standard. For example, any investment interest obtained 
  before an entity becomes publicly traded is not protected under this provision. 
  In addition, an investor is not protected by exchanging a limited partnership 
  interest for shares in a newly formed entity that is publicly traded. Further, 
  this standard precludes protection of payments from securities where physicians 
  are afforded the opportunity to buy the available shares of an entity before 
  other members of the public have the opportunity to invest in that entity. Such 
  an entity would have only physicians as investors, and it is not our intent 
  to protect payments from such entities. We expect the public to be afforded 
  a genuine opportunity to invest in these publicly traded entities. Where referring 
  sources (or their immediate families) hold a large proportion of the shares, 
  we will presume that this standard has not been met. 
<p>Comment: A number of commenters suggested that the OIG expand this provision 
  in a variety of ways to protect remuneration from debt as well as equity instruments 
  and from entities other than corporations, such as partnerships. <br>
  <br>
<p>Response: As discussed above, this safe harbor protects debt as well as equity 
  instruments. We recognize that an ambiguity existed in our proposed rule in 
  that our 500 investor test applied only to "a class of equity security" and 
  thus appeared to prohibit debt instruments from qualifying under this safe harbor 
  provision. However, this ambiguity is resolved by eliminating the 500 investor 
  test. In addition as discussed above, we are exempting debt instruments from 
  the SEC registration requirement contained in the first standard. 
<p>We also agree that investments in partnerships should be protected, and we 
  are revising this provision accordingly, by adding a definition of investment 
  interest. 
<p>Comment: A few commenters expressed concern that entities meeting the requirements 
  contained in the proposed safe harbor provision could still be engaging in abusive 
  relationships with individuals in a position to make referrals. One commenter 
  suggested that we specifically protect against fraudulent cross-referral arrangements 
  whereby investors in entity "A" are explicitly or implicitly encouraged to refer 
  to entity "B" in return for entity "A" receiving the referrals from the investors 
  of entity "B." 
<p>Response: We agree with the thrust of these comments, and are adding three 
  standards (see paragraphs (a)(1) (iii)-(v)) to clarify our original intent and 
  assure that investment interests are not used as inducements for referrals. 
  One, the entity or any investor must not market or furnish the entity's items 
  or services to passive investors in any manner differently than to non- investors. 
  In other words, although an entity may seek referrals or other business from 
  passive investors, it must promote and furnish its items or services to investors 
  and non-investors in the same manner. An entity may not use a separate marketing 
  approach or provide a different level of service to passive investors as opposed 
  to non-investors. For example, in its promotional efforts, the entity may not 
  in any manner appeal to or refer to such investor's position as an investor, 
  and in serving customers it may not offer special arrangements to investors 
  that are not available or are offered on different terms to non-investors. Any 
  distribution to passive investors of individual or aggregate investor referral 
  patterns would also not be protected under this provision. In addition, the 
  entity or any investor must not promote the items or services of other entities 
  as part of a cross referral agreement. One type of cross referral arrangement 
  we are not protecting is the sham transaction described in the above comment. 
<p>Two, the entity must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an investor 
  to use for the purpose of obtaining the investment interest. We do not believe 
  protection should be afforded where an investor is loaned money from the entity, 
  or from a parent or subsidiary corporation (or is guaranteed a loan by the entity 
  or a related organization), and the investor makes an investment based on that 
  loan. In such a situation, the investor is adding no real capital to the entity. 
  We note, however, that safe harbor protection is available where the investor 
  borrows from other sources, such as from his or her broker or a bank. 
<p>And three, the amount of payment in return for the investment interest must 
  be directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment. Such payments 
  are consistent with the type of corporate dividend payment that we are trying 
  to protect. 
<p>We believe that these minor revisions, which are fully consistent with our 
  original intent, should offer reasonable protection against the possibility 
  of significant abuses without unduly restricting the types of entities that 
  may qualify under this provision. 
<p>b. Small Entities. In the notice of proposed rulemaking we solicited comments 
  on expanding the proposed investment interest safe harbor to protect payments 
  from investments in small entities, particularly limited and general partnership 
  interests. For limited partnership interests we suggested four standards for 
  protection: (1) A bona fide opportunity to invest is made on an equal basis 
  without regard to the investor's ability to make referrals, (2) no requirement 
  is imposed on the investor to make referrals, (3) disclosure is made to the 
  referred patient, and (4) payments are not related to referrals. As conditions 
  for protection of payments from investments in general partnership interests, 
  we suggested that disclosure of the investment interest be made to a referred 
  patient and payments not be related to referrals. <br>
  <br>
<p>Comment: A large number of people commented that, in view of the OIG's interpretation 
  of the statute as not prohibiting all referrals to entities in which a physician 
  has an investment interest, safe harbor protection should be provided for legitimate 
  arrangements. While some commenters suggested that the OIG adopt generic criteria 
  for analyzing these arrangements, others commented more directly on the proposed 
  standards we suggested in the proposed rule. A few commenters suggested that 
  any safe harbor protections should treat indirect ownership interests held by 
  family members in the same manner as direct ownership interests to assure that 
  investors who make referrals to that entity do not circumvent the intent of 
  these requirements by having investments held in the name of family members 
  instead of their own names. 
<p>The enormous response to this invitation for comment reflected the polarization 
  of the health care community on this issue. Those supporting safe harbor protection 
  emphasized that physician-investor joint ventures promote competition, provide 
  quality services, promote patient convenience, bring needed services to communities, 
  are cost effective, do not lead to over- utilization, do not compromise ethics, 
  and enable services to be provided outside hospitals and physician offices. 
  Those urging no safe harbor protection or expressing a need for stringent safeguards 
  argued that these joint ventures hurt competition, compromise quality of care, 
  are not in patients' best interests, increase costs, lead to over-utilization, 
  and create conflict of interests between health care providers and patients. 
<p>A large number of commenters generally supported safe harbor protection for 
  payments to those with managing partnership interests and agreed with the OIG's 
  two suggested conditions for protection. However, a few commenters opposed such 
  protection. In addition, a few commenters suggested that the OIG define which 
  individuals would be protected under this provision. 
<p>Response: Because of the significant business investment activity in these 
  small entities--typically joint ventures--and the advantages of permitting them 
  in certain situations, we believe that safe harbor protection is warranted. 
  However, we have also observed widespread abuses in many of these joint ventures. 
  In particular, we believe that a large number of these newly formed entities 
  are designed to have physicians as investors specifically to induce them to 
  use the entity in which they have invested. Therefore, any safe harbor protection 
  must include significant safeguards to minimize any corrupting influence the 
  investment interest may have on the physician-investor's decision where to refer 
  a patient. We are including a second <strong>(35967)</strong> <strong> </strong>investment 
  interest provision (paragraph (a)(2)) that protects payments to investors who 
  are limited and general partners, shareholders, or holders of debt securities 
  where eight standards are met. We will discuss some of the definitional categories 
  of persons who are protected under this provision, our response to comments 
  recommending special protection for managing partnership interests, and our 
  three categories that provide structure for the eight standards in this safe 
  harbor. 
<p>We have classified "investors" as either "passive" or "active" because some 
  of the standards apply only to those defined as "passive" investors. The definition 
  of an "active" investor includes two categories of persons. The first category 
  is modeled after a bona fide general partner in a partnership under the Uniform 
  Partnership Act who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the entity. 
<p>We are including a second way to qualify as an "active" investor: the individual 
  or entity must agree in writing to undertake the liability for the partnership, 
  including the acts of its agents acting within the scope of their agency. We 
  believe that such an affirmative act will assure that the individual or entity 
  performs many of the same functions that general partners do who actively manage 
  the day-to-day operations of the joint venture entity. For example, these active 
  investors undertake the business risk that a typical general partner does, and 
  will be interested in assuring that the day-to-day managers of the entity engage 
  in sound business practices and not run afoul of the statute as well as other 
  Federal and State laws and regulations. 
<p>"Passive" investors are those investors who are not active investors, such 
  as limited partners in a partnership or shareholders in a corporation. <br>
  <br>
<p>This second investment interest safe harbor provision includes some standards 
  that must be met by both passive and active investors, and some standards that 
  need only be met by passive investors, to the extent any exist in the joint 
  venture. If an entity contains only active investors, the standards applicable 
  only to passive investors would, of course, not apply. It must be emphasized, 
  however, that the standards for this safe harbor must be met by all the investors 
  in the entity. To the extent that one class of investors, such as active investors, 
  qualifies, but the passive investors do not meet one of the standards, safe 
  harbor protection is not given to payments to any investors in the entity. 
<p>In this regard, special attention must be paid to cases involving ownership 
  interests held indirectly through other entities. Take a situation, for example, 
  where a group of individuals are passive investors in entity "A", which in turn 
  is the active investor in entity "B." For entity "B" to qualify under this safe 
  harbor provision, entity "A" must meet all the requirements for active investor 
  in entity "B," and the individual investors of entity "A" must meet all the 
  requirements as passive investors in entity "B." 
<p>We believe that this provision will protect investment interests of those with 
  managing partnership interests who establish limited partnerships that meet 
  the standards of this provision. We have decided not to include a third investment 
  interest provision at this time that would place fewer requirements on business 
  structures composed entirely of active investors. We recognize that there are 
  many legitimate small businesses structured in this manner where a group of 
  individuals come together and all of them participate as hands-on managers in 
  the day-to-day operations of the business and undertake personal liability for 
  the entity. Historically, many hospitals were formed in this manner. And currently 
  many group practices and other innovative health care delivery systems are being 
  formed on a bona fide basis in this same manner. However, there are many new 
  entities that have the same business structure, but that may be subject to abuse 
  under the statute. Consequently, we have determined that it is inappropriate 
  to implement a safe harbor provision at this time for entities composed exclusively 
  of active investors that would not have to meet the standards we are implementing 
  in this second investment interest provision. However, we are considering a 
  new safe harbor provision for such investment interests which we anticipate 
  publishing as a separate regulation. 
<p>The safe harbor provision we are including in this rule for investment interests 
  in small entities was developed based on the standards we suggested in the proposed 
  rule, the comments we received on our proposals and our continuing experience 
  in enforcing the statute. This experience includes investigations of abusive 
  joint venture arrangements, our Fraud Alert describing suspect features of these 
  arrangements, and our Report to Congress entitled "Financial Arrangements Between 
  Physicians and Health Care Businesses" (OIG, Office of Analysis and Inspections, 
  May 1989). The Report to Congress disclosed in detail both the extensive ownership 
  of joint ventures by physicians, and the additional services received by patients 
  of these physicians as compared to all Medicare patients in general. 
<p>The standards for this provision are structured into three categories that 
  we have identified as being of concern to us in joint venture arrangements: 
  (1) The manner in which investors are selected and retained, (2) the nature 
  of their business structure, and (3) the financing and profit distributions. 
  To the extent possible, we have adopted bright line rules. We believe that this 
  approach will facilitate compliance because investors will be able to determine 
  easily whether they meet the conditions of safe harbor protection. As discussed 
  in section III.A. above, we are not accepting commenters' suggestions for generic 
  criteria. We believe that such criteria do not provide sufficient protection 
  against abusive arrangements, nor do they provide meaningful guidance to delineate 
  when a provider has complied with them. 
<p>The following discussion will be structured along the lines of the three problem 
  areas we have identified. 
<p>(i) Manner in which investors are selected and retained. In this section we 
  discuss the comments and our responses regarding the problem of the manner in 
  which investors are selected and retained. The first five standards of this 
  investment interest provision protecting small entities (paragraphs (a)(2)(i)- 
  (v)) relate to this problem area. 
<p>Comment: The OIG received mixed comments on the first standard suggested in 
  the proposed rule, that a bona fide opportunity to invest be provided on an 
  equal basis to all investors without regard to their ability to make referrals. 
  A large number of commenters expressed concern about the meaning and workability 
  of this standard, particularly that it is vague and would be difficult to police. 
  Several commenters construed this first suggested standard as a results-oriented 
  test requirement, in other words, that joint ventures must be owned partly by 
  individuals not in a position to make referrals. Some suggested that the OIG 
  place a limit on the percentage of ownership of an entity that can be held by 
  such referring investors. The percentages ranged from 5 percent to 85 percent 
  ownership by referring investors. Others suggested that the OIG should not require 
  these entities to have some amount of non-referring investors. One commenter 
  specifically objected to a requirement that a joint venture have a majority 
  of the ownership interests held by non-referring investors. Five commenters 
  expressed concern that any requirement that investment interests be offered 
  to non- referring individuals may be construed as requiring a public offering, 
  thus triggering the necessity of complying with SEC rules (such as Regulation 
  D governing the limited offering and sale of securities without registration 
  under the Securities Act of 1933, 17 CFR 230.501 <em>et seq</em>.) or State 
  "blue sky" laws which require public securities registration. 
<p>Response: We agree with the concerns expressed by most of the commenters about 
  our first suggested standard. Thus, we are replacing it with three standards 
  (paragraphs (a)(2)(i)-(iii)) in order to better address problems concerning 
  the manner in which investors are selected. To comply with our first standard, 
  investors who make referrals or who are in a position to make referrals or furnish 
  items or services cannot own more than 40 percent of the value of investment 
  interests within each class of investments in the entity. This standard requires 
  not only that a bona fide opportunity to invest has been afforded to people 
  not in a position to make referrals, but that these individuals hold at least 
  60 percent of the value of the investment interests in each class of investments. 
<p>In essence, we are switching a process measure with an outcome measure. As 
  several commenters observed, our proposed standard of equal opportunity to invest 
  contemplated that an equal number of referring and non-referring individuals 
  would be given an opportunity to invest. Such a process-orientated test would 
  have been virtually impossible to monitor. For example, such a standard would 
  have required a joint venture to monitor all marketing solicitations, and determine 
  the referral status of everyone who was solicited to make sure that an equal 
  number of referring and non-referring potential investors were given the opportunity 
  to invest. The alternative outcome measure we are adopting will provide a bright 
  line test which will assist all the parties to the joint venture and the Department 
  in determining whether compliance with this first standard has been achieved. 
<p>Although compliance with this "60-40 percent investment" standard will necessitate 
  some monitoring data, we want to minimize the burden. Therefore, the joint venture 
  is free to use any internal accounting principles it chooses to adopt so long 
  as it uses such principles consistently over time so that it is not manipulating 
  the data to obscure its noncompliance. In addition, we are establishing two 
  alternative time periods in which compliance is to be measured. The measurement 
  period can either be a joint venture's prior fiscal year or the previous 12 
  month period. For example, if a joint venture uses a calendar year as its fiscal 
  year and wants to know in April 1990 whether it is in compliance with this standard, 
  it may either look at the number and status of investors in 1989, or it may 
  use its investor data from March 1989 through March 1990. 
<p>We expect that the parties to a joint venture will find it far preferable to 
  use its prior fiscal year data because if that year's data shows compliance 
  with this standard then the joint venture is in compliance for the entire current 
  fiscal year. The alternative approach of a rolling 12 month average will enable 
  a joint venture to reach compliance sometime within the current fiscal year 
  so that it does not have to remain out of compliance for a full year. However, 
  we also recognize that a joint venture using this rolling 12 month average that 
  is being operated close to this 40 percent line may find itself in compliance 
  one month and then out of compliance the next month. We emphasize that it is 
  highly unlikely we will pursue an investigation of a joint venture where it 
  complies with all the other standards in this safe harbor, is out of compliance 
  with this 60-40 percent investment standard based on its prior fiscal year data, 
  but is making a good-faith effort to reach compliance with this standard based 
  on data showing compliance on a monthly basis for the most recent months of 
  operation. 
<p>As previously discussed, for the purposes of complying with this 60-40 percent 
  investment standard, we are classifying investors who provide items and services 
  together with investors who make or influence referrals to the entity. This 
  classification is necessary to preclude a supplier, such as a DME company, from 
  forming a joint venture with referring physicians, giving them a 39 percent 
  interest in the entity. It would be inappropriate to grant safe harbor protection 
  to such an entity because all of the owners would be doing business with the 
  joint venture by either furnishing items or making referrals. In order to remedy 
  this problem, the DME supplier is classified with the referring physicians for 
  the purposes of this 60-40 percent investment standard. Thus, for example, if 
  a DME supplier and its referral sources want to be investors in an entity with 
  which they will do business, to comply with this first standard, at least 60 
  percent of the value of the investment interests must be held by investors who 
  will neither make referrals nor engage in business activity with the entity. 
<p>The second and third standards of this provision address the problems of discriminatory 
  marketing strategies that result in the offer of better deals, for example, 
  more shares or a better price, to individuals who will refer a high volume of 
  patients. The second standard focuses on the status of investor and bars safe 
  harbor protection where the terms of investment opportunities depend on whether 
  a passive investor is in a position to influence referrals, furnish items or 
  services, or otherwise generate business for the entity. The entity can offer 
  investments to such investors only on the same terms as those offered to other 
  passive investors not in a position to influence the flow of business to the 
  entity. We are not imposing this standard on active investors because we recognize 
  that it is precisely because of a physician's familiarity with the health care 
  field that he or she may be chosen as a general partner and offered different 
  investment terms from those offered to passive investors. 
<p>The third standard assumes that an investment interest is being offered to 
  a person in a position to make referrals, but bars the offering of favorable 
  terms based on his or her past or expected referrals or amount of business otherwise 
  generated for the entity. This standard applies both to active and passive investors 
  because we believe it is inappropriate to protect all investment interests where 
  any investor, even general partners, can obtain more shares because they can 
  be expected to generate more business for the entity. We recognize that there 
  may be situations where it is not abusive to offer more shares based on this 
  consideration, but we also believe that such a practice can have a serious potential 
  for abuse. 
<p>With respect to the potential triggering of a public registration requirement 
  under SEC rules or State "blue sky" laws, we believe that there is nothing in 
  this provision that would compel such a result. Thus, we see no need to modify 
  this provision. 
<p>Comment: In response to the OIG's proposal that no requirement be imposed on 
  the investor to make referrals, many comments dealt with the issue of how investors 
  are retained. Specifically, many commenters objected to requirements, which 
  entities commonly place on investors, that investors must divest their interest 
  if they no longer are able to make referrals to that entity. One commenter suggested 
  that the OIG prohibit entities from<strong> </strong>distributing any information 
  to investors about their referral patterns to that entity. 
<p>Response: We generally agree with these comments and have addressed them in 
  the fourth and fifth standards of this safe harbor provision. (Paragraphs (a) 
  (2) (iv) and (v)). The fourth standard bars the entity from requiring passive 
  investors to make referrals or remain in a position to make referrals as a condition 
  for retaining their investment. The fifth standard parallels the new standard 
  for publicly traded entities and requires the entity and investors not to market 
  or furnish items or services to passive investors in any manner differently 
  than to non-investors. Some examples of practices that would not be protected 
  are provided in the discussion above on the parallel provision for publicly 
  traded entities. These two standards apply only to passive investors because, 
  as we stated, we recognize that active investors are often sought out because 
  they will help generate business for the joint venture. 
<p>This fifth standard also requires the entity and any investor not to promote 
  the services of other entities as part of a cross referral agreement. As we 
  noted in the previous section on publicly traded entities, an example of a cross 
  referral arrangement that would not comply with this standard exists when investors 
  in entity "A" are explicitly or implicitly encouraged to refer to entity "B" 
  in return for entity "A" receiving the referrals from the investors of entity 
  "B." 
<p>Comment: A large number of commenters supported the OIG's third proposal that 
  disclosure of the investment interest be made to individuals for which a referral 
  is made. However, some were opposed to such a requirement. 
<p>Response: For the reasons discussed in section III.B.2. above, we decline to 
  adopt a disclosure requirement. 
<p>(ii) Business structure. In this section we discuss the comments and our responses 
  regarding the problem of the nature of the business structure of joint ventures. 
  The sixth standard (paragraph (a)(2)(vi)) relates to this problem area. 
<p>Comment: The OIG received a large number of comments relating to the business 
  structure of joint ventures, and particularly on the problem that many abusive 
  joint ventures exist primarily on the referrals from their investors. Many of 
  these commenters alleged that such joint ventures are unable to compete for 
  business in the open market on the basis of cost, quality and convenience. These 
  commenters alleged that such joint ventures thereby hurt competition by unfairly 
  "locking in" referrals from investors. However, one trade association reported 
  from a survey of its members that, on average, 47 percent of the referrals to 
  entities operated by its members came from non-investors. Many commenters also 
  expressed concern that abusive joint ventures have no real business purpose, 
  and that the four standards we suggested will not prevent abuse. Four commenters 
  suggested that safe harbor protection be provided where the costs to Medicare 
  and Medicaid are not increased. One commenter observed that, in many cases, 
  the apparent lower costs of joint ventures are illusory because their hours 
  of operation are shorter than those of hospitals. To assure that joint ventures 
  do not raise costs or operate in an abusive manner, a large number of commenters 
  suggested that the OIG require utilization review. 
<p>Response: We agree with the concern that entities protected under this safe 
  harbor provision should not exist by relying on their business coming from referrals 
  from investing physicians. In our experience, a large number of joint ventures 
  are formed with the intent to encourage investors to refer patients to the joint 
  venture. In many cases, the referrals from investing physicians dominate the 
  joint venture's business so that it is does not have to compete for outside 
  business and that it cannot survive without such referrals from its investing 
  physicians. At that point, the business purpose of the joint venture becomes 
  suspect. 
<p>We also agree with commenters who believed that the standards we suggested 
  in the proposed rule will not sufficiently protect against abuse. Although some 
  protection is afforded by the fifth standard we are promulgating which is discussed 
  immediately above (that the entity may not treat a passive investor differently 
  than non-investors), we believe that an additional bright line rule is necessary 
  as a condition of safe harbor protection. 
<p>Therefore, the sixth standard in this provision requires that no more than 
  40 percent of an entity's gross revenue comes from referrals from, or items 
  or services furnished by, investors. This "60-40 percent revenue" standard is 
  reasonable, and, at least according to one commenter's survey of its members, 
  appears to be achievable for many joint ventures. 
<p>This standard, as well as the first standard in this safe harbor provision, 
  provide clear rules which assure that no protection is afforded to joint ventures 
  that operate primarily on the referrals of physician investors. By requiring 
  that no more than 40 percent of the joint venture's revenue come from investors' 
  referrals, we help assure that revenues of these joint ventures come from a 
  wider group than referrals from physician investors. And by limiting the number 
  of investors who make referrals, we help assure that the profits from these 
  entities are distributed to a wider group than referring physician investors. 
  Thus, these two standards will help assure that joint ventures are not dependent 
  on the capital and referrals of physician-investors. 
<p>As part of the Department's program to monitor business arrangements' compliance 
  with these safe harbor provisions (see section III.A. above), we will report 
  to the Secretary on the compliance with these two 60-40 rules (see &#167; 1001.953). 
  This report, which will be issued within 180 days of the publication of this 
  rule, will evaluate whether compliance with these two 60-40 rules adequately 
  controls abusive arrangements or whether more stringent requirements are needed. 
<p>As with the first 60-40 percent standard, we are permitting a joint venture 
  to use any internal accounting principles it chooses to adopt so long as it 
  uses such principles consistently over time so that it is not manipulating the 
  data to obscure its non-compliance. In addition, we are establishing the same 
  two alternative time periods in which compliance is to be measured. The measurement 
  period can either be a joint venture's prior fiscal year or the previous 12 
  month period. Again, as with the first 60-40 percent standard, it is highly 
  unlikely we will pursue an investigation of a joint venture where it complies 
  with all the other standards in this safe harbor, is out of compliance with 
  this 60-40 percent standard based on its prior fiscal year data, but is making 
  a good-faith effort to reach compliance with this standard based on data showing 
  compliance on a monthly basis for the most recent months of operation. 
<p>As noted above in the discussion of our definition of the term "investor," 
  in applying these two 60-40 rules in situations where the joint venture entity 
  is owned by other entities, we will examine the ownership structure of these 
  other entities to determine whether they are owned by physicians who are referring 
  to the joint venture entity. In such a situation, these physicians are considered 
  to be investors of the joint venture entity, and their ownership interest must 
  be offset by non-referring owners and the revenue they generate for the joint 
  venture must be offset by referrals from non-investors. 
<p>We believe the suggestion that we require protected joint ventures to provide 
  services at lower costs to Medicare and Medicaid is unworkable. Although such 
  a feature is obviously a desirable goal, we believe that any analysis of the 
  relative costs of services can only be accomplished meaningfully on a case-by-case 
  basis. Examples of some of the areas such an analysis must examine include: 
  (1) The reimbursement methodology of the service, (2) the patient population 
  being served, (3) the hours of operation, (4) the bad debt and free care policies, 
  and (5) the impact on costs and charges of depreciation of new equipment. These 
  factors must be analyzed for both the joint venture entity and other competing 
  entities to which a comparison is being drawn. 
<p>We believe that utilization review should be encouraged. However, there are 
  many variables that distinguish a successful utilization review program from 
  a sham. For example, utilization review may be conducted under contract by a 
  Peer Review Organization or another independent contractor, or it may be conducted 
  in-house. A critical feature of utilization review is that follow-up or corrective 
  action occurs when a determination is made that a particular practitioner who 
  is under review is engaging in aberrant or substandard behavior. Obviously this 
  action can take many forms, ranging from barring the practitioner from further 
  practice to taking no action at all. Because there are so many variables to 
  an effective utilization review program, we believe it would be overly prescriptive 
  and largely unproductive to impose such a requirement. Thus, we decline to include 
  a utilization review requirement as part of this safe harbor. 
<p>(iii) Financing and profit distributions. In this section we discuss the comments 
  and our responses regarding the problem of the financing and profit distribution 
  of joint ventures. The last two standards (paragraphs (a)(2) (vii) and (viii)) 
  relate to this problem area. 
<p>Comment: As discussed above, a large number of commenters argued that physician 
  involvement in joint ventures is necessary because physicians provide needed 
  capital. Several commenters, however, questioned whether investors are really 
  generating capital for the joint ventures in which they invest. Many suggested 
  that the OIG only protect an investor's capital in cases where the capital was 
  genuinely at risk. In other words, if the investor's interest is obtained through 
  a no-interest loan paid off through deductions from future dividend distributions, 
  there was never really any capital placed in risk. Some suggested that the OIG 
  protect investment interests even where the entity loans the investor funds 
  which are then used to make the capital investment. One commenter reported results 
  from a survey of its members that, on average, 60 percent of the investment 
  from referring physician owners came in the form on non-cash investments (including 
  debt guarantees). 
<p>Response: We agree that a new condition of safe harbor protection is needed 
  to assure that the investments are bona fide, i.e., that investors' funds are 
  genuinely at risk. Thus, the seventh standard of this provision parallels the 
  new standard for the provision dealing with investments in large publicly traded 
  entities: These entities cannot lend the funds or guarantee loans used to make 
  the investment. Consistent with our first investment interest provision, other 
  debt relationships are permitted. For example, the entity may borrow from the 
  investor, and investors may borrow from other sources to obtain funds to use 
  for the capital investment. But as we discussed above, where investors make 
  their investment with money loaned from the entity, they are adding no real 
  capital to it. Thus, this standard will help assure that physicians and other 
  investors in fact provide new needed capital and that the joint venture is not 
  in reality a sham to facilitate the distribution of payments for referrals. 
<p>Comment: The OIG received a large number of comments suggesting other protections 
  to assure non-abusive financing arrangements and, in particular, urging the 
  OIG to protect "nominal" investments. Many suggested that the OIG specify an 
  upper limit on the amount an individual may invest, either in terms of a dollar 
  amount or a percentage interest in the entity. Some specifically suggested a 
  5 percent limit. Three commenters took another approach and suggested a minimum 
  capitalization amount, pointing out that many of the more abusive arrangements 
  have minimal capital needs. 
<p>Response: We believe that individuals with a small investment in an entity 
  may be just as likely as those with a large investment stake to be influenced 
  to make referrals to the entity. Many of the more abusive joint venture arrangements 
  of which we are aware offer only nominal investments to physicians. We believe 
  that, in many cases, these nominal investment interests are designed to induce 
  referrals or encourage the investor to otherwise generate business for the entity. 
  In addition, by distributing the benefits of ownership to as wide a base of 
  physician investors as possible, these joint ventures seek to lock-up their 
  market, and thus operate in an insulated business environment largely free from 
  normal competitive pressures such as pricing constraints. 
<p>We believe that it is not useful to impose a minimum capitalization requirement. 
  Because each joint venture has different capital needs, it is not possible to 
  specify one level of capitalization that would represent a reasonable floor 
  for all joint ventures. For example, requiring at least $500,000 in capitalization 
  would obviously be viewed very differently by a laboratory joint venture than 
  by a magnetic resonance imaging joint venture. We do believe, however, that 
  it is useful to analyze joint ventures on a case- by-case basis to determine 
  what the real capital needs of the project are, and whether the capital that 
  has been invested is merely a sham to pay investors for referrals. 
<p>Comment: We received a large number of comments on one of the standards suggested 
  in the preamble to the proposed rule, that payments not be related to referrals. 
  We also received other comments relating to the general problem of the manner 
  in which profits are distributed. Many commenters suggested that the OIG limit 
  the return on investment which will be subject to protection. Some suggested 
  merely that the return be "reasonable," while another commenter stressed that 
  there is no realistic way to determine an appropriate cut-off for a return on 
  investment that would still be classified as "reasonable." One commenter suggested 
  that, because there is less potential for abuse with repayments on debt instruments, 
  the OIG should treat these payments differently from profit distributions. 
<p>Response: The eighth standard in this provision is that the amount of payment 
  to each investor must be directly proportional to his or her capital investment. 
  In other words, to receive protection, dividend payments can only be tied to 
  the number of shares owned by an investor, and not to his or her referrals. 
  Where investors, such as general partners, contribute capital in the form of 
  pre-operational services or sweat equity, their dividend payments may reflect 
  the fair market value of those services rendered. 
<p>This standard in no way protects payments to active investors for operational 
  services they provide to the joint venture. By its very terms, this provision 
  only protects payments that represent a return on investment. Safe harbor protection 
  for the personal services that an active investor renders would be governed 
  by the "personal services and management contracts" provisions (paragraph (d)). 
<p>With respect to limiting the return on investment, we believe that it would 
  be arbitrary to specify a limitation applicable for all joint ventures, and 
  that it would be meaningless to merely specify as a general criterion that the 
  return "be reasonable." As many commenters pointed out, a reasonable return 
  can be appropriately measured only in light of the risk of the investment. An 
  investor would surely expect a much higher return from an investment in an expensive 
  piece of diagnostic equipment that might soon become obsolete than from an investment 
  in a relatively inexpensive piece of equipment that can be expected to generate 
  a steady profit stream for the foreseeable future. 
<p>With respect to repayments on debt instruments, we believe that it is unnecessary 
  to create a separate provision for debt instruments, but, as discussed in section 
  III.C.1.a. above, this provision is written to protect a variety of payments 
  in securities, including debt instruments. 
<p>c. Proposals for New Safe Harbor Provisions 
<p>A large number of comments were received urging the OIG to provide special 
  protection for investments in certain special circumstances which would not 
  qualify under the safe harbor provisions suggested in the proposed rule. 
<p>Note: Any discussion below indicating that we are considering a new safe harbor 
  provision should in no way be construed as legalizing the business arrangement 
  at this time. 
<p>Comment: A large majority of these commenters requested protection for ambulatory 
  surgical centers (ASCs). Many of these commenters believed that the OIG was 
  attempting to eliminate ASCs. In presenting the benefits of ASCs, these commenters 
  made many of the same arguments discussed in section III.C1.b. above, regarding 
  the positive features of joint ventures in general. In addition, many commenters 
  emphasized the unique features of ASCs: (1) They are subject to peer review; 
  (2) they provide services at lower prices than hospitals; (3) they were formed 
  to a very large extent by physicians, and (4) in many cases, they are really 
  an extension of a physician's practice. Several other commenters suggested protection 
  for payments from other types of entities based on a rationale similar to this 
  latter "extension of practice" argument. For example, commenters wanted protection 
  for physicians providing inpatient services for their patients, nephrologists 
  performing services at renal dialysis facilities, pathologists examining test 
  results in laboratories, and radiation therapy oncologists performing radiation 
  therapy services at outpatient centers. 
<p>Response: We understand that a special situation may exist when a physician 
  sees a patient in his or her office, makes a referral to an entity in which 
  he or she has an ownership interest and performs the service for which the referral 
  is made. In such a situation, Medicare makes payment to the facility for the 
  service it furnishes, which may result in a profit distribution to the physician. 
  And the physician may also receive reimbursement from the program for performing 
  the professional service. 
<p>We believe that, with respect to the physician's own fee, such a referral is 
  simply a referral to oneself. It should not matter whether the patient is first 
  seen at the office or at the facility. Consequently, we believe that, in this 
  situation, both the professional service fee and the profit distribution from 
  the associated facility fee that are generated from this referral may warrant 
  protection. However, we remain concerned about the investing physician's ability 
  to profit from any diagnostic testing that is generated from the services he 
  or she performs. We are also concerned about the extent to which we should modify 
  this second investment interest safe harbor to protect a physician-investor's 
  profit in other joint venture entities where he or she both makes a referral 
  and performs some level of service for the referred patient at the entity. Therefore, 
  we are considering a safe harbor provision, that we anticipate publishing as 
  a separate regulation to protect these payments where there is no likelihood 
  of abuse. 
<p>We believe that a broader exemption at this time for payments from ASCs and 
  similar entities is not appropriate. We recognize that many of these entities, 
  and ASCs in particular, have operated under the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
  largely without abuse and have saved these programs money when compared to some 
  alternative treatment settings, particularly inpatient hospital care. We also 
  recognize that one of the fundamental purposes of the statute is to prevent 
  abusive business arrangements that increase cost to the Medicare and Medicaid 
  programs. However, our approach is one of providing standards that define categories 
  of business arrangements and business practices that will be given safe harbor 
  protection. Our approach is not one of providing protection to particular categories 
  of health care providers who earn it by being lawful or cost-effective. 
<p>We remain concerned about the widespread apprehension expressed by those commenters 
  with an ownership interest in ASCs. Many commenters did not understand that 
  the investment interest safe harbor provisions upon which we invited comment 
  would protect many of the situations about which the commenters claimed no protection 
  was being offered. In addition, as we made clear in section III.A. above, when 
  an investment interest does not qualify under one of the safe harbor provisions, 
  it does not mean that prosecution is imminent. The business arrangement may 
  not even violate the statute, or, after examination on a case-by-case basis, 
  we may conclude that prosecution is not warranted. Our disinclination to provide 
  blanket protection for all investment interests in ASCs does not mean that we 
  hold them in disfavor. 
<p>2. Space and Equipment Rental and Personal Services and Management Contracts-- 
<p>&#167;&#167; 1001.952 (b), (c), and (d) 
<p>Comment: An overwhelming number of commenters criticized the restrictive definition 
  of fair market value in the safe harbor provision for space rental. Many expressed 
  concern that the safe harbor does not exempt rental payments that take into 
  account added value attributable to a rental property's intended use as a facility 
  for furnishing medical, laboratory, or other health services. Some were disappointed 
  that this safe harbor provision does not appear to allow adjustments in rental 
  charges for special construction or renovation costs incurred by the lessor 
  to make the space suitable for furnishing medical services. Other commenters 
  argued that the added value to providers of locating in a building or area proximate 
  and convenient to other health care providers is a legitimate factor in calculating 
  rent and may bear no relationship to prospective referrals of Medicare or Medicaid 
  program business. They contended that the close proximity of rental property 
  to other health care providers justifies elevated rent because both providers 
  and their patients view such location as a convenience. 
<p>Response: The safe harbor provision for space rental does not contemplate a 
  single figure for fair market value. Rather, it contemplates a rental fee falling 
  within a reasonable commercial range, but not taking into account any value 
  attached by either party based upon the property's proximity or<strong> </strong>convenience 
  to referral sources. To the extent there is a nexus between the location of 
  property and the opportunity to engage in business reimbursable under Medicare 
  or Medicaid, rental charges that take location into account may impermissibly 
  generate referrals or other health care business. For example, we believe that 
  a fair inference may be drawn that impermissible payments are being made when 
  a group of doctors owns a medical arts building and rents space in that building 
  to a diagnostic laboratory, and the rent is substantially above the laboratory' 
  s cost of renting the same sized space at a nearby location. 
<p>Consequently, we decline to extend safe harbor protection to space rental charges 
  that take into account any value attached to property due to the proximity of 
  referral sources. We have modified the definition of fair market value in this 
  provision to clarify that protection does not extend to rental charges reflecting 
  the value attributed by either party to the proximity or convenience of property 
  to potential sources of referrals or other business from the other party. However, 
  we would note that where the lessor is a real estate developer or other entity 
  not involved in the delivery of health care services, any arrangements that 
  encourage referrals between the lessee and other third parties would not likely 
  be scrutinized by the OIG. 
<p>However, we recognize that there may be instances where rental fees for medical, 
  laboratory or other health related office space are justifiably higher than 
  the market price for comparable commercial property. For example, we agree with 
  commenters who stated that the cost of leasehold improvements needed to make 
  space suitable for the furnishing of medical services (such as extra plumbing 
  or electrical costs) should be considered within the provision's definition 
  of fair market value. Accordingly, we have further amended this safe harbor's 
  definition of fair market value to delete the requirement that fair market value 
  not take into account the intended use of rental space. However, we have retained 
  the requirement that rental payments be commensurate with the fair market value 
  of equivalent commercial property, and decline to extend blanket safe harbor 
  protection to rental arrangements that reflect the added value a hospital places 
  on having referring physicians located in a medical building the hospital owns 
  on its property. We recognize that this requirement will preclude safe harbor 
  protection for many health care providers who lease space to physicians or suppliers 
  at a reduced rate due to the favorable location of the property. In particular, 
  hospitals that give rent concessions to staff physicians leasing private office 
  space may not fall within the safe harbor. For a discussion of how such payments 
  may qualify as part of a physician recruitment effort, see section III.D. below. 
<p>Comment: A few commenters inquired whether rental arrangements involving both 
  the use of office space and the furnishing of personal or management services 
  must meet the requirements of both safe harbor provisions in order to be protected 
  from liability under the statute. 
<p>Response: In section III.A. above, we addressed generally the circumstances 
  under which the requirements of two relevant safe harbor provisions must be 
  met in order to be protected under this regulation. However, because several 
  commenters specifically requested guidance about contracts involving the rental 
  of space and the furnishing of personal services, we are responding to their 
  comments here. 
<p>To the extent that office rental payments include the value of other personal 
  services furnished as part of a business arrangement, the payments must reflect 
  the fair market value of the rent and these personal services in order to qualify 
  under the safe harbor regulation. To be exempt from kickback liability, arrangements 
  involving remuneration for rental and personal services must meet the conditions 
  of each provision. For example, where a mobile business provides diagnostic 
  services to patients in physicians' offices, and contracts for diagnostic equipment 
  or for cleaning, billing or other services in addition to renting office space 
  from these physicians, the arrangement must qualify under the provisions for 
  space and equipment rental and personal services and management contracts. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters, expressing support for a strong and effective 
  anti-kickback statute, stated that sham office leases in which the space is 
  not actually used are among the most common and abusive kickback schemes. Examples 
  of such abusive schemes cited by commenters included physicians who entered 
  into office rental contracts with other referring physicians, solely in order 
  to obtain the referrals, and diagnostic services companies and clinical laboratories 
  that lease space from physicians which the laboratories in reality do not use, 
  as kickbacks for the physicians' patient referrals. 
<p>Response: We agree that sham contracts in which remuneration is exchanged for 
  property that does not exist or space which is not used are among the most egregious 
  kickback arrangements. We have become aware of office rental arrangements in 
  which the "space" rented may not be large enough or otherwise suitable to perform 
  any services for which rent could legitimately be paid. For example, a physician 
  may rent office space to a clinical laboratory, allegedly in order to provide 
  space to furnish laboratory services, when the space (often a closet or anteroom 
  not useable for such purposes) is not actually occupied by laboratory personnel 
  at any time. If the physician refers most or all laboratory work to this lessee, 
  the "rent" is simply remuneration for referring laboratory work. 
<p>We believe, however, that these safe harbor provisions are sufficient to protect 
  against this abuse. These provisions require that the amount of payments for 
  rent, equipment or personal services contracts not take into account the volume 
  or value of referrals or other business generated between the parties. If a 
  sham contract is entered into, which on paper looks like it complies with these 
  provisions, but where there is no intent to have the space or equipment used 
  or the services provided, then clearly we will look behind the contract and 
  find that in reality payments are based on referrals. Thus, these contracts 
  would not be protected under these provisions. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters stated that the safe harbor requirements for determining 
  fair market value of rental space should be the same requirements of section 
  501(c)(3) of title 26 of the United States Code, the Internal Revenue Code section 
  governing tax exemptions for nonprofit institutions. Under this section, fair 
  market value assessments are necessary to determine whether hospital/physician 
  arrangements result in the prohibited inurement of private benefit to individuals. 
<p>Response: We do not believe that procedures for assessing the fair market value 
  of hospital/physician arrangements under the Internal Revenue Code are relevant 
  to safe harbor requirements under the anti-kickback statute. The anti-kickback 
  statute is concerned with prohibiting fraud and abuse by individuals and entities 
  participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a statute providing tax 
  exemptions to nonprofit institutions under specified conditions does not share 
  this focus. The requirements we have set forth for determining fair market value 
  under the safe harbor regulation are not undermined by the fact that they do 
  not replicate the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, we 
  cannot see, nor has any commenter adequately explained, how these regulations 
  impede health care providers' ability to obtain tax exempt status under the 
  Internal Revenue Code. 
<p>Comment: Commenters requested clarification as to whether these safe harbor 
  provisions protect any types of percentage, "per use" or "per procedure" leases 
  or contracts in which the amount of compensation fluctuates in accordance with 
  the actual use of premises or equipment, or the frequency of services performed. 
  A few commenters inquired whether percentage leases between parties in a position 
  to refer Medicare or Medicaid business were a per se violation of the statute. 
  Many commenters urged the OIG to extend safe harbor protection to per use equipment 
  leases, and to percentage contracts for personal services, in which total business, 
  in contrast to referral business, is the basis for payment. With regard to equipment 
  leases, several commenters argued that these provisions should protect equipment 
  lessors who receive higher rent based on increased use, because the useful life 
  and value of equipment depreciates with use. 
<p>Response: As we explained in section III.A. above, in discussing wear and tear 
  clauses, percentage or per use agreements between health care providers in a 
  position to refer Medicare or Medicaid business threaten to violate the statute 
  because the payments in these arrangements are directly tied to the volume of 
  business or amount of revenue generated, providing an improper incentive to 
  refer. Moreover, historically, percentage leases and contracts have been rife 
  with abuse. <br>
  <br>
<p>These sorts of arrangements need to be examined on a case-by-case basis. For 
  example, a lease to a hospital of major medical equipment, such as a magnetic 
  resonance imaging scanner, may specify that higher rent is to be paid when more 
  than a predetermined number of procedures is performed. Such an arrangement 
  can be troublesome if the lessor is a partnership of radiologists on the hospital's 
  medical staff, because the incentive for overutilization is clear. It is the 
  nature of the relationship, if any, between overall volume of use and referrals, 
  that triggers the statute. Thus, if the owner of equipment were not in a position 
  to make referrals to the lessee, the agreement would not violate the statute. 
<p>For these reasons, we specifically decline to protect rental charges or compensation 
  for personal services where the aggregate amounts of payments are not set out 
  in advance. This does not mean, however, that percentage or per use leases and 
  contracts that are based on overall volume (including business from referral 
  sources with no financial interest to motivate them), are per se violations 
  of the statute. We recognize that legitimate considerations, such as the depreciation 
  of equipment, could result in some part of the payment to be based on a percentage 
  or "per use" payment arrangement without these payments influencing or being 
  influenced by Medicare or Medicaid referrals. However, the more the payments 
  appear to reflect the volume of referrals from the financially-interested party, 
  the more suspect the arrangement becomes and the more likely we will need to 
  examine it carefully. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters were opposed to the condition that space and equipment 
  leases and personal services and management contracts run for periods of not 
  less than one year. They argued that the one year condition was superfluous, 
  given additional restrictions relating to fair market value and referral relationships 
  between the parties. They also argued that the one year rule would preclude 
  many legitimate short-term arrangements, such as leases of state-of-the-art 
  imaging equipment by health care providers who could not afford a full year's 
  lease. Some health care providers claimed that the rule would cause them to 
  forsake good business judgment in order to obtain needed equipment or services. 
<p>Commenters were most concerned about the one year requirement in the context 
  of personal services and management contracts. Several commenters argued that 
  many professional services typically contracted for by health care providers, 
  from medical or surgical consulting services to peer review functions, involve 
  projects or activities that require less than one year to complete. They argued 
  that it is inefficient and wasteful for health care providers to enter into 
  contracts for periods of one year under these circumstances. Additionally, a 
  few commenters sought clarification as to the effect of the one year rule on 
  leases terminated for cause prior to the expiration of a contract extending 
  one year or longer. In particular, there was concern that the conditions of 
  the space rental safe harbor not conflict with Internal Revenue Service guidelines 
  governing advance determinations of tax exempt status. These guidelines require 
  tax exempt facilities to be able to terminate, within 90 days notice, contracts 
  with non-exempt persons where compensation is based on fees charged for services 
  furnished by the non-exempt persons. 
<p>Response: We have retained the one year contract requirement as a condition 
  for safe harbor protection under the space rental, equipment rental, and personal 
  services and management contracts safe harbor provisions. We included the one 
  year rule limitation in these provisions because we are concerned about abuse 
  resulting from periodic renegotiation of ostensibly short term agreements, in 
  response to changes in referral patterns. For example, if a health care provider 
  rents office space to another individual or entity with whom he or she is in 
  an ongoing referral relationship, and these providers alter their rental terms 
  with frequency, the volume or value of referrals can influence the size of renegotiated 
  rental payments. When rental charges are constantly subject to modification, 
  the threat to the lessor of receiving reduced rent, or the threat to the lessee 
  of paying higher rent, may improperly induce increased referrals. However, we 
  recognize that health care providers may enter into short-term leases or services 
  contracts for legitimate business reasons and not on account of referral opportunities. 
  For example, an academic physician who spends one semester or school year visiting 
  at another medical university may need to rent office space from the medical 
  university for less than a year. <br>
  <br>
<p>Several commenters expressed concern that contracts for the performance of 
  activities or services that, by their very nature, take less than one year, 
  would necessarily fall outside the safe harbor provision for personal services 
  and management contracts. However, the one year contract requirement restricts 
  the period within which contract terms may not be changed, and not the time 
  within which services under a contract may be performed. So long as contract 
  terms are not altered within a one year period, an agreement that is performed 
  in less than one year's time will meet the one year requirement in the safe 
  harbor provision. 
<p>With regard to the comments we received concerning early termination clauses 
  in leases or contracts extending not less than one year, we acknowledge the 
  customary use of such provisions for tax and other legitimate business purposes. 
  The legitimacy of an early termination clause in a lease or contract which otherwise 
  meets the conditions of these three provisions depends on the parties' intent. 
  Termination "for cause" clauses drafted in compliance with Internal Revenue 
  Service or other legal or regulatory requirements should not jeopardize safe 
  harbor status, if the purpose of the termination clause is to comply with those 
  requirements, and not to facilitate renegotiation of contract terms. If a contract 
  is terminated in accordance with a legally enforceable termination clause, the 
  failure to renew the contract would provide evidence that the termination was 
  effectuated for a legitimate purpose. 
<p>Comment: The safe harbor provisions governing space and equipment rental and 
  personal services and management contracts provide that when the property or 
  service is to be provided on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, the agreement 
  must specify precisely the timing and duration of rental periods and compensation 
  charged for each period. Numerous commenters were troubled by these requirements. 
  They argued that furnishing professional services and leasing space and equipment 
  on an "as needed" basis are commercially acceptable, cost-effective business 
  practices that should be protected so long as the rate of compensation is commercially 
  reasonable. They also stated that under many periodic lease and contract arrangements, 
  precise intervals of activity or use, and the exact compensation for these intervals, 
  cannot feasibly be specified in advance. In addition, there was concern that 
  requiring specificity of time intervals and compensation as conditions for safe 
  harbor protection would interfere with the flexibility necessary to accommodate 
  changing demand, and would increase costs in situations where the demand proved 
  lower than expected at the time the contract was made. Finally, a few commenters 
  asked for clarification of the meaning of the word "periodicity" in these three 
  provisions when the space or equipment lease or personal services agreement 
  is not on a full-time basis. 
<p>Response: Part-time contractual arrangements and periodic access leases between 
  health care providers are especially vulnerable to abuse because they are subject 
  to modification based on changing referral patterns between the parties. For 
  example, an optometrist who pays ad hoc "rent" to an ophthalmologist for the 
  time spent in the physician's office examining only referred patients, is impermissibly 
  paying for the referrals. In order to avoid the potential for abuse inherent 
  in part-time business arrangements between parties in actual or potential referral 
  relationships, we have limited safe harbor protection under these three provisions 
  to periodic leases and contracts which set forth the timing, frequency, and 
  length of services or intervals of use. 
<p>We recognize that health care providers, for various reasons, may be unable 
  to specify the timing or duration of business arrangements, or the precise compensation 
  involved. For example, compensation under a management contract requiring the 
  furnishing of supplies and the hiring of personnel may need to vary depending 
  on the costs of the supplies and number of personnel. Or, a health care provider 
  may contract with an allied health practitioner group (such as a physical therapy 
  group) to pay a specific amount per hour of care provided, without being able 
  to anticipate the scheduling of services in advance. We believe that part-time 
  leases or service arrangements that do not meet safe harbor standards need to 
  be analyzed on a case-by-case basis under the statute. Many periodic contracts 
  of this sort would fall outside the statute because the compensation involved 
  is not linked to referral opportunities. A contract to serve as medical director 
  of a small clinic on a part-time basis, for example, is not likely to involve 
  activities or compensation tied to the referral of patients or to arrangement 
  for services reimbursable under Medicare or Medicaid programs. 
<p>Finally, we are deleting the word "periodicity" from these three provisions 
  because it duplicates the requirements that the rental or equipment lease or 
  personal services agreement specify the schedule of intervals, their precise 
  length, and payments for the intervals. 
<p>Comment: Three commenters requested the OIG to protect marketing and advertising 
  activities because such activities either promote competition or do not violate 
  the statute. 
<p>Response: The statute on its face prohibits the offering or acceptance of remuneration, 
  inter alia, for the purposes of "arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, 
  or ordering any. . . service or item" payable under Medicare or Medicaid. Thus, 
  we believe that many marketing and advertising activities may involve at least 
  technical violations of the statute. We, of course, recognize that many of these 
  advertising and marketing activities do not warrant prosecution in part because 
  (1) they are passive in nature, i.e., the activities do not involve direct contact 
  with program beneficiaries, or (2) the individual or entity involved in these 
  promotions is not involved in the delivery of health care. Such individuals 
  or entities are not in a position of public trust in the same manner as physicians 
  or other health care professionals who recommend or order products and services 
  for their patients. Thus, we agree that many advertising and marketing activities 
  warrant safe harbor protection under the personal services and management contracts 
  safe harbor. 
<p>However, we have experienced many instances where promoters and consultants 
  have become involved in marketing activities that encourage health care providers 
  and others to violate the statute, such as to develop impermissible joint venture 
  arrangements or to routinely waive coinsurance and deductible amounts owed under 
  Medicare Part B. It would be inappropriate to allow such activities to receive 
  safe harbor protection. 
<p>Thus, we are adding paragraph (d)(6) to this safe harbor provision to make 
  clear that the service that is contracted for is not protected if it involves 
  the counselling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity which 
  itself constitutes a violation of any State or Federal law. However, the safe 
  harbor (revised as indicated) protects contracts where the individual paid under 
  the contract counsels or promotes business arrangements or other activities 
  that are either specifically exempted under one of the provisions of this regulation 
  or otherwise do not violate the statute. 
<p>Comment: Four commenters sought specific protection for commission sales arrangements 
  between health care providers and independent contractors. 
<p>Response: We see no reason, nor has any commenter claimed to have provided 
  one, for treating commission sales agreements differently under these regulations 
  from other types of contracts for personal services performed by independent 
  contractors. Therefore, commission sales agreements must meet the conditions 
  of the safe harbor provisions governing personal services and management contracts. 
<p>3. Sale of Practice--&#167; 1001.952(e) 
<p>Comment: While many commenters supported the one-year limitation on the completion 
  of a sale of a practice, others believed that it is too short. One commenter 
  asserted that such a limitation would effectively ban option<strong> </strong>agreements 
  on sales of physicians' practices. 
<p>Response: We decline to protect option agreements or sales which extend beyond 
  one year because, as we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, we believe 
  that this is an area of significant abuse. Often, sales and option agreements 
  are designed solely to ensure referrals, and payments for the sale or option 
  agreement are actually payments for referrals. The one-year limit serves to 
  protect sales where the sale occurs because the physician is no longer going 
  to be practicing and not because the purchaser seeks an ongoing stream of referrals. 
  To the extent that one can enter into an option agreement, exercise that option 
  and complete the purchase of the practice within one year from the date the 
  option agreement is entered into, this aspect of the transaction will fall within 
  this safe harbor provision. 
<p>Many commenters appeared confused about whether the provision requires payments 
  from the sale to be completed within one year. This provision does not preclude 
  a purchaser from making payments to a practitioner beyond the one- year period 
  as long as the other conditions of this provision have been met. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters strongly supported the one-year grace period from 
  the date of a purchase agreement to complete the purchase, and during which 
  time referrals would be permissible. One commenter believed this period should 
  be shortened to six months, but others stated that it should be longer than 
  one year. 
<p>Response: We were presented with no persuasive reason to extend or shorten 
  this one-year period and we therefore decline to revise this limitation period. 
<p>Comment: Several hospitals requested protection for their purchases of the 
  practices of retiring physicians. 
<p>Response: When a hospital purchases a physician's practice and thereafter there 
  are no referrals from that physician to the hospital, the statute would not 
  appear to be implicated. Accordingly, in ordinary circumstances, a hospital 
  is not in violation of the statute if it purchases the practice of a retiring 
  physician who no longer makes referrals to that hospital. 
<p>However, many hospitals engage in this practice as part of a physician recruitment 
  effort. Such activities do implicate the statute, but we are considering a new 
  safe harbor provision, that we anticipate publishing as a separate regulation, 
  to protect many such recruitment activities. 
<p>Comment: Several hospitals requested that their practice of buying physicians' 
  practices for fair market value and then retaining the physicians on staff be 
  afforded the protection of a safe harbor. They asserted that the financial pressures 
  of maintaining private practices have drawn physicians to hospitals in order 
  to get management assistance and capital. 
<p>Response: As we stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, hospitals often 
  purchase physicians' practices in order to ensure the hospital of a steady stream 
  of referrals. We continue to believe that such practices lead to increased program 
  costs and potential conflicts between the patient's best interests and the physician's 
  business relationship to the hospital. Accordingly, we decline to protect a 
  practice that often leads to the very abuses that the statute is designed to 
  prevent. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters requested safe harbor protection for the sale of 
  an individual's practice to a group practice or the sale of part of a practice 
  to another physician or group practice when the physician chooses to change 
  the scope of his or her practice. 
<p>Response: We recognize that some buy-out arrangements are not abusive, and 
  we would not want to prosecute such arrangements. However, we are also aware 
  of abusive purchase arrangements, such as between ophthalmologists and optometrists, 
  where one practitioner or group practice seeks to buy another practitioner's 
  practice as a condition for continuing to make referrals. In essence, the sale 
  becomes another mechanism for the buyer to profit from the stream of referrals 
  made to the seller who previously practiced independently without dividing profits 
  with the new "partner." No commenter proposed standards for a safe harbor provision 
  that would cover only arrangements that are not abusive, and we are skeptical 
  that such standards can be formulated. Accordingly, we have not protected this 
  very diverse category of sales of practices. Rather, we are considering a limited 
  new safe harbor provision for the purchase of group practices that we anticipate 
  publishing as a separate regulation. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters asked the OIG to clarify the relationship between the 
  safe harbor provision for the sale of a practice and the employee exception. 
<p>Response: Where a practitioner purchases another practitioner's practice, makes 
  payments to that other practitioner which continue for some period of time, 
  and retains that other practitioner on his or her staff as an employee, we believe 
  that such payments are not protected under this provision or the employee exception. 
  They do not qualify under this provision because the practitioner who sold the 
  practice remains in a position to make referrals. The payments are not protected 
  by the employee exception because that provision only protects payments "for 
  employment in the provision of covered items or services * * * ." These payments, 
  however, relate to the purchase of a practice and not to services provided pursuant 
  to employment for the provision of items or services. Of course, the employing 
  practitioner who has bought out the other practitioner is making other payments 
  for such employment services, and if a bona fide employment relationship as 
  defined in 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2) exists, then these payments are protected under 
  the employee safe harbor provision. As noted in the General comments section 
  in section III.A. above, where parties are attempting to comply with two safe 
  harbor provisions, we would expect separate justifications for compliance with 
  each provision. 
<p>4. Referral Services--&#167; 1001.952(f) 
<p>Comment: Many commenters urged the OIG to extend this safe harbor provision 
  beyond only physicians to include payments by chiropractors, dentists, podiatrists, 
  psychologists, nursing homes and other health care providers to entities that 
  refer members of the public to them. 
<p>Response: We agree and have revised this provision to protect payments by practitioners 
  and other health care providers who utilize referral services. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters requested that the OIG define the term "qualified" 
  with respect to the requirement that a referral service not exclude any "qualified" 
  health care provider from participation in the service. 
<p>Response: Whether a particular health care provider is "qualified" as a participant 
  in a referral service will vary depending on how the service is organized. For 
  instance, to be qualified as a participant in a referral service run by a hospital, 
  it may be necessary that the participant be an employee of that hospital. On 
  the other hand, a referral service run by a professional organization may require 
  only that the participant be a dues- paying member of that organization to qualify 
  for participation. The determination as to whether a particular health care 
  provider is "qualified" to participate in the service may be made by the referral 
  service according to its own criteria. To be protected under this safe harbor, 
  the referral service must apply the eligibility<strong> </strong>criteria equally 
  to all participants in the referral service. 
<p>In addition, the referral service must disclose to all persons seeking a referral 
  the criteria it uses to determine who is qualified as a participant. The information 
  that must be disclosed includes the manner in which it selects the pool of participants. 
  In other words, if a pregnant woman calls a hospital's referral service, the 
  referral service must disclose how it selects obstetricians to be qualified 
  to receive referrals and whether the obstetrician has paid a fee to participate. 
  The referral service must also disclose how the particular obstetrician is selected 
  for the referral, for example, on a rotation basis. In addition, the referral 
  service must disclose the relationship between the participant and the referral 
  service, for example, that the obstetrician is on the active medical staff. 
  Finally, the referral service must disclose what criteria it uses to exclude 
  an individual or entity from continuing as a participant, for example, if a 
  malpractice allegation is raised against the obstetrician or if he or she refuses 
  to treat a certain level of uncompensated care cases. 
<p>The referral service must maintain a written record certifying that such disclosures 
  have been made to each person seeking a referral. Such a record must be signed 
  by either the person seeking the referral or by the individual making the disclosure 
  on behalf of the referral service. This requirement will not be met if the referral 
  service merely maintains a blank copy of the disclosure form or instructions 
  to staff on how to make the disclosure. 
<p>Comment: One commenter suggested that a referral service should be permitted 
  to require the practitioners or providers to charge clients that are referred 
  by the service the same fees as they charge other clients. 
<p>Response: We agree and have revised paragraph (f)(3) to permit referral services 
  to bar participants from engaging in discriminatory pricing practices. 
<p>Comment: A few commenters were uncertain about what fees could be charged for 
  the referral service. They questioned whether the referral fee must be paid 
  prior to the referral and whether a set amount could be charged for each referral. 
<p>Response: This provision protects fee payments that are related only to the 
  cost of operating the referral service. This provision explicitly does not protect 
  fees that in any manner are based on the volume or value of Medicare or Medicaid 
  referrals or business otherwise generated by the participant for the referral 
  service. While a referral fee need not be paid in full before any referrals 
  are made, paragraph (f)(2) specifies that referral fees may not be based on 
  the volume of referrals to the practitioner or provider. 
<p>Comment: One commenter asked whether the disclosure requirements of this provision 
  could be satisfied by sending a letter to the referred person after the referral 
  is made. 
<p>Response: Although the method of disclosure is not prescribed, to meet the 
  requirements of this provision any disclosure must constitute effective disclosure. 
  Effective disclosure requires that the relevant information is communicated 
  in time for the information to be used by the beneficiary before an important 
  decision is made. Accordingly, it is unlikely that disclosure after the referral 
  has been made would constitute effective disclosure if the beneficiary had already 
  seen the health care provider, or in some cases, if the appointment had already 
  been made. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters questioned whether the statute and, therefore, 
  this safe harbor provision, applies to referral services where health care providers 
  are not charged for the services or where the services are provided pursuant 
  to association dues. 
<p>Response: The statute applies to such referral services. The statute is implicated 
  not only where direct payments are made in return for referrals, but also where 
  indirect forms of remuneration are given for referrals. For example, hospitals 
  often operate free referral services for members of their medical staffs as 
  one of the benefits that comes with being on that hospital's staff. In return 
  for the benefits of staff privileges (including the free referral service), 
  physicians have a variety of obligations, such as sitting on various hospital 
  committees. Depending on the circumstances, the services physicians furnish 
  a hospital to assist in its operations may constitute a form of remuneration 
  to the hospital for providing the referral service, and would be covered by 
  the statute. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit found: 
  "Giving a person an opportunity to earn money may well be an inducement to that 
  person to channel potential Medicare payments towards a particular recipient." 
  <em>United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hospital Rental Service, Inc</em>., 
  <em>supra</em>, 874 F.2d at 29. Therefore, staff physicians and hospitals seeking 
  safe harbor protection must comply with this provision when they are engaged 
  in a referral service that does not charge a specific fee. 
<p>5. Warranties--&#167; 1001.952(g) 
<p>Comment: Two commenters objected to the requirement that as a condition for 
  protection the warranty include payments to compensate for any costs associated 
  with the replacement of the product that is the subject of the warranty. These 
  commenters pointed out that virtually no warranties now in existence pay for 
  such expenses and that this requirement will necessitate the revision of warranty 
  policies, which in turn must be paid for by price increases to cover this additional 
  liability expense. 
<p>Response: We agree with the concern over the potential that this standard will 
  increase costs, and are deleting it. We are revising this provision based on 
  the Federal Trade Commission interpretation of 15 U.S.C. 2301(6), which does 
  not require the manufacturer to make full payment to compensate for all costs 
  associated with its defective product. <br>
  <br>
<p>Comment: One pacemaker manufacturer noted that a particular warranty complied 
  with the discount exception, implying that it need not comply with this warranty 
  provision. 
<p>Response: We do not believe that warranty arrangements fit within the "discount" 
  safe harbor provision, and are revising that provision accordingly. However, 
  we agree that some of the policies underlying the discount exception should 
  apply to warranties. Consequently, with respect to any reductions of equipment 
  prices offered as part of a warranty agreement, we are requiring the same disclosure 
  requirements as contained in the discount provision. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters urged the OIG to expand this safe harbor provision 
  to protect "competitive replacement agreements." Under such an agreement, for 
  example, a company offers various inducements to encourage hospitals (or other 
  entities such as ASCs) and physicians to replace a defective pacemaker with 
  one made by the company offering the inducements. These commenters argued that 
  these arrangements should be protected because they make it easier to purchase 
  the latest available technology. In addition, the comments pointed out that 
  there is little potential for abuse because Peer Review organizations review 
  virtually every pacemaker implant decision, and because competitive replacement 
  programs put the beneficiary only in the same financial position he or she would 
  be in if he or she purchased a replacement pacemaker from the original manufacturer 
  pursuant to that manufacturer's warranty. 
<p>Response: We generally agree with these comments, but we remain concerned that 
  many of these programs either provide additional incentives beyond the original 
  warranty or impose additional costs on the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For 
  example, while some competitive replacement programs replace the item, such 
  as a pacemaker, only on the same terms as those in the warranty of the original 
  manufacturer, others replace the item under other conditions as well; while 
  some provide the replacement item free of charge, others provide a discount 
  on the replacement item capped at a specified dollar amount; and while some 
  make no payments for medical expenses, others assist patients (either directly 
  or by paying the health care provider) with their unreimbursed medical expenses 
  up to a specified dollar amount. Depending on the original manufacturer's warranty, 
  some of these programs do much more than merely put the beneficiary in the same 
  position he or she would be in if he or she bought a replacement item from the 
  original manufacturer under the terms of that warranty. 
<p>We believe that safe harbor protection is proper where a replacement program 
  honors the original manufacturer's warranty, which qualifies by itself under 
  this provision, and the agreement provides remuneration on the same terms as 
  the original manufacturer's warranty without providing additional incentives 
  or shifting additional costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under such 
  programs, any incentive to replace a product under warranty stems from the original 
  warranty, and not from the competitive replacement agreement. 
<p>We remain concerned about potential abuse in one additional area. Some competitive 
  replacement agreements pay the health care provider or practitioner directly 
  for the beneficiary's medical expenses. We believe that such direct payments 
  are potentially abusive because the health care provider or practitioner knows 
  that the warranty insures against beneficiaries' bad debts. Thus, we are adding 
  paragraph (g)(4) so that safe harbor protection is not provided when payments 
  are made to any health care provider (such as a hospital or ASC) for expenses 
  such as medical, surgical or hospital expenses incurred by the beneficiary. 
  Payments made to the health care provider or practitioner for the item itself, 
  or price reductions on that item, are protected. 
<p>Comment: One commenter suggested that the OIG should provide safe harbor protection 
  for payments made by manufacturers or suppliers to settle claims or to satisfy 
  judgments arising out of product liability claims regardless of whether such 
  payments were included in the warranty at the time of the original sale of the 
  item. 
<p>Response: Where such payments are not part of a warranty made at the time of 
  the original sale of an item, they do not appear to be intended to induce the 
  purchase of that item, and hence are not covered by the statute. Where such 
  payments are included in a warranty given at the time of sale, they would only 
  be protected if they were made as part of a warranty that complied with this 
  provision. 
<p>Comment: One commenter suggested that the OIG should not provide safe harbor 
  protection for middlemen suppliers that expand the protection afforded by the 
  manufacturer' s warranty. 
<p>Response: We believe that warranties generally benefit consumers as well as 
  the Medicare and Medicaid program, even though they may constitute a technical 
  violation of the statute. As long as a supplier acting as a middleman wholesaler 
  complies with this safe harbor provision, we fail to see the harm when it provides 
  greater benefits than those provided by the manufacturer. Such expanded warranties 
  are commonly provided by middlemen in industries other than health care, for 
  example, by automobile dealers, and we believe such expanded warranties should 
  be encouraged. 
<p>6. Discounts--&#167; 1001.952(h) 
<p>Comment: A few commenters expressed concern about the meaning of the word "discount." 
  For example, four commenters asked us to clarify whether a discount includes 
  a general price reduction offered across the board to all buyers. One commenter 
  argued that a marketing strategy similar to a warranty, but not falling within 
  that safe harbor provision was, in fact, a discount. 
<p>Response: We believe that this first statutory exception is intended to cover 
  discounts and other price reductions offered by a seller through an arms length 
  transaction to induce a buyer to order or purchase goods (including items) or 
  services for which the discount applies or other goods or services payable under 
  Medicare or Medicaid. A discount typically is the difference in the price at 
  which a good or service is normally sold compared to the price at which it is 
  actually sold when the inducement is given. 
<p>The statutory discount exception applies only to discounts obtained by health 
  care providers who submit claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe 
  that this exception was not intended to cover the offering of discounts by health 
  care providers who submit claims, for example, to beneficiaries as part of a 
  routine waiver program for coinsurance and deductible amounts. We have changed 
  the definition of the term "discount" to clarify the limited scope of this exception. 
  A discussion of the limited safe harbor protection we are providing for routine 
  waivers is found in section III.B.4. In addition, as discussed in section III.B.3., 
  price reductions negotiated by HMOs, preferred provider organizations and other 
  health care plans to protect such discounted fee arrangements are expected to 
  be addressed at a later date in a separate interim final rule. 
<p>We believe discounts are distinct from across-the-board price reductions offered 
  to all buyers where the inducement that is made is so diffuse that it does not 
  appear intended to encourage a particular buyer to purchase or order a particular 
  good or service payable under Medicare or Medicaid. 
<p>In addition, we believe that Congress did not intend for this discount exception 
  to apply to price reductions offered to one payor but not to Medicare or Medicaid. 
  For example, we are aware of cases where laboratories offer a discount to physicians 
  who then bill the patient, but do not offer the same discount to the Medicare 
  program. In some of these cases, the discount offered to the physician is explicitly 
  conditioned on the physician's referral of all of his or her laboratory business. 
  Such a "discount" does not benefit Medicare, and is therefore inconsistent with 
  the statutory intent for discounts to be reported to the programs with costs 
  and charges reduced appropriately to reflect the discounts. 
<p>Another problem exists when an entity, which is both a provider or supplier 
  of items or services and a joint venture partner with referring physicians, 
  makes discounts to the joint venture as a way to share its profits with the 
  physician partners. Very often this entity furnishes items or services to the 
  joint venture, and also acts as the joint venture's general partner or provides 
  management services to the joint venture. For example, in some cases a reference 
  laboratory performs testing for another laboratory at a discount price in accordance 
  with a management contract. In other cases, the services the reference laboratory 
  provides are paid on the basis of a percentage of revenues that the joint<strong> 
  </strong>venture receives from Medicare. These arrangements are not arms length 
  transactions where the joint venture entity shops around for the best price 
  on a good or service. Rather, it has entered into a collusive arrangement with 
  a particular provider or supplier of items or services that seeks to share its 
  profits with referring physician partners. To clarify that we do not intend 
  to protect these types of transactions which are sometimes made to appear as 
  "discounts," we are clarifying the definition of "discounts" in paragraph (h)(3) 
  of this section to permit only transactions made on an arms length basis. 
<p>Since many of these illegal transactions are made as part of personal services 
  or management contracts, we are clarifying the definition of "discounts" to 
  preclude discounts made as part of such transactions. We are making this revision 
  for the additional reason that Congress did not intend to exempt such arrangements 
  merely because those services were provided at a "discount." Since we believe 
  that contracts for personal or management services do not fit within the ambit 
  of the statutory discount exception, such arrangements must be analyzed under 
  the respective safe harbor provision for those contracts. Of course, to the 
  extent that the failure to report the actual price of the management contract 
  implicates the civil monetary penalties law (section 1128A of the Act) liability 
  may be imposed under that statute. 
<p>With respect to warranties, as we discussed in the warranty section immediately 
  above, warranties are not discounts. Therefore to provide clearer guidance, 
  we have modified the definition of the term "discount" in paragraph (h)(3) to 
  exclude warranties and other examples of arrangements that do not constitute 
  "discounts." 
<p>Comment: Many commenters urged the OIG to expand this safe harbor provision 
  to include a variety of other discounting practices where the benefit received 
  relates to something other than the specific good or service purchased or provided. 
  Examples of the suggested permissible arrangements include bundled goods closely 
  related to the purchased goods, such as free "surgical packs" (including such 
  items as sutures, Healon, viscoelastics, and disposable gloves provided with 
  purchases of intraocular lenses (IOLs), or credits toward free computers or 
  other items that are useful in a physician's practice. 
<p>Response: We believe that such an interpretation goes well beyond the legislative 
  intent of this statutory exception, and vitiates its purpose. We believe that 
  Congress did not intend to include within this provision the practice of a seller 
  giving away, or reducing the price of, one good in connection with the purchase 
  of a different good. Such arrangements, for the most part, do not represent 
  price reductions where the value of the goods received can be measured and fully 
  reported to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>Although there are many instances where these practices are cost effective 
  arrangements that benefit the health care provider, there is enormous potential 
  for abuse. One of the most common features of a serious kickback violation exists 
  when a seller offers a valuable good, for example a car or a trip, to a person 
  in return for that person's participation in activity prohibited under the statute, 
  for example, referral of business payable by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
  Thus, these commenters, while pointing to some potentially beneficial arrangements, 
  are asking us to permit a broad class of arrangements that would include acts 
  which have resulted in criminal convictions and at least one pending criminal 
  prosecution. <em>See e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Bay State Ambulance and 
  Hospital Rental Service, Inc., supra.</em> 
<p>Even where the particular item that is being given away may result in a more 
  effective means of delivering the supplies to the health care provider, these 
  types of "discounts" cause problems because they often shift costs among reimbursement 
  systems or distort the true costs of all the items. As a result, it may be difficult 
  for the Medicare and Medicaid programs to determine the proper reimbursement 
  levels. 
<p>For example, in developing accurate pricing data to assist HCFA in setting 
  the amount of reimbursement for IOLs, we found that bundled pricing arrangements 
  similar to those suggested by our commenters were common, and made it difficult 
  to determine the true acquisition cost of IOLs. (See Medicare certified Ambulatory 
  Surgical Centers, Cataract Surgery Costs and Related Issues, at 9- 12, March 
  1988, OAI-09-88-00490.) In addition, HCFA determined that its IOL pricing data 
  obtained from the ASCs "revealed significant inconsistencies in reporting net 
  IOL costs." 53 FR 31476. The necessity of accurately reporting the true acquisition 
  costs of IOLs undistorted by bundling arrangements is underscored by HCFA's 
  stated policy in its final rule promulgating a $200 add- on rate: "to continue 
  to collect data on IOL acquisition costs and purchasing arrangements to ensure 
  that the IOL rate appropriately reflects lens acquisition costs." 55 FR 436. 
<p>Finally, this practice of bundling IOLs with other goods is of sufficient seriousness 
  that it is the subject of at least one pending criminal prosecution. 
<p>For these reasons, we decline to broaden the scope of this provision to include 
  discounts on bundled goods and have clarified the definition of the term "discount" 
  to specifically exclude such arrangements. Of course, where discounts are offered 
  on goods that are unbundled and the discount otherwise complies with the rules 
  of this provision, safe harbor protection is granted. 
<p>For purchasing practices involving the free provision of another type of item, 
  we will examine the surrounding circumstances to determine the desirability 
  of prosecuting that arrangement. Examples of potential factors which we may 
  consider include: (1) The amount of the benefit that was reported and passed 
  along to the programs, (2) whether the good is separately reimbursable, and 
  (3) the intent behind the arrangement. 
<p>A related issue is the practice of giving away free computers. In some cases 
  the computer can only be used as part of a particular service that is being 
  provided, for example, printing out the results of laboratory tests. In this 
  situation, it appears that the computer has no independent value apart from 
  the service that is being provided and that the purpose of the free computer 
  is not to induce an act prohibited by the statute. Rather, the computer is part 
  of a package of services provided at a price that can be accurately reported 
  to the programs. In contrast, sometimes the computer that is given away is a 
  regular personal computer, which the physician is free to use for a variety 
  of purposes in addition to receiving test results. In that situation the computer 
  has a definite value to the physician, and, depending on the circumstances, 
  may well constitute an illegal inducement. 
<p>Comment: A large number of commenters urged the OIG to broaden this safe harbor 
  provision to include other reductions in price, such as "rebates" and "credits." 
  These commenters argued that such programs are equivalent to price reductions 
  and are capable of being properly reported. 
<p>Response: We generally agree with the thrust of these comments and have revised 
  the definition of discount in paragraph (h)(3) to protect rebate checks, redeemable 
  coupons and credits, subject to the following conditions. First, because of 
  our continued concern about the potential for improper use of redeemable coupons, 
  we are limiting the ability of recipients of such discounts to negotiate these 
  instruments to third parties. As revised, this provision requires these instruments 
  to be redeemed only by the seller. Second, the rebate check, redeemable coupon, 
  or credit can only be applied to the same good or service that was purchased 
  or provided. Thus, a redeemable coupon or credit obtained on the purchase of 
  one good cannot be used toward the purchase of a different good. Third, like 
  other discounts covered under this provision, these forms of discounts must 
  be fully and accurately reported. Finally, except as noted below, such discounts 
  must be given at the time the good or service was purchased or provided. 
<p>The reporting of credits presents an unusual situation because the monetary 
  value of the credit only applies to future purchases of goods or services. Thus, 
  to comply with this provision, the buyer must report the credits on the applicable 
  cost report or claim form covering the goods or services for which the credit 
  is being used. 
<p>Comment: A large number of commenters urged the OIG to expand this safe harbor 
  provision to include other types of discount mechanisms where the value of the 
  discount is not calculated until after some period of time has passed. Examples 
  of such a discount mechanism include end-of-year discounts and prompt pay discounts. 
  These commenters believed that these discounting mechanisms encourage legitimate, 
  beneficial business practices that do not harm the program. In addition, many 
  commenters pointed out that such discounting practices have long been encouraged 
  through HCFA's prudent buyer guidelines. (Provider Reimbursement Manual, part 
  I section 2103, HCFA Pub. No. 15-1) 
<p>Response: We recognize that there are many legitimate discount programs where 
  the value of the discount is only reported after the good is purchased or the 
  service is provided. Unfortunately, due to the nature of some reimbursement 
  systems, it is sometimes not possible to determine retrospectively how much 
  such discounts reduce the price of the goods or services previously purchased 
  or provided. For example, it would be virtually impossible to take the numerous 
  claims for cataract surgery submitted by a physician in a given year and determine 
  the true acquisition cost of an IOL provided to that physician when the discount 
  is only calculated at year end. Thus, paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, 
  which governs discounts on items and services paid on the basis of charges or 
  acquisition costs, does not permit end-of-year discounts. On the other hand, 
  where the Department or a State agency requires a health care provider to maintain 
  cost reports (including HMOs, CMPs and health care prepayment plans (HCPPs pursuant 
  to agreements under sections 1876(h) or 1833 of the Act), we believe that end 
  of year calculations of discounts on purchases of the same good or service can 
  be fully and accurately reported, as well as those discounts obtained at the 
  time of the purchase. 
<p>Therefore, we are revising this provision in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section 
  (which applies only to cost report providers) to protect such end- of-year discounts 
  when all of the following conditions are met. One, end-of- year discounts can 
  only be calculated based on purchases of the same good or service in a single 
  fiscal year. Of course, the discount may be obtained at the time of purchase 
  as well. Two, the entity must claim the benefit of the discount from the seller 
  in the fiscal year in which the discount is earned or the following year. In 
  many cases, a seller will be able to calculate the amount of the discount and 
  give the buyer the benefit of the discount (for example, in a credit or reduced 
  price on future purchases of that same good) in the same fiscal year in which 
  the credit was earned. However, in many other cases, the seller may take several 
  weeks after the end of a fiscal year to give the buyer the necessary information. 
  Under either circumstance, this prong of the safe harbor is satisfied. Three, 
  the buyer must fully and accurately report the discount in the cost report for 
  the fiscal year in which the benefit of the discount is received. And four, 
  if the Secretary or a State Medicaid agency requests information, the buyer 
  must provide the appropriate invoices from the seller. (See discussion below 
  of seller's separate reporting requirements.) 
<p>We believe that this revision complies with the most important statutory requirement 
  of the discount exception--full reporting--and accommodates many of these end-of-year 
  discounting programs. In addition, we believe that this revision is consistent 
  with HCFA's prudent buyer rules, which are not applicable to charge-based health 
  care providers. 
<p>With respect to prompt pay discounts, we have made no change to include such 
  discount arrangements. No change is necessary because, by definition, they are 
  designed to induce prompt payment, and thus do not appear to violate the statute. 
  Of course, we will continue to scrutinize closely "prompt pay" discounts to 
  make sure that they are not payments made for an illegal purpose cloaked under 
  a legitimate label. 
<p>Comment: Three commenters requested the OIG to provide various kinds of special 
  treatment for HMOs and PPOs. For example, one commenter urged the OIG to broaden 
  this provision as it applies to HMOs to permit cash grants and training assistance. 
  Another commenter urged the OIG to change the definition of discount to permit 
  discounts offered to HMOs and PPOs by contract health care providers. 
<p>Response: We recognize that HMOs and CMPs paid in accordance with a risk contract 
  with HCFA or a State health care program deserve special attention, and paragraph 
  (h)(1)(ii) follows the proposed rule recognizing their special status. These 
  HMOs and CMPs need not report discounts they receive except as may otherwise 
  be required under their risk contract. 
<p>In addition, we have expanded this provision in significant ways that should 
  be of assistance to all health care providers, including HMOs. However, we do 
  not believe that it would be appropriate to provide special safe harbor protection 
  for purchasing arrangements that go beyond the intended purpose of this statutory 
  exception. As with all arrangements that drift from a safe harbor out to sea, 
  we will examine them on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the statute 
  has been violated in such a way as to warrant prosecution. 
<p>With respect to discounts offered to HMOs, CMPs and PPOs by contract health 
  care providers, as discussed in section III.B.3. above, we are expecting to 
  promulgate a new interim final safe harbor provision to protect arrangements 
  between these parties for the furnishing of covered items and services to beneficiaries 
  where certain standards are met. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters objected on a variety of grounds to the requirement 
  that charge-based health care providers reduce their charges by the full amount 
  of the discount. These commenters pointed out that historically the Medicare 
  program has not sought to regulate the discrete components that make up a particular 
  charge. In addition, many suggested that the OIG will destroy the incentive 
  of obtaining discounts if it requires health care providers to pass along the 
  full amount of the discount to the programs. Another rationale for suggesting 
  a change in this safe harbor provision is that the OIG should treat cost and 
  charge-based health care providers in the same manner, and because this safe 
  harbor provision does not require a reduction in reported costs for cost-based 
  health care providers, no parallel requirement should be placed on charge-based 
  health care providers. 
<p>Response: We agree with the thrust of these comments, and are revising paragraph 
  (h)(1)(iii) of this safe harbor provision to delete the requirement that charge-based 
  health care providers reduce their charges by the full amount of the discount. 
  Such a provision would be largely unenforceable. As many commenters pointed 
  out, the Department has never monitored the various input costs that make up 
  a health care provider's charge. Therefore, we are not in a position to know 
  a health care provider's base from which he or she was reducing the charge. 
  Thus, for example, if a physician receives a discount as defined in this provision 
  valued at $4 per service, the physician could argue that he or she is not required 
  to reduce the charge by that amount because other costs included in that charge 
  had increased to offset the $4 discount. We are generally not in a position 
  to prove otherwise. 
<p>Although we continue to believe that individuals and entities have an obligation 
  to pass along to the Medicare and Medicaid programs the value of discounts they 
  receive, we believe that the actual savings that would result from requiring 
  such charge reductions would be offset by the cost of enforcement. In many areas 
  of reimbursement, for example, physician or laboratory services and purchases 
  of IOLs, Congress has steadily moved away from charge-based reimbursement or 
  has imposed limitations on charges. We believe that those statutory reforms 
  are better suited to address the problem of excessive charging practices. Nonetheless, 
  even though we are deleting this requirement for the purposes of this safe harbor 
  provision, we strongly encourage charge-based health care providers to pass 
  along discounts to the programs. 
<p>With respect to the different treatment of health care providers based on the 
  type of reimbursement system, we believe that reasonable safe harbor rules for 
  discounts must be closely tailored to the various reimbursement principles and 
  cost reporting mechanisms. Just as we believe it is appropriate to treat HMOs 
  reimbursed on a capitated basis differently from other health care providers, 
  we now believe that it is appropriate to treat charge-based health care providers 
  differently from cost-based health care providers for the purposes of requiring 
  the discount to be passed along to the program. Such an approach is far preferable 
  than a blind adherence to uniform treatment of health care providers. We believe 
  that such a position is a reasonable reading of the statutory requirement that 
  "the reduction in price [be] * * * appropriately reflected in the costs claimed 
  or charges made by the provider or entity * * *." (Section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of 
  the Act.) <br>
  <br>
<p>We emphasize, however, that paragraph (h)(1)(iii) still requires charge-based 
  health care providers to comply with the respective rules regarding full and 
  accurate reporting of discounts as defined in this provision. This reporting 
  requirement is limited to items or services that are separately claimed as a 
  line item for payment with the Department or a State agency. As discussed below, 
  under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, we will not require health care 
  providers to report discounts they receive on goods purchased for which a line 
  item charge is not separately made, but rather is included within their professional 
  charge. 
<p>In addition, we note that some commenters were confused about the requirements 
  we are placing on health care providers reimbursed on the basis of costs. The 
  regulation need not specify that a health care provider must separately reduce 
  its cost by the amount of the discount because the cost reporting requirements 
  accomplish the statutory purpose of having the amount of the discount "appropriately 
  reflected in the costs claimed." Whether a provider submits cost reports (and 
  complies with paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section) or submits a seller's invoice 
  to demonstrate its acquisition costs (and complies with paragraph (h)(1)(iii) 
  of this section), the amount of the discount is passed along to the Medicare 
  and Medicaid programs. As a result, this revised discount provision treats items 
  and services reimbursed on the basis of charges differently from those reimbursed 
  on the basis of costs, because costs will be reduced by the amounts of discounts 
  whereas charges will not be affected. 
<p>Finally, although we have attempted to tailor this discount provision to make 
  sense within the context of the varying reimbursement rules, as we have explained 
  in section III.A. above, compliance with this safe harbor provision in no way 
  affects Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rules. 
<p>Comment: Five commenters discussed the requirement in the proposed rule that 
  the discount appear on the seller's invoice or statement and the consequent 
  liability of the seller for failing to make such disclosure. They questioned 
  the apparent inconsistency with the preamble to the proposed rule that no requirements 
  need be placed on sellers in order for their discounts to qualify under this 
  exemption. 
<p>Response: We agree with the comments that we should clarify the requirement 
  for a seller to report the value of the discount on the invoice or statement 
  provided to a purchaser, and we are modifying this provision in paragraph (h)(2) 
  accordingly. As discussed above, such standards are necessary to assist the 
  Department and State agencies in verifying that the buyer has fully and accurately 
  reported the value of the discount. 
<p>This paragraph describes the requirements we are placing on sellers. With respect 
  to those who sell goods or services to risk contract HMOs and CMPs at a discount, 
  paragraph (h)(2)(i) makes clear that the seller is under no obligation to report 
  the discount to the HMO or CMP for purposes of this safe harbor. Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) 
  sets out the seller's requirements with respect to its sales to all other health 
  care providers. It must either fully and accurately report the discount on the 
  invoice or statement. In addition, it must inform the buyer of its obligations 
  under paragraph (h)(1). With respect to permissible end-of-year discounts, this 
  paragraph, as revised, requires the seller's invoice or statement to show clearly 
  the existence of a discount program, and the seller must inform the buyer of 
  its obligations under paragraph (h)(1). The seller is also required to provide 
  the buyer with a separate document, such as a reconciliation statement, showing 
  the calculation of the discount and identifying the specific goods or services 
  purchased to which the discount is attributed. 
<p>It was our original intent not to hold sellers liable for the reporting omissions 
  of health care providers, and we believe such a policy remains appropriate. 
  However, we agree with the commenters that some rules should apply to sellers. 
  We believe that the limited conditions we are placing on sellers seeking safe 
  harbor protection will not place an undue burden on them, but are sufficient 
  to prevent them from avoiding liability when they engage in unlawful schemes 
  disguised as discounts. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters questioned what information must be reported to the 
  program and the methods to be used in reporting such information. Among the 
  questions that were asked is whether the list price, discount, and final actual 
  price all need to be reported on the invoice, claim, or statement. In addition, 
  many commenters suggested that it was unrealistic to require practitioners to 
  report all discounts on goods they purchase, such as office supplies and surgical 
  gloves, for which they do not charge separately, but rather include within their 
  professional service charge. 
<p>Response: The fundamental test for complying with the reporting requirement 
  is whether the actual purchase price net of any discount is fully and accurately 
  reported by the seller on the invoice or statement (or, where applicable for 
  end-of-year discounts, on a reconciliation statement) and by the purchaser on 
  the claim or request for payment submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. We do not 
  necessarily require all the information in the calculation of the discount to 
  be noted specifically on the invoice, statement, claim or request for payment; 
  rather, a notation may be made that the actual purchase price is "net discount." 
  Such reporting is acceptable for the purpose of satisfying this provision. 
<p>We agree that no purpose would be accomplished if we were to require practitioners 
  to report the discounts they receive on office supplies where there is no requirement 
  to separately report the item on which the discount is received. Thus, we are 
  clarifying the requirements for reporting discounts under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) 
  of this section to make clear that where a practitioner obtains a discount, 
  defined in this provision, for a good that is included as part of his or her 
  professional service charge, such discounts need not be reported. Where a practitioner, 
  however, purchases an item or service at a discount and such item or service 
  is separately claimed as a line item on the applicable claim form, the discounted 
  price must be fully and accurately reported. For example, where a surgeon performs 
  cataract surgery in his or her office and implants an intraocular lens (IOL), 
  the surgeon must report any discount received on the price of the IOL. 
<p>Finally, it is noted that where the discount in question does not qualify as 
  a discount under this provision, no safe harbor protection applies. For example, 
  as we stated above, we are not expanding this safe harbor provision to protect 
  the offering of a free good different from the one that is being purchased. 
  Thus, consistent with that position, we are not willing to protect the offering 
  of free computers even when named as "office supplies" to induce the purchase 
  of other items that are reimbursable separately. 
<p>7. Employees--&#167; 1001.952(i) 
<p>Comment: Many commenters urged the OIG to extend this exception to apply to 
  independent contractors paid on a commission basis. Two commenters asserted 
  that the legislative history of the statute makes clear that Congress intended 
  to include independent contractors in the employee exception. In support of 
  this contention, they quoted remarks made by Representative Rostenkowski when 
  the House was considering the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments 
  of 1977. (123 Cong. Rec. 30,280 (1977)) 
<p>Response: We continue to reject this approach because of the existence of widespread 
  abusive practices by salespersons who are independent contractors and, therefore, 
  who are not under appropriate supervision and control. Although two commenters 
  asserted that they could achieve appropriate supervision and control of independent 
  contractors by including restrictive terms in the contract, we cannot expand 
  this provision to cover such relationships unless we can predict with reasonable 
  certainty that they will not be abusive. We are confident that the employer-employee 
  relationship is unlikely to be abusive, in part because the employer is generally 
  fully liable for the actions of its employees and is therefore more motivated 
  to supervise and control them. 
<p>Furthermore, we believe that Representative Rostenkowski's remarks do not reflect 
  congressional intent in this case. His comments related to the House version 
  of the employee exception that was rejected by the Conference Committee. Instead, 
  Congress passed the Senate version, which expressly limited the exception to 
  bona fide employment relationships (See H.Conf.Rep. No. 673, 95th Cong., 1st 
  Sess. 41 (1977)). Consequently, we find no support for the position that Congress 
  intended to cover independent contractors under this exception. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters questioned the wisdom of the employee exception, stating 
  that health care providers should not be able to refer patients to other health 
  care providers within their own offices because abuse could be worse than when 
  individuals or entities make referrals to outside sources. 
<p>Response: The exception for bona fide employment relationships is clear on 
  the face of the statute, and we are not free to ignore that statutory mandate. 
<p>Comment: One commenter asserted that we do not have the statutory authority 
  to limit the definition of "employee" to the meaning it has under 26 U.S.C. 
  3121(d)(2). 
<p>Response: As we have discussed, Congress expressly limited the scope of the 
  employee exception to "bona fide employment relationship[s]" between an employer 
  and an employee. The Secretary clearly has the power, and indeed the duty, to 
  establish the criteria for a bona fide employment relationship. The Internal 
  Revenue Service's (IRS) definition of employee is a longstanding one that has 
  been developed by both agency and court rulings. Furthermore, this definition 
  is sufficiently narrow that it excludes certain types of relationships that 
  we believe tend to be associated with violations of the statute. We are clarifying 
  this safe harbor provision to make clear that the meaning of the term "employee" 
  is defined not only by 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2) itself, but also by the IRS's interpretation 
  of that provision as codified in its regulations and other interpretive sources. 
<p>Comment: One commenter inquired whether a part-time employee paid on a commission-only 
  basis falls within the employee exception. 
<p>Response: As long as a bona fide employer-employee relationship exists between 
  the part-time employee and the employer, such a relationship falls within the 
  scope of this provision. 
<p>Comment: Some commenters asserted that many legitimate employment relationships 
  that are common in the health care industry are not protected from prosecution 
  under this exception. One commenter suggested that the employee exception include 
  independent contractors where beneficiaries are being induced to participate 
  in cost-containment programs because such programs are beneficial to Medicare 
  and State health care programs, and therefore should be protected. 
<p>Response: We recognize that this provision does not cover some types of personal 
  service arrangements, but our position is necessary to protect the program from 
  abuse to a reasonable degree. However, many of these other arrangements could 
  be protected under the personal services and management contracts safe harbor 
  provision. 
<p>Comment: One commenter stated that hospitals are often compelled by State "corporate 
  practice of medicine" requirements to employ physicians and other health care 
  personnel as independent contractors, and that these employment relationships 
  should be afforded safe harbor protection. 
<p>Response: We understand that there may be circumstances where, because of State 
  laws, health care providers may<strong> </strong>not be able to enter into arrangements 
  with health care personnel that comply with the IRS definition of employee. 
  In such cases, however, health care providers may obtain protection for payments 
  from these arrangements by drafting their personal contracts to satisfy the 
  safe harbor provision for personal services and management contracts. 
<p>8. Group Purchasing Organizations--&#167; 1001.952(j) 
<p>Comment: One commenter urged the OIG to further define what constitutes a group 
  purchasing organization (GPO) for purposes of this provision. This commenter 
  specifically questioned whether a nursing home chain that requested percentage 
  payments from laboratories as "GPO fees" in return for the referral of laboratory 
  services from member nursing homes fit this definition. 
<p>Response: As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, this exception applies 
  to payments made by a vendor of goods or services to a person authorized to 
  act on behalf of a group of individuals or entities who are furnishing Medicare 
  or Medicaid services. Our definition of the term "GPO" makes clear that a nursing 
  home chain requesting fees for referrals would not qualify for this safe harbor 
  because a chain of nursing homes that are wholly owned subsidiaries of a single 
  corporate entity for all practical purposes constitutes a single entity and 
  not a "group" of entities. As we discuss in section III.D. below, because of 
  the special relationship wholly-owned subsidiaries have with their parent corporation, 
  we are considering separate protection for payments between these entities. 
  However, following this reasoning, we do not believe it appropriate for a nursing 
  home chain to qualify as a GPO and request "GPO fees" for referrals. If a nursing 
  home directly requested such a fee it would appear to represent an illegal inducement. 
  We see no reason how such a solicitation sanitizes the illegality when it is 
  made indirectly by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the nursing home, instead of 
  directly by the nursing home itself. 
<p>In addition, we believe that Congress did not intend this exception to apply 
  where it is the vendor and not the health care provider who is furnishing services 
  and directly billing the Medicare or Medicaid program. For example, in addition 
  to services furnished by the nursing home, other health care providers furnish 
  many part B services to nursing home patients, such as laboratory services and 
  durable medical equipment (DME). We believe that a GPO, acting on behalf of 
  a group of nursing homes, is not serving as a GPO when it receives a "GPO fee" 
  from a laboratory or DME supplier that is supplying goods or services to nursing 
  home patients and billing Medicare or Medicaid directly. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters objected to the requirement that a purchasing agent, 
  i.e., a GPO, have a written agreement with each individual or entity in the 
  group that specifies the amount the agent will be paid by each vendor. This 
  requirement, they asserted, would be burdensome and expensive. 
<p>Response: We agree with the general thrust of these comments and have modified 
  paragraph (j)(1)(ii). The statutory exception requires that written contracts 
  specify the amount the GPO will be paid by the vendor. We believe that this 
  statutory mandate is satisfied if the GPO discloses to a health care provider 
  the fees it will receive from only those vendors that provide goods or services 
  to that provider. This obviates the need for the GPO to divulge fees from vendors 
  that do not provide goods or services to that particular individual or entity. 
<p>Comment: To promote administrative convenience, efficiency, and cost- containment 
  purposes, several commenters requested that the GPO should be permitted to specify 
  the range of fees to be paid by the potential vendors instead of the actual 
  amount. One commenter asserted that because of the varying contracts between 
  GPOs and their vendors, it was impossible to determine and disclose in advance 
  the amount the GPO would receive from its vendors. 
<p>Response: We agree that it is not necessary, in all circumstances, to specify 
  the exact fees the GPO will receive from its vendors as a result of a particular 
  member's purchases. The legislative history to this exception, however, shows 
  Congress's concern for excessive GPO fees, particularly those exceeding 3 percent. 
  (See, H.Conf. Rep. 1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 310-11 (1986)) For this reason, 
  we are revising this provision (see paragraph (j)(1)(i)) so that a GPO needs 
  to specify the administrative fee it is paid from vendors only if any fee will 
  be above 3 percent. 
<p>In the event that the fee cannot be ascertained at the time of the contract 
  or the fee is not fixed at 3 percent or less, the contract must state the maximum 
  amount that could be paid to the GPO by the vendor. This mechanism will permit 
  some flexibility in payments made to the GPO, yet retain the focus on excessive 
  fees about which Congress was concerned. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters questioned the interrelationship of this provision 
  to the discount safe harbor. 
<p>Response: Several commenters appeared confused about the relationship between 
  these two provisions. This is an example of an arrangement where two safe harbor 
  provisions could apply, i.e., one applicable to discounts, and one applicable 
  to GPOs. However, the GPO provision applies only to payments made by a vendor 
  of goods or services to a person authorized to act as a GPO. Payments, such 
  as discounts, made by vendors of goods or services to health care providers 
  must qualify under the discount exception. 
<p>D. Comments on Proposals for New Safe Harbor Provisions 
<p>In sections III.B.3. and III.C.1. we discussed proposals and our responses 
  regarding new safe harbor provisions for negotiated price reductions and investment 
  interests. In this section we discuss the remaining proposals and our responses 
  regarding potential new safe harbors. 
<p>Note: Any discussion below indicating that we are considering a new safe harbor 
  provision should in no way be construed as legalizing the business arrangement 
  at this time. 
<p>Comment: A large number of commenters urged the OIG to adopt a safe harbor 
  provision to protect certain physician recruitment activities. They commented 
  that subsidy payments to physicians for recruitment purposes provide important 
  benefits to many communities that have difficulty in obtaining and retaining 
  physicians. Some urged that we also protect hospital recruitment activities 
  even though a physician does not need to move his or her residence to join the 
  medical staff of the new hospital. Others urged a variety of other provisions, 
  for example, that we not require the physician to disclose to his or her patients 
  the relationship between the physician and the hospital, and that we not specify 
  how long the payments may continue. 
<p>Response: We agree with the need to protect some recruitment activities for 
  physicians and other practitioners, and we are considering a new safe harbor 
  provision for practitioner recruitment that we anticipate publishing as a separate 
  regulation. 
<p>Comment: Three commenters requested the OIG to adopt a safe harbor provision 
  that will protect all payments that subsidize malpractice premiums. These commenters 
  stressed that such payments have an overwhelming public benefit with limited 
  potential for abuse. One of these commenters argued that obstetrician-gynecologists 
  are facing significant difficulty in paying for malpractice insurance, and suggested 
  that many communities are facing a cut-off of obstetrical services as a result. 
<p>Response: We understand the need to assist certain physicians in making malpractice 
  insurance more affordable, and we are considering a new safe harbor provision 
  which we anticipate publishing as a separate regulation, that would protect 
  certain arrangements that subsidize the costs of a practitioner's malpractice 
  insurance premiums where there is no likelihood of abuse. 
<p>Comment: Several commenters asked the OIG to provide a new safe harbor provision 
  to protect different types of cross-referral arrangements where no money is 
  exchanged between the parties, for example, traditional referral patterns between 
  a primary care practitioner and specialist, between a hospital and nursing home, 
  and among practitioners within a group practice. 
<p>Response: We agree that a large majority of these relationships benefit patients 
  by assuring either proper continuity of care or convenient access to a specialist 
  in whom the primary care physician has confidence. Thus, we are considering 
  a new safe harbor provision, that we anticipate publishing as a separate regulation, 
  that would protect many such arrangements where there is no likelihood of abuse. 
<p>Comment: Two commenters suggested that the regulation protect payments related 
  to cooperative hospital service organizations qualified under section 501(e) 
  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under this statute and implementing Internal 
  Revenue Service regulation, these organizations are formed by one or more hospitals 
  (known as "patron-hospitals") to provide specifically enumerated services, such 
  as purchasing, billing, and clinical services solely for the benefit of its 
  patron-hospitals. In addition, these entities are required to distribute "all 
  net earnings to patrons on the basis of services performed." (26 U.S.C. 501(e)(2)) 
  The commenters believed that although such a distribution requirement runs afoul 
  of the anti-kickback statute, the services they perform are beneficial to rural 
  communities in particular, and there has been no indication of abuse by these 
  organizations. 
<p>Response: We agree and are considering a new safe harbor provision, that we 
  anticipate publishing as a separate regulation, that would protect payments 
  between cooperative hospital service organizations and patron-hospitals. 
<p>Comment: Many commenters requested the OIG to clarify that payments between 
  corporations which have common ownership are not subject to the statute. Commenters 
  cited as examples intracorporate discounts and payments between two wholly-owned 
  subsidiaries. Some commenters argued that referral arrangements between two 
  related corporations do not constitute "referrals" within the meaning of the 
  statute, and suggested that the OIG define the word "referral" to exclude such 
  activity. 
<p>Response: We agree that much of the activity described in these comments is 
  either not covered by the statute or deserves safe harbor protection. We believe 
  that the statute is not implicated when payments are transferred within a single 
  entity, for example, from one division to another. Thus, no explicit safe harbor 
  protection is needed for such payments. 
<p>Because the statute is implicated when payments are made from one entity to 
  another even though the payments are made between entities with common ownership, 
  we believe that safe harbor protection may be appropriate. However, we remain 
  concerned about wholly-owned shell entities that are established for a fraudulent 
  purpose, for example, to help hide the identity of the owners or to shield assets. 
  Nonetheless, we are considering a new safe harbor provision, that we anticipate 
  publishing as a separate regulation, that would protect payments between wholly 
  owned subsidiaries and other payments between entities where exclusive ownership 
  control is present and the practice is not otherwise abusive. 
<p>We do not, however, believe that the situations commenters described require 
  us to define the word "referral." The commenters do not appear concerned with 
  any unusual conduct that warrants special attention. Rather the commenters have 
  focused on the source and recipient of the payment in question. Thus, our consideration 
  in any proposed rule will be focused on the relationship of the parties making 
  and receiving payments. 
<p>IV. Additional Information 
<p>A. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<p>Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a final regulatory 
  impact analysis for any regulation that meets one of the Executive Order criteria 
  for a "major rule," that is, that which would be likely to result in (1) an 
  annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in 
  costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, State, or local 
  government agencies or geographic regions; or, (3) significant adverse effects 
  on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the 
  ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises 
  in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory 
  flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
  (5 U.S.C. 601-612), unless the Secretary certifies that a final regulation would 
  not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<p>In the proposed rule published on January 23, 1989, we indicated that this 
  provision was designed to specify the various business and payment practices 
  that would not be considered a kickback for purposes of criminal or civil remedies, 
  and served to clarify departmental policy as to the legality of various commercial 
  arrangements. We stated that the great majority of health care providers and 
  practitioners do not engage in illegal remuneration schemes, and that the aggregate 
  economic impact of this provision should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only 
  those who have chosen to engage in prohibited payment schemes in violation of 
  the statutory intent. As indicated in the proposed regulation's impact statement, 
  the rulemaking is a result of a statutory requirement and not a Department initiative. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>The two comments we received on the cost impact indicated that the safe harbors 
  for discounts and personnel services contracts would cast a cloud over a substantial 
  number of legitimate business practices and existing contractual arrangements. 
  Both commenters believed that a comprehensive regulatory flexibility analysis 
  should be performed and a statement added disclosing the possible financial 
  impact of this rulemaking. 
<p>Consistent with the intent of the statute, this regulation has been designed 
  to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business practices and 
  arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and economy. However, the 
  regulation imposes no requirements on anyone. Health care providers and others 
  may voluntarily seek to comply with these provisions so that they have the assurance 
  that their business practices are not subject to any enforcement action under 
  the anti-kickback statute. Thus, it is impossible to predict how<strong> </strong>many 
  individuals and entities will be affected by this regulation. For these reasons, 
  we have determined that a regulatory impact analysis is not required. Further 
  we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not 
  have a significant economic impact on a number of small business entities, and 
  we have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<p>The following payment practices shall not be treated as a criminal offense 
  under section 1128B of the Act and shall not serve as the basis for an exclusion: 
<p>(a) Investment Interests. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include any payment that is a return on an investment interest, such 
  as a dividend or interest income, made to an investor as long as all of the 
  applicable standards are met within one of the following two categories of entities: 
<p>(1) If, within the previous fiscal year or previous 12 month period, the entity 
  possesses more than $50,000,000 in undepreciated net tangible assets (based 
  on the net acquisition cost of purchasing such assets from an unrelated entity) 
  related to the furnishing of items and services, all of the following five applicable 
  standards must be met-- 
<p>(i) With respect to an investment interest that is an equity security, the 
  equity security must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
  under 15 U.S.C. 78l(b) or (g). 
<p>(ii) The investment interest of an investor in a position to make or influence 
  referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for 
  the entity must be obtained on terms equally available to the public through 
  trading on a registered national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock 
  Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or on the National Association of Securities 
  Dealers Automated Quotation System. 
<p>(iii) The entity or any investor must not market or furnish the entity's items 
  or services (or those of another entity as part of a cross referral agreement) 
  to passive investors differently than to non-investors. 
<p>(iv) The entity must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an investor 
  who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services 
  to, or otherwise generate business for the entity if the investor uses any part 
  of such loan to obtain the investment interest. 
<p>(v) The amount of payment to an investor in return for the investment interest 
  must be directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment of that 
  investor. 
<p>(2) If the entity possesses investment interests that are held by either active 
  or passive investors, all of the following eight applicable standards must be 
  met-- 
<p>(i) No more than 40 percent of the value of the investment interests of each 
  class of investments may be held in the previous fiscal year or previous 12 
  month period by investors who are in a position to make or influence referrals 
  to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity. 
<p>(ii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to a passive investor, 
  if any, who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items 
  or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity must be no different 
  from the terms offered to other passive investors. 
<p>(iii) The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an investor who 
  is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services 
  to, or otherwise generate business for the entity must not be related to the 
  previous or expected volume of referrals, items or services furnished, or the 
  amount of business otherwise generated from that investor to the entity. <br>
  <br>
<p>(iv) There is no requirement that a passive investor, if any, make referrals 
  to, be in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services 
  to, or otherwise generate business for the entity as a condition for remaining 
  as an investor. 
<p>(v) The entity or any investor must not market or furnish the entity's items 
  or services (or those of another entity as part of a cross referral agreement) 
  to passive investors differently than to non-investors. 
<p>(vi) No more than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the entity in the previous 
  fiscal year or previous 12 month period may come from referrals, items or services 
  furnished, or business otherwise generated from investors. 
<p>(vii) The entity must not loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an investor 
  who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services 
  to, or otherwise generate business for the entity if the investor uses any part 
  of such loan to obtain the investment interest. 
<p>(viii) The amount of payment to an investor in return for the investment interest 
  must be directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment (including 
  the fair market value of any pre-operational services rendered) of that investor. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following terms apply. Active 
  investor means an investor either who is responsible for the day-to-day management 
  of the entity and is a bona fide general partner in a partnership under the 
  Uniform Partnership Act or who agrees in writing to undertake liability for 
  the actions of the entity's agents acting within the scope of their agency. 
  Investment interest means a security issued by an entity, and may include the 
  following classes of investments: Shares in a corporation, interests or units 
  of a partnership, bonds, debentures, notes, or other debt instruments. Investor 
  means an individual or entity either who directly holds an investment interest 
  in an entity, or who holds such investment interest indirectly by, including 
  but not limited to, such means as having a family member hold such investment 
  interest or holding a legal or beneficial interest in another entity (such as 
  a trust or holding company) that holds such investment interest. Passive investor 
  means an investor who is not an active investor, such as a limited partner in 
  a partnership under the Uniform Partnership Act, a shareholder in a corporation, 
  or a holder of a debt security. 
<p>(b) Space Rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not include any payment made by a lessee to a lessor for the use of premises, 
  as long as all of the following five standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties. 
<p>(2) The lease specifies the premises covered by the lease. 
<p>(3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with access to the premises 
  for periodic intervals of time, rather than on a full-time basis for the term 
  of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their 
  precise length, and the exact rent for such intervals. 
<p>(4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year. 
<p>(5) The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent with fair 
  market value in arms-length transactions and is not determined in a manner that 
  takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise 
  generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part 
  under Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term fair market value means 
  the value of the rental property for general commercial purposes, but shall 
  not be adjusted to reflect the additional value that one party (either the prospective 
  lessee or lessor) would attribute to the property as a result of its proximity 
  or convenience to sources of referrals or business otherwise generated for which 
  payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
  program. 
<p>(c) Equipment rental. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not include any payment made by a lessee of equipment to the lessor of the equipment 
  for the use of the equipment, as long as all of the following five standards 
  are met-- 
<p>(1) The lease agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties. 
<p>(2) The lease specifies the equipment covered by the lease. 
<p>(3) If the lease is intended to provide the lessee with use of the equipment 
  for periodic intervals of time, rather than on a full-time basis for the term 
  of the lease, the lease specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their 
  precise length, and the exact rent for such interval. 
<p>(4) The term of the lease is for not less than one year. 
<p>(5) The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent with fair 
  market value in arms-length transactions and is not determined in a manner that 
  takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise 
  generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part 
  under Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term fair market value means 
  the value of the equipment when obtained from a manufacturer or professional 
  distributor, but shall not be adjusted to reflect the additional value one party 
  (either the prospective lessee or lessor) would attribute to the equipment as 
  a result of its proximity or convenience to sources of referrals or business 
  otherwise generated for which payment may be made in whole or in part under 
  Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>(d) Personal services and management contracts. As used in section 1128B of 
  the Act, "remuneration" does not include any payment made by a principal to 
  an agent as compensation for the services of the agent, as long as all of the 
  following six standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The agency agreement is set out in writing and signed by the parties. 
<p>(2) The agency agreement specifies the services to be provided by the agent. 
<p>(3) If the agency agreement is intended to provide for the services of the 
  agent on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time 
  basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement specifies exactly the schedule 
  of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals. 
<p>(4) The term of the agreement is for not less than one year. 
<p>(5) The aggregate compensation paid to the agent over the term of the agreement 
  is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in arms- length transactions 
  and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value 
  of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties for which 
  payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care 
  program. 
<p>(6) The services performed under the agreement do not involve the counseling 
  or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity that violates any State 
  or Federal law. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, an agent of a principal is any 
  person, other than a bona fide employee of the principal, who has an agreement 
  to perform services for, or on behalf of, the principal. 
<p>(e) Sale of practice. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does 
  not include any payment made to a practitioner by another practitioner where 
  the former practitioner is selling his or her practice to the latter practitioner, 
  as long as both of the following two standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The period from the date of the first agreement pertaining to the sale 
  to the completion of the sale is not more than one year. 
<p>(2) The practitioner who is selling his or her practice will not be in a professional 
  position to make referrals to, or otherwise generate business for, the purchasing 
  practitioner for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare 
  or a State health care program after one year from the date of the first agreement 
  pertaining to the sale. 
<p>(f) Referral services. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include any payment or exchange of anything of value between an individual 
  or entity ("participant") and another entity serving as a referral service ("referral 
  service"), as long as all of the following four standards are met-- 
<p>(1) The referral service does not exclude as a participant in the referral 
  service any individual or entity who meets the qualifications for participation. 
<p>(2) Any payment the participant makes to the referral service is assessed equally 
  against and collected equally from all participants, and is only based on the 
  cost of operating the referral service, and not on the volume or value of any 
  referrals to or business otherwise generated by the participants for the referral 
  service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or 
  a State health care program. 
<p>(3) The referral service imposes no requirements on the manner in which the 
  participant provides services to a referred person, except that the referral 
  service may require that the participant charge the person referred at the same 
  rate as it charges other persons not referred by the referral service, or that 
  these services be furnished free of charge or at reduced charge. 
<p>(4) The referral service makes the following five disclosures to each person 
  seeking a referral, with each such disclosure maintained by the referral service 
  in a written record certifying such disclosure and signed by either such person 
  seeking a referral or by the individual making the disclosure on behalf of the 
  referral service-- 
<p>(i) The manner in which it selects the group of participants in the referral 
  service to which it could make a referral; 
<p>(ii) Whether the participant has paid a fee to the referral service; 
<p>(iii) The manner in which it selects a particular participant from this group 
  for that person; 
<p>(iv) The nature of the relationship between the referral service and the group 
  of participants to whom it could make the referral; and 
<p>(v) The nature of any restrictions that would exclude such an individual or 
  entity from continuing as a participant. 
<p>(g) Warranties. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not 
  include any payment or exchange of anything of value under a warranty provided 
  by a manufacturer or supplier of an item to the buyer (such as a health care 
  provider or beneficiary) of the item, as long as the buyer complies with all 
  of the following standards in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section and 
  the manufacturer or supplier complies with all of the following standards in 
  paragraphs (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section-- 
<p>(1) The buyer must fully and accurately report any price reduction of the item 
  (including a free item), which was obtained as part of the warranty, in the 
  applicable cost reporting mechanism or claim for payment filed with the Department 
  or a State agency. 
<p>(2) The buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, 
  information provided by the manufacturer or supplier as specified in paragraph 
  (g)(3) of this section. 
<p>(3) The manufacturer or supplier must comply with either of the following two 
  standards- 
<p>(i) The manufacturer or supplier must fully and accurately report the price 
  reduction of the item (including a free item), which was obtained as part of 
  the warranty, on the invoice or statement submitted to the buyer, and inform 
  the buyer of its obligations under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. 
<p>(ii) Where the amount of the price reduction is not known at the time of sale, 
  the manufacturer or supplier must fully and accurately report the existence 
  of a warranty on the invoice or statement, inform the buyer of its obligations 
  under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, and, when the price reduction 
  becomes known, provide the buyer with documentation of the calculation of the 
  price reduction resulting from the warranty. 
<p>(4) The manufacturer or supplier must not pay any remuneration to any individual 
  (other than a beneficiary) or entity for any medical, surgical, or hospital 
  expense incurred by a beneficiary other than for the cost of the item itself. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the term warranty means either 
  an agreement made in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 2301(6), or 
  a manufacturer's or supplier's agreement to replace another manufacturer's or 
  supplier's defective item (which is covered by an agreement made in accordance 
  with this statutory provision), on terms equal to the agreement that it replaces. 
<p>(h) Discounts. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not 
  include a discount, as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, on a good 
  or service received by a buyer, which submits a claim or request for payment 
  for the good or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under 
  Medicare or a State health care program, from a seller as long as the buyer 
  complies with the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(1) of this section and 
  the seller complies with the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(2) of this 
  section: 
<p>(1) With respect to the following three categories of buyers, the buyer must 
  comply with all of the applicable standards within each category-- 
<p>(i) If the buyer is an entity which reports its costs on a cost report required 
  by the Department or a State agency, it must comply with all of the following 
  four standards-- 
<p>(A) the discount must be earned based on purchases of that same good or service 
  bought within a single fiscal year of the buyer; 
<p>(B) the buyer must claim the benefit of the discount in the fiscal year in 
  which the discount is earned or the following year; 
<p>(C) the buyer must fully and accurately report the discount in the applicable 
  cost report; and 
<p>(D) the buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, 
  information provided by the seller as specified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this 
  section. 
<p>(ii) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance organization or 
  competitive medical plan acting in accordance with a risk contract under section 
  1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under another State health care program, it 
  need not report the discount except as otherwise may be required under the risk 
  contract. 
<p>(iii) If the buyer is not an entity described in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) 
  of this section, it must comply with all of the following three standards-- 
<p>(A) the discount must be made at the time of the original sale of the good 
  or service; 
<p>(B) where an item or service is separately claimed for payment with the Department 
  or a State agency, the buyer must fully and accurately report the discount on 
  that item or service; and 
<p>(C) the buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, 
  information provided by the seller as specified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of 
  this section. 
<p>(2) With respect to either of the following two categories of buyers, the seller 
  must comply with all of the applicable standards within each category-- 
<p>(i) If the buyer is an entity described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, 
  the seller need not report the discount to the buyer for purposes of this provision. 
<p>(ii) If the buyer is any other individual or entity, the seller must comply 
  with either of the following two standards-- 
<p>(A) where a discount is required to be reported to the Department or a State 
  agency under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the seller must fully and<strong> 
  </strong>accurately report such discount on the invoice or statement submitted 
  to the buyer, and inform the buyer of its obligations to report such discount; 
  or 
<p>(B) where the value of the discount is not known at the time of sale, the seller 
  must fully and accurately report the existence of a discount program on the 
  invoice or statement submitted to the buyer, inform the buyer of its obligations 
  under paragraph (h)(1) of this section and, when the value of the discount becomes 
  known, provide the buyer with documentation of the calculation of the discount 
  identifying the specific goods or services purchased to which the discount will 
  be applied. 
<p>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term discount means a reduction in 
  the amount a seller charges a buyer (who buys either directly or through a wholesaler 
  or a group purchasing organization) for a good or service based on an arms length 
  transaction. The term discount may include a rebate check, credit or coupon 
  directly redeemable from the seller only to the extent that such reductions 
  in price are attributable to the original good or service that was purchased 
  or furnished. The term discount does not include-- 
<p>(i) Cash payment; 
<p>(ii) Furnishing one good or service without charge or at a reduced charge in 
  exchange for any agreement to buy a different good or service; 
<p>(iii) A reduction in price applicable to one payor but not to Medicare or a 
  State health care program; 
<p>(iv) A reduction in price offered to a beneficiary (such as a routine reduction 
  or waiver of any coinsurance or deductible amount owed by a program beneficiary); 
<p>(v) Warranties; 
<p>(vi) Services provided in accordance with a personal or management services 
  contract; or 
<p>(vii) Other remuneration in cash or in kind not explicitly described in this 
  paragraph. 
<p>(i) Employees. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not 
  include any amount paid by an employer to an employee, who has a bona fide employment 
  relationship with the employer, for employment in the furnishing of any item 
  or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare 
  or a State health care program. For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, 
  the term employee has the same meaning as it does for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 
  3121(d)(2): 
<p>(j) Group purchasing organizations. As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" 
  does not include any payment by a vendor of goods or services to a group purchasing 
  organization (GPO), as part of an agreement to furnish such goods or services 
  to an individual or entity as long as both of the following two standards are 
  met-- 
<p>(1) The GPO must have a written agreement with each individual or entity, for 
  which items or services are furnished, that provides for either of the following-- 
<p>(i) The agreement states that participating vendors from which the individual 
  or entity will purchase goods or services will pay a fee to the GPO of 3 percent 
  or less of the purchase price of the goods or services provided by that vendor. 
<p>(ii) In the event the fee paid to the GPO is not fixed at 3 percent or less 
  of the purchase price of the goods or services, the agreement specifies the 
  amount (or if not known, the maximum amount) the GPO will be paid by each vendor 
  (where such amount may be a fixed sum or a fixed percentage of the value of 
  purchases made from the vendor by the members of the group under the contract 
  between the vendor and the GPO). 
<p>(2) Where the entity which receives the good or service from the vendor is 
  a health care provider of services, the GPO must disclose in writing to the 
  entity at least annually, and to the Secretary upon request, the amount received 
  from each vendor with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of the entity. 
<p>For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, the term group purchasing organization 
  (GPO) means an entity authorized to act as a purchasing agent for a group of 
  individuals or entities who are furnishing services for which payment may be 
  made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program, and 
  who are neither wholly-owned by the GPO nor subsidiaries of a parent corporation 
  that wholly owns the GPO (either directly or through another wholly-owned entity). 
<p>(k) Waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts. As used in section 
  1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not include any reduction or waiver of 
  a Medicare or a State health care program beneficiary's obligation to pay coinsurance 
  or deductible amounts as long as all of the standards are met within either 
  of the following two categories of health care providers: 
<p>(1) If the coinsurance or deductible amounts are owed to a hospital for inpatient 
  hospital services for which Medicare pays under the prospective payment system, 
  the hospital must comply with all of the following three standards-- 
<p>(i) The hospital must not later claim the amount reduced or waived as a bad 
  debt for payment purposes under Medicare or otherwise shift the burden of the 
  reduction or waiver onto Medicare, a State health care program, other payers, 
  or individuals. 
<p>(ii) The hospital must offer to reduce or waive the coinsurance or deductible 
  amounts without regard to the reason for admission, the length of stay of the 
  beneficiary, or the diagnostic related group for which the claim for Medicare 
  reimbursement is filed. 
<p>(iii) The hospital's offer to reduce or waive the coinsurance or deductible 
  amounts must not be made as part of a price reduction agreement between a hospital 
  and a third-party payor. 
<p>(2) If the coinsurance or deductible amounts are owed by an individual who 
  qualifies for subsidized services under a provision of the Public Health Services 
  Act or under titles V or XIX of the Act to a federally qualified health care 
  center or other health care facility under any Public Health Services Act grant 
  program or under title V of the Act, the health care center or facility may 
  reduce or waive the coinsurance or deductible amounts for items or services 
  for which payment may be made in whole or in part under part B of Medicare or 
  a State health care program.
