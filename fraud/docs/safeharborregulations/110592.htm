<p>Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; Safe Harbors for 
<p>Protecting Health Plans <br>
  <br>
<p>Thursday, November 5, 1992 ( 57 FR 52723) <br>
  <br>
<p><strong></strong>AGENCY: Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS. 
<p>ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comment. 
<p>SUMMARY: In accordance with section 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient 
  and Program Protection Act of 1987, this interim final rule establishes two 
  new safe harbors and amends one existing safe harbor to provide protection for 
  certain health care plans, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred 
  provider organizations. The first new provision protects certain incentives 
  to enrollees (including waiver of coinsurance and deductible amounts) paid by 
  health care plans. The second new provision protects certain negotiated price 
  reduction agreements between health care plans and contract health care providers. 
  Finally, an existing safe harbor has been amended to protect certain agreements 
  entered into between hospitals and Medicare SELECT insurers. These safe harbors 
  specifically set forth various standards and guidelines that, if met, will result 
  in the particular arrangement being protected from criminal prosecution or civil 
  sanctions under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. 
<p>DATES: Effective date: This rule is effective on November 5, 1992. Comment 
  period: Although this rule is final, we will consider comments on this regulatory 
  revision delivered to the address provided below by 5 p.m., January 4, 1993. 
  Comments are available for public inspection on November 19, 1992.

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<p>I. Background 
<p>Section 14 of Public Law 100-93 requires the promulgation of regulations specifying 
  those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal prosecution under 
  section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b), 
  and that will not provide a basis for exclusion from<strong></strong> Medicare 
  or the State health care programs under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act. 42 U.S.C. 
  1320a-7(b)(7). State health care programs are the Medicaid program, the Maternal 
  and Child Health Services Block Grant program, and the Social Services Block 
  Grant program. 
<p>Proposed regulations designed to implement section 14 of Public Law 100-93 
  were developed by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and published in the 
  Federal Register on January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3088). The regulations set forth 
  various proposed business and payment practices, or "safe harbors," that would 
  not be treated as criminal offenses under section 1128B(b) of the Act and would 
  not serve as a basis for a program exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of the 
  Act. 
<p>In that proposed rulemaking, we did not specifically delineate a safe harbor 
  provision for a variety of arrangements grouped under the generic headings of 
  "managed care" plans for "preferred provider organizations" (PPOs) because we 
  believed that one or more of the other proposed safe harbors would protect relationships 
  in managed care and PPO networks. However, we did invite public comments on 
  the question of adding additional safe harbors that would provide further protections 
  to health maintenance organizations (HMOs), PPOs and other managed care plans. 
  Although we received a number of responsive comments, we did not publish a specific 
  safe harbor in this area in the final rule published on July 29, 1991 (56 FR 
  35952). As was true then, we could publish the two new safe harbors related 
  to managed care in final form without an opportunity for further public comment. 
  In addition, as discussed in section III.C. of this preamble, we find that good 
  cause exists to publish the amendment regarding Medicare SELECT without a prior 
  comment period. Therefore, further public comment is not required before publication 
  of this rule. However, we will accept public comments submitted within 60 days 
  of the publication of this interim final rule. 
<p>These interim final regulations will be effective upon publication. We find 
  that good cause exists for an immediate effective date due to the nature of 
  these safe harbor regulations. This rule places no affirmative obligation on 
  any individual or entity. Indeed, by expanding safe harbor protection, this 
  rule exempts certain conduct from potential criminal and administrative sanctions. 
  We find that the benefit conferred on the public by this rule's publication 
  provides good cause for it to be effective upon publication. 
<p>We wish to emphasize that nothing in this final regulation changes reimbursement 
  rules promulgated by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) or a State 
  health care program. If a provider chooses to engage in one course of conduct 
  in order to comply with these safe harbor provisions, such action may very well 
  have reimbursement implications. However, such reimbursement is governed exclusively 
  by HCFA or State regulations, and not by this rulemaking. 
<p>II. Summary of Comments Received 
<p>As a result of our request for comments in the proposed rulemaking published 
  on January 23, 1989, we received numerous responses on how best to protect HMOs, 
  PPOs and other managed care plans. The following is a summary of the various 
  issues raised through that public comment process. In the following section, 
  we will discuss our responses to the comments we received. 
<p>Two commenters requested safe harbor protection for HMOs that waive the beneficiary's 
  obligation to pay coinsurance and deductible amounts. They believed that this 
  was a common practice among HMOs. In addition, a few commenters pointed out 
  that some PPOs negotiate agreements with contract health care providers for 
  those providers not to change the health plan or enrollee for some or all of 
  the coinsurance and deductible amounts they are owed for furnishing services 
  to enrollees. Under such an agreement, when the contract provider bills the 
  Medicare program directly (and not the health plan) and agrees to waive all 
  coinsurance and deductibles, the commenters typically phrased the agreement 
  as one "to accept Medicare payment as payment in full." One commenter specifically 
  objected to this practice. 
<p>Several commenters requested the OIG to protect a variety of arrangements between 
  HMOs, PPOs, competitive medical plans (CMPs) as defined in 42 CFR part 417, 
  managed care plans, and other health plans on the one hand, and medical groups 
  and other health care providers who furnish items and services to the health 
  plans at a reduced price on the other hand. A few of these commenters indicated 
  that benefits can be achieved when a health care provider offers discounts to 
  these organizations. 
<p>III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule 
<p>In this section, we discuss our responses to the comments indicated above, 
  and set forth the provisions of this interim final rule. 
<p>Many program beneficiaries are now served by a wide variety of managed care 
  plans, such as various models of HMOs, CMPs, and health care prepayment plans 
  (HCPPs) as defined in 42 CFR part 417, and prepaid health plans (PHPs) as defined 
  in 42 CFR part 434, as well as PPOs, and we agree that additional safe harbor 
  protection is warranted. We are promulgating two safe harbor provisions to protect 
  the essential activities of prepaid health plans ("health plans"). The first 
  provision protects the various marketing incentives that health plans offer 
  to attract "enrollees" through increased benefits coverage, reduced cost- sharing 
  amounts (coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments), or reduced premiums. The 
  second provision protects the contractual relationships between health plans 
  and "contract health care providers" for the furnishing of covered items and 
  services at reduced prices. Before discussing the specific features of these 
  two safe harbor provisions, we will discuss our specific use of the terms "health 
  plan," "contract health care provider," and "enrollee," all of which are defined 
  in &#167; 1001.952(1)(2). 
<p>Definition of Terms 
<p>Health Plan 
<p>For an entity to be classified as a "health plan", it must either (1) furnish, 
  or arrange under agreement with contract health care providers for the furnishing 
  of, items or services to enrollees or, (2) as with some PPOs, furnish health 
  insurance coverage for the provision of such items or services. In either case, 
  it must charge a premium (with exceptions noted below) for these covered benefits. 
  Such premiums may be paid by a variety of sources, including HCFA, a State agency, 
  an employer, or the enrollee. In addition, the health plan must either be operating 
  under a contract or agreement with HCFA or a State health care program, or be 
  subject to State regulation of its premium structure. 
<p>Where the health plans do not operate in accordance with a contract or agreement 
  with HCFA or State health care program, we require the regulation of the premium 
  structures because of our experience with phony insurance plans created by providers 
  where for a $1 "premium" all Medicare coinsurance and deductibles are covered. 
  The premium structure of these "insurance plans" is not based on a bona fide 
  assessment of the liability risk of providing health benefits to enrollees. 
  Therefore, such health plans are not legitimate forms of health insurance or<strong></strong> 
  prepaid health care, and we consider them to be unlawful routine copayment waiver 
  programs. 
<p>Such health plans with regulated premium structures must operate under the 
  oversight to State insurance laws or a State enabling statute governing HMOs 
  or PPOs. Many such health plans may be federally qualified HMOs under 42 U.S.C. 
  300e or may operate under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
  Such health plans also may exist in a variety of other forms. They may be established 
  as provider-based plans, or be independent of providers (such as union-sponsored 
  plans or company plans). In addition, they may be Medicare supplemental (Medigap) 
  policies, such as a Medicare SELECT plan issued under the terms of section 1881(t)(1) 
  of the Act. 
<p>Contract Health Care Provider 
<p>Under these safer harbor provisions, the term "contract health care provider" 
  means an individual or entity under contract with a health plan to furnish to 
  the health plan's enrollees items or services that are covered by the health 
  plan, Medicare, or a State health care program. Although such health care providers 
  may have contractual relationships with health plans to perform a variety of 
  other functions, such as marketing or peer review, the term "contract health 
  care provider" under these two safe harbor provisions is limited to contractual 
  relations for the furnishing of covered items and services. 
<p>Enrollee 
<p>The third defined term for these two safe harbor provisions is "enrollee," 
  meaning an individual who has entered into a contractual relationship with a 
  health plan (or on whose behalf an employer, or other private or governmental 
  entity has entered into such a relationship) under which the individual is entitled 
  to receive specified health care items and services, or insurance coverage for 
  such items and services, in return for payment of a premium. 
<p>Set forth below is a discussion of the specific features of these two safe 
  harbor provisions, and the amendments to existing &#167; 1001.952(k) involving 
  the protection of certain waivers of Medicare copayments for inpatient hospital 
  services under Medicare SELECT. 
<p>A. Increased Coverage, Reduced Cost-sharing Amounts, or Reduced Premium Amounts 
  Offered by Health Plans 
<p>The first of these safe harbor provisions protecting health plans deals with 
  the relationship of health plans to enrollees. Although the anti-kickback statute 
  is generally not implicated when a health plan offers a premium to a Medicare 
  or State health care program beneficiary to provide an insurance package, the 
  statute is implicated when discounts on premiums or other incentives are offered. 
<p>Health plans offer a variety of incentives to attract beneficiaries to enroll. 
  Under these incentives a health plan may increase covered benefits, reduce or 
  eliminate the beneficiary's obligation to pay cost-sharing amounts (such as 
  coinsurance, deductibles, and copayments), or reduce or eliminate the beneficiary's 
  obligation to pay the premium amounts attributable to the costs of furnishing 
  the covered benefits. The first new safer harbor covers health plans operating 
  pursuant to a contract or agreement with HCFA or a State health care program 
  and is divided into two parts. The first part of the safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(l)(1)(i)) 
  protects HMOs, PHPs, CMPs and other health plan under risk contract, and the 
  second part of the safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(l)(1)(i)) protects HMOs, CMPs, 
  PHPs, HCPPs and other health plans paid on a reasonable cost or similar basis. 
  Before discussing the standards contained in these two parts of the safe harbors, 
  we will briefly discuss the types of incentives these health plans offer enrollees 
  and why we believe safe harbor protection is appropriate. 
<p>In some cases, incentives to enrollees are either mandated under the Social 
  Security Act or are provided with the approval of HCFA. For example, under section 
  1876 of the Act and implementing regulations, beneficiaries who enroll in HMOs 
  and CMPs are financially responsible for paying the Medicare coinsurance and 
  deductible amounts. Further, section 1876 permits HMOs and CMPs to charge beneficiaries 
  monthly premiums to cover such coinsurance and deductible amounts. HCFA must 
  approve the premiums that are charged, and it regularly permits health plans 
  to waive these premiums. Further, under certain conditions, section 1876 mandates 
  HMOs and CMPs to offer additional benefits or reduce beneficiary cost-sharing 
  amounts. The decision regarding the mix between additional benefits and reduced 
  cost-sharing amounts, however, is left up to the discretion of the health plan. 
<p>The routine waiver of a beneficiary's obligation to pay coinsurance and deductible 
  amounts by a prepaid health plan is clearly distinguishable from such routine 
  waiver by other health care providers, such as hospital outpatient departments, 
  physicians, or durable medical equipment suppliers. Two principal characteristics 
  distinguish a health plan's routine waiver of cost-sharing amounts from that 
  of other health care providers. First, a health plan's routine waiver program 
  is inextricably intertwined with the offering of a comprehensive package of 
  covered benefits, and is not offered for the purchase of an individual item 
  or service. Quite often, in the case of prepaid plans, the routine waiver of 
  cost-sharing amounts is made in the form of a waiver of the beneficiary's premium 
  and may also be combined with the offering of increased covered benefits. Thus, 
  the routine waiver of cost-sharing amounts is generally not an incentive to 
  use a particular item or service at the time it is furnished. 
<p>Second, although cost-sharing requirements can serve to control utilization, 
  HMOs and other health plans under contract with HCFA or a State health care 
  program have built-in incentives to control unnecessary utilization, or have 
  their utilization and costs monitored by HCFA or the State health care program. 
  Thus, the issue of potential overutilization (with increased costs to the Medicare 
  and Medicaid programs) is adequately dealt with without report to imposing the 
  obligation on beneficiaries to pay coinsurance and deductible amounts. 
<p>As discussed above, both parts of this safe harbor protect health plans that 
  are acting in accordance with a contract or agreement with HCFA or a State health 
  care program. As stated above, the first part of this safe harbor protects incentives 
  offered by risk-based contract health plans, such as HMOs, CMPs and PHPs, operating 
  in accordance with section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, under a Federal statutory 
  demonstration authority, or under other Federal statutory or regulatory authority. 
  The only standard for such health plans is that the health plan may not discriminate 
  in the offering of these incentives, but must offer the same incentives to all 
  enrollees unless otherwise specifically approved by HCFA or a State health care 
  program. This standard will minimize the possibility for the health plan to 
  improperly favor certain healthy beneficiaries or to use incentives to improperly 
  encourage utilization at the time the item or service is furnished. 
<p>The second part of the safe harbor protects incentives offered to enrollees 
  by HMOs, CMPs, PHPs and HCPPs that are under contract with HCFA or a State health 
  care program, and that are paid on a reasonable cost or similar basis. For these 
  plans, two standards must be<strong></strong> met. One, the same incentives 
  must be offered to all enrollees for all covered services. And two, the health 
  plan may not claim the cost of these incentives as bad debts or otherwise shift 
  the burden of these incentives onto Medicare, Medicaid, other payors, or individuals. 
  We impose this second standard because the incentives a health plan offers to 
  its enrollees should make economic sense for the health plan, and should not 
  be motivated by a desire to shift costs. In addition, it is noted that claiming 
  such costs as Medicare bad debts is not authorized under 42 CFR 413.80 and 417.536 
  of the Medicare regulations. And where such a claim is presented unlawfully, 
  an entity may be subject to civil or criminal prosecution. 
<p>This new safe harbor does not protect incentives to enrollees offered by health 
  plans that do not have a contractual relationship with HCFA or a State health 
  care program. (Note: As indicated above, we are amending existing &#167; 1001.952(k) 
  to protect certain waivers of Medicare copayments for inpatient hospital services 
  under Medicare SELECT. See section III.C. of this preamble below.) An example 
  of some of the incentives we are not protecting is an agreement between a PPO 
  and a contract health care provider whereby that provider agrees not to charge 
  the health plan or enrollee all or part of the coinsurance and deductible amounts. 
  When the contract provider bills the program directly (and not the health plan) 
  and agrees to waive all coinsurance and deductibles, the agreement typically 
  is characterized as an agreement to "accept Medicare payment as payment in full." 
  Although such waiver programs may be offered in conjunction with a package of 
  health care benefits and thus have some features similar to the other waiver 
  programs we are protecting in this safe harbor provision, we are not convinced 
  that the Medicare and Medicaid programs are properly protected against overutilization. 
  As discussed above, when a health plan under contract with HCFA or a State health 
  care program waives cost-sharing amounts, utilization and costs are controlled 
  or monitored. This is not necessarily the case with HMOs and PPOs or their providers 
  that bill the Medicare and Medicaid programs on a fee-for-service basis. 
<p>For this reason, we are soliciting comments on whether safe harbor protection 
  should be afforded health plans, which do not have a contract or agreement with 
  HCFA or a State health care program, to waive cost-sharing amounts as part of 
  their agreements with contract providers. <br>
  <br>
<p>B. Price Reductions Offered to Health Plans 
<p>This second safe harbor provision for health plans protects the price reductions 
  offered to them by contract health care providers pursuant to an agreement to 
  furnish or arrange for the furnishing of covered items and services. Typically, 
  health care providers will contract with health plans and agree to furnish items 
  and services to enrollees of the health plan at a discount from the provider's 
  usual fee in return for obtaining a large volume of patients. 
<p>As with the safe harbor provision discussed above protecting incentives to 
  enrollees, this safe harbor provision is divided into two separate parts for 
  risk-based and cost-reimbursed health plans that operate in accordance with 
  a contract or agreement with HCFA or a State health care program. In addition, 
  this price reduction safe harbor provision contains a third part protecting 
  other health plans that do not have contracts or agreements with HCFA or State 
  health care programs where additional standards are met. 
<p>Before discussing the standards to be met in each of these three price reduction 
  safe harbors, we will discuss three definitional prerequisites in &#167; 1001.952(m)(1). 
  The first prerequisite is that the protected remuneration is the contract health 
  care provider's reduction of its usual charges for the services. This safe harbor 
  does not cover reductions which are applicable only to a specific part or portion 
  of the health care provider's charge, such as coinsurance and deductibles, but 
  only applies to reductions in the total amount charged by the health care provider 
  as its usual fee. Furthermore, we are only protecting the remuneration which 
  represents the price reduction offered by the contract health care provider 
  to make clear that any other forms of remuneration offered or paid by a contract 
  health care provider to a health plan are not protected under this safe harbor 
  provision. Indeed, we will closely review any forms of other such remuneration 
  to ensure that improper payments are not employed to induce the health plan 
  to issue a contract or otherwise steer patients to the person paying the remuneration. 
<p>The second prerequisite is that the terms of the agreement between the parties 
  must be in writing. This prerequisite is intended to assist the Department in 
  understanding the intent of the parties. Obviously, if need be, we will look 
  behind the contract to determine if the real intent of the parties is not fully 
  disclosed in the written agreement. 
<p>The third prerequisite is that the agreement must be for the sole purpose of 
  having the contract health care provider furnish to enrollees items or services 
  that are covered by the health plan, Medicare, or Medicaid. In other words, 
  this provision does not protect contracts between health plans and contract 
  health care providers for these providers to furnish services other than covered 
  benefits. For example, many contract health care providers furnish peer review, 
  marketing services, or pre-enrollment screening. We note that health plans with 
  HCFA contracts under section 1876 of the Act are not permitted to engage in 
  such pre-enrollment screening as a means of denying or discouraging relatively 
  sick beneficiaries from enrolling (sections 1876(c)(3) and (i)(6) of the Act). 
  For the remuneration attributable to the furnishing of other than covered services 
  to be protected, it must comply with the personal service/management contracts 
  safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(d)) as set forth in the safe harbor regulations 
  published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35952). And as with 
  all safe harbor provisions, where two parties engage in a multi-faceted payment 
  arrangement where protection is sought from more than one safe harbor, separate 
  justifications must be clearly set forth for each provision for which protection 
  is sought. 
<p>We are imposing this third prerequisite because of our experience with some 
  HMOs that have abused their contractual relationships with medical groups where 
  individuals in the groups have engaged in abusive or illegal activities on behalf 
  of the HMO, for example, by conducting pre-enrollment screening. In at least 
  one case such activities have resulted in a criminal conviction. We intend to 
  use our authorities aggressively to monitor closely and penalize where appropriate 
  any abusive relationships between health plans and contract health care providers 
  to assure the medically necessary services of a high quality are available and 
  accessible to all enrollees. <br>
  <br>
<p>We now discuss the standards in each of the three parts of the price reduction 
  safe harbor. The first part of this safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(m)(1)(i)) protects 
  risk-based HMOs, PHPs and CMPs under contract with HCFA or a State health care 
  program, and operating in accordance with section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the 
  Act, under a Federal statutory demonstration authority, or under other Federal 
  statutory or regulatory authority. Risk-based<strong></strong> contract health 
  plans must meet the three fundamental prerequisites discussed above. Additionally, 
  except as specifically authorized by HCFA or the State health care program, 
  contract health care providers may not separately bill Medicare, Medicaid or 
  another State health care program for items or services furnished under the 
  agreement with the health plan. Nor may the contract health care provider otherwise 
  shift the burden of the agreement onto Medicare, Medicaid, other payors, or 
  individuals. 
<p>The second part of the price reduction safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(m)(1)(ii)) 
  protects health plans that have executed a contract or agreement with HCFA or 
  a State health care program to have payment made on a reasonable cost or similar 
  basis. Price reduction agreements with contract health care providers will be 
  protected as long as four standards are met. One, the term of the agreement 
  may not be for less than one year. Two, the agreement must specify in advance 
  the covered items and services that the contract health care provider will furnish 
  to enrollees and the methodology for computing the payment to the contract health 
  care provider. Three, the health plan must fully and accurately report to HCFA 
  or the State health care program the amount it has paid the contract health 
  care provider pursuant to the agreement. And four, the contract health care 
  provider may not claim payment in any form unless specifically authorized by 
  HCFA or the State health care program, or otherwise shift the burden of such 
  an agreement onto Medicare, Medicaid, other payors, or individuals for the costs 
  of furnishing the items and services. Any claim for reimbursement made directly 
  to Medicare, Medicaid or other State health care program for items or services 
  for which payment was made by the health plan would constitute an unlawful false 
  claim. 
<p>The third part of the price reduction safe harbor (&#167; 1001.952(m)(1)(iii)) 
  protects price reductions offered by contract health care providers to all other 
  health plans where six standards are met. One, the term of the price reduction 
  agreement may not be for less than one year. Two, the agreement must specify 
  in advance the covered items and services, which party is to file claims or 
  requests for payment with Medicare, Medicaid and the other State health care 
  programs, and the schedule of fees that contract provider will be paid. In other 
  words, to meet this second standard, although it does not matter whether the 
  health plan or the contract health care provider bills Medicare, Medicaid or 
  another State health care program, the parties must agree to a set fee schedule. 
  Three, unless a fee update is specifically authorized by Medicare or a State 
  health care program, the fee schedule must remain in effect throughout the term 
  of the agreement. Four, the party submitting claims for items or services furnished 
  under the agreement may not claim or request payment for amounts in excess of 
  the fee schedule. This fourth standard should not be misconstrued as a "lowest 
  charge" provision in that it does not restrict the contract provider from claiming 
  or requesting payment in amounts in excess of this fee schedule when it negotiates 
  a different fee schedule with another health plan or when it is furnishing items 
  or services directly to enrollees on a fee-for-service basis. Five, full and 
  accurate reporting of costs must be made by the health plan or the contract 
  health care provider. And six, to help assure that false claims are not filed, 
  we prohibit the party which is not responsible under the agreement for seeking 
  reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and any other State health care program 
  from claiming payment or otherwise shifting the burden of the price reduction 
  onto Medicare, Medicaid, other payors, or individuals. 
<p>C. Waiver of Part A Deductible and Coinsurance Amounts Pursuant to an Agreement 
  Between a Hospital and a Medicare SELECT Insurer 
<p>The Department has designated 15 States in which State insurance regulators 
  may approve the issuance of Medicare supplemental (Medigap) insurance policies 
  that restrict Medigap benefits to services provided through a network of providers 
  if the standards in section 1882(t)(1) of the Act are met. (See Pub. L. 101-508, 
  section 4358.) Under this authority, known as Medicare SELECT, approved insurers 
  may contract with health care provider entities to furnish items or services 
  to policyholders. Subject to the approval of the State insurance commissioner, 
  the Medicare SELECT insurer may pay less than full Medigap benefits for services 
  obtained outside this provider network. 
<p>In return for becoming a preferred provider under the Medicare SELECT plan, 
  the provider would presumably be willing to accept less payment for its treatment 
  of Medicare SELECT beneficiaries. The Medicare SELECT insurer, in turn, should 
  be able to provide health care to its beneficiaries at a lower price. The beneficiary 
  will, in theory, relinquish some freedom of choice in selecting health care 
  providers in return for lower Medigap insurance premiums. 
<p>The arrangements between Medicare SELECT insurers and provider entities might 
  implicate the anti-kickback statute. The provider may offer or pay remuneration 
  (in the form of reducing its charges) to induce the referral of Medicare patients 
  by the insurer to the provider. Likewise, the insurer may solicit or receive 
  remuneration from the provider in return for the insurer's referral of Medicare 
  beneficiaries. We believe that some potential arrangements between Medicare 
  SELECT insurers and providers should be granted safe harbor protection while 
  other potential arrangements could be abusive and do not deserve protection. 
<p>We have identified two types of arrangements between Medicare SELECT insurers 
  and providers that may implicate the statute but deserve safe harbor protection. 
  First, payments between Medicare SELECT insurers and health care providers may 
  be protected under the newly established safe harbor for price reductions offered 
  to health plans (&#167; 1001.952(m)). Second, waivers or reduction of inpatient 
  hospital coinsurance and deductible by a hospital pursuant to an agreement with 
  a Medicare SELECT insurer will be protected under the amendment to the safe 
  harbor set forth below. 
<p>On July 29, 1991, the Department published final regulations which, among other 
  provisions, included a safe harbor for the reduction or waiver of coinsurance 
  or deductible amounts for inpatient hospital services paid for under the prospective 
  payment system (&#167; 1001.952(k)(1)). To receive safe harbor protection, three 
  standards must be met: (1) The hospital may not claim the waived amount as bad 
  debt or otherwise shift the cost of the waiver; (2) the hospital may not discriminate 
  in offering reductions or waivers based on the patient's reason for admission; 
  and (3) the reduction or waiver may not result from an agreement between the 
  hospital and a third-party payor. The Department concluded that waivers of coinsurance 
  and deductibles for inpatient hospital services that comply with these standards 
  will not increase costs to the Medicare program, shift costs to other payors, 
  or increase patient demand for inpatient hospital services. 
<p>We are amending this existing safe harbor to accommodate the waiver or reduction 
  of inpatient hospital coinsurance or deductible amounts made pursuant to a contract 
  between the hospital and a Medicare SELECT insurer. Specifically, the third 
  standard in this safe harbor will now exempt<strong> </strong>agreements that 
  are part of a contract between a hospital and a Medicare SELECT insurer for 
  the furnishing of items or services to Medicare SELECT beneficiaries. To qualify 
  for protection under this safe harbor, the insurer must have issued a Medicare 
  SELECT insurance policy under the terms of section 1882(t)(1) of the Act. In 
  other words, the Medicare SELECT policy must meet all of the requirements of 
  section 1882(t)(1), and must be approved by a State insurance commissioner for 
  use in one of the 15 States designated by the Secretary. Furthermore, to be 
  protected by this safe harbor, the waiver of coinsurance or deductible amounts 
  provided for under the agreement must be limited to beneficiaries covered by 
  the insurer's Medicare SELECT policy. 
<p>The other requirements of the safe harbor still apply to such waivers or reductions. 
  We believe that this amendment will allow Medicare SELECT insurers to enter 
  into advantageous contracts with hospitals, while continuing to ensure that 
  hospital waivers do not increase costs to Medicare or other payors, or promote 
  over utilization. The evaluation of Medicare SELECT to be completed in 1994 
  (see Pub. L. 101-508, section 4358(d)) will enable us to determine whether this 
  amendment has had any of these undesirable effects. 
<p>In contrast, we will provide safe harbor protection for other types of arrangements 
  between Medicare SELECT insurers and providers that may implicate the anti-kickback 
  statute. For example, we continue to consider routine waivers of coinsurance 
  and deductibles under Part B of Medicare to be an area of potential abuse. Any 
  provider that routinely waives coinsurance and deductible under Part B is subject 
  to criminal liability and civil and administrative sanctions under Federal false 
  claims and false statements statutes as well as the anti-kickback statute. (See 
  OIG's Special Fraud Alert on Routine Waiver of Copayments or Deductibles Under 
  Medicare Part B.) Section 1882(t) of the Act does not provide any safeguards 
  against the abuse of Part B waivers. Therefore, we will not grant any safe harbor 
  protection for the waiver or reduction of Part B coinsurance or deductibles 
  by Medicare SELECT providers. 
<p>We find good cause to publish this amendment in interim final form with a comment 
  period rather than as a proposed rule. We find that the delay that would result 
  from soliciting public comment prior to publications would be impracticable, 
  unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Medicare SELECT only applies 
  to Medicare supplemental (Medigap) insurers who meet specific statutory criteria 
  in one of 15 States designated by the Secretary during the three year period 
  commencing on January 1, 1992. Because the Medicare SELECT program has already 
  started and is only authorized to continue to the end of 1994, the amendment 
  must be published promptly in final form in order to have its intended effect, 
  that is, to protect certain transactions involving Medicare SELECT providers. 
  Furthermore, the amendment is quite limited in scope since it merely broadens 
  one standard in an existing safe harbor to accommodate certain actions taken 
  in accordance with agreements between hospitals and Medicare SELECT insurers. 
  Finally, the amendment by expanding a safe harbor, places no affirmative obligations 
  on any individuals or entities. Rather, the amendment expands a safe harbor 
  to enable some entities to more easily immunize themselves from potential criminal 
  and administrative sanctions. 
<p>IV. Additional Information 
<p>A. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<p>Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a final regulatory 
  impact analysis for any regulation that meets one of the Executive Order criteria 
  for a "major rule," that is, that which would be likely to result in (1) an 
  annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in 
  costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, State, or local 
  government agencies or geographic regions; or, (3) significant adverse effects 
  on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the 
  ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises 
  in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory 
  flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
  (5 U.S.C. 601-612), unless the Secretary certifies that a final regulation would 
  not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<p>In the proposed rule published on January 23, 1989, we indicated that this 
  provision was designed to specify business and payment practices that would 
  not be considered a kickback for purposes of criminal or civil remedies, and 
  served to clarify departmental policy as to the legality of various commercial 
  arrangements. We stated that the great majority of health care providers and 
  practitioners do not engage in illegal remuneration schemes, and that the aggregate 
  economic impact of this provision should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only 
  those who have chosen to engage in prohibited payment schemes in violation of 
  the statutory intent. As indicated above, this interim final rulemaking serves 
  to further expand the safe harbor provisions to enable entities to more easily 
  immunize themselves from potential criminal and administrative sanctions, and 
  to eliminate potential barriers to the provision of coordinated health care 
  under the Medicare and State health care programs. 
<p>Consistent with the intent of the statute, this regulation has been designed 
  to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business practices and 
  arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and economy. Compliance 
  with these provisions may require that certain individuals and entities change 
  their business practices or arrangements. It is impossible to predict how many 
  individuals and entities will be affected by this regulation. We believe, however, 
  that the number will be insignificant. 
<p>For this reason, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysis is not 
  required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this 
  final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a number of small 
  business entities, and we have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility 
  analysis. 
<p>B. Information Collection Requirements 
<p>Sections 1001.952(m)(1)(ii) and 1001.952(m)(1)(iii) of this rule contain information 
  collection requirements which are subject to Office of Management and Budget 
  review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. These sections are currently 
  approved under OMB control number 0938-0165 (HCFA-276). Comments on these requirements 
  may be forwarded to the individual whose name appears in the address section 
  of this preamble. 
<p>C. Department of Justice Review 
<p>In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 100-93, these regulations have 
  been developed in consultation with the Department of Justice. 
<p>D. Response to Comments 
<p>Because of the large number of comments we normally receive on regulations, 
  we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider 
  all comments received timely and the appropriateness of revising this interim 
  final rule.

  amounts attributable to items or services covered by the health plan, the Medicare 
  program, or a State health care program, as long as the health plan complies 
  with all of the standards within one of the following two categories of health 
  plans: 
<p>(i) If the health plan is a risk-based health maintenance organization, competitive 
  medical plan, prepaid health plan, or other health plan under contact with HCFA 
  or a State health care program and operating in accordance with section 1876(g) 
  or 1903(m) of the Act, under a Federal statutory demonstration authority, or 
  under other Federal statutory or regulatory authority, it must offer the same 
  increased coverage or reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts to all enrollees 
  unless otherwise approved by HCFA or by a State health care program. 
<p>(ii) If the health plan is a health maintenance organization, competitive medical 
  plan, health care prepayment plan, prepaid health plan or other health plan 
  that has executed a contract or agreement with HCFA or with a State health care 
  program to receive payment for enrollees on a reasonable cost or<strong> </strong>similar 
  basis, it must comply with both of the following two standards-- 
<p>(A) The health plan must offer the same increased coverage or reduced cost- 
  sharing or premium amounts to all enrollees unless otherwise approved by HCFA 
  or by a State health care program; and 
<p>(B) The health plan must not claim the costs of the increased coverage or the 
  reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts as a bad debt for payment purposes under 
  Medicare or a State health care program or otherwise shift the burden of the 
  increased coverage or reduced cost-sharing or premium amounts onto Medicare, 
  a State health care program, other payors, or individuals. 
<p>(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this section, the terms-- 
<p>Contract health care provider means an individual or entity under contract 
  with a health plan to furnish items or services to enrollees who are covered 
  by the health plan, Medicare, or a State health care program. 
<p>Enrollee means an individual who has entered into a contractual relationship 
  with a health plan (or on whose behalf an employer, or other private or governmental 
  entity has entered into such a relationship) under which the individual is entitled

  such items and services, in return for payment of a premium. 
<p>Health plan means an entity that furnishes or arranges under agreement with 
  contract health care providers for the furnishing of items or services to enrollees, 
  or furnishes insurance coverage for the provision of such items and services, 
  in exchange for a premium, where such entity either operates in accordance with 
  a contract, agreement or statutory demonstration authority approved by HCFA 
  or a State health care program, or has its premium structure regulated under 
  a State insurance statute or a State enabling statute governing health maintenance 
  organizations or preferred provider organizations. 
<p>(m) Price reductions offered to health plans. (1) As used in section 1128B 
  of the Act, "remuneration" does not include a reduction in price a contract 
  health care provider offers to a health plan in accordance with the terms of 
  a written agreement between the contract health care provider and the health 
  plan for the sole purpose of furnishing to enrollees items or services that 
  are covered by the health plan, Medicare, or a State health care program, as 
  long as both the health plan and contract health care provider comply with all 
  of the applicable standards within one of the following three categories of 
  health plans: 
<p>(i) If the health plan is a health maintenance organization, competitive medical 
  plan, or prepaid health plan under contract with HCFA or a State agency and 
  operating in accordance with section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, under a 
  Federal statutory demonstration authority, or under other Federal statutory 
  or regulatory authority, the contract health care provider must not claim payment 
  in any form from the Department or the State agency for items or services furnished 
  in accordance with the agreement except as approved by HCFA or the State health 
  care program, or otherwise shift the burden of such an agreement onto Medicare, 
  a State health care program, other payors, or individuals. 
<p>(ii) If the health plan is a health maintenance organization, competitive medical 
  plan, health care prepayment plan, prepaid health plan, or other health plan 
  that has executed a contract or agreement with HCFA or a State health care program 
  to receive payment for enrollees on a reasonable cost or<strong></strong> similar 
  basis, the health plan and contract health care provider must comply with all 
  of the following four standards-- 
<p>(A) The term of the agreement between the health plan and the contract health 
  care provider must be for not less than one year; 
<p>(B) The agreement between the health plan and the contract health care provider 
  must specify in advance the covered items and services to be furnished to enrollees, 
  and the methodology for computing the payment to the contract health care provider; 
<p>(C) The health plan must fully and accurately report, on the applicable cost 
  report or other claim form filed with the Department or the State health care 
  program, the amount it has paid the contract health care provider under the 
  agreement for the covered items and services furnished to enrollees; and 
<p>(D) The contract health care provider must not claim payment in any form from 
  the Department or the State health care program for items or services furnished

  of this section, both the health plan and contract health care provider must 
  comply with all of the following six standards-- 
<p>(A) The term of the agreement between the health plan and the contract health 
  care provider must be for not less than one year; 
<p>(B) The agreement between the health plan and the contract health care provider 
  must specify in advance the covered items and services to be furnished to enrollees, 
  which party is to file claims or requests for payment with Medicare or the State 
  health care program for such items and services, and the schedule of fees the 
  contract health care provider will charge for furnishing such items and services 
  to enrollees; 
<p>(C) The fee schedule contained in the agreement between the health plan and 
  the contract health care provider must remain in effect throughout the term 
  of the agreement, unless a fee increase results directly from a payment update 
  authorized by Medicare or the State health care program; <br>
  <br>
<p>(D) The party submitting claims or requests for payment from Medicare or the 
  State health care program for items and services furnished in accordance with 
  the agreement must not claim or request payment for amounts in excess of the
