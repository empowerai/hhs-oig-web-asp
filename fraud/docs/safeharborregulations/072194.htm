<p>Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; 
<p>Clarification of the OIG Safe Harbor Anti-Kickback Provisions <br>
  <br>
<p>AGENCY: Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS. 
<p>ACTION: Proposed rule. 
<p>SUMMARY: This proposed rule would clarify various aspects of safe 
<p>harbor provisions originally published in the Federal Register on July 
<p>29, 1991 as a final rule (56 FR 35952). The safe harbor provisions have 
<p>been specifically designed to set forth those payment practices and 
<p>business arrangements that will be protected from criminal prosecution 
<p>and civil sanctions under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. 
<p>This proposed rule would modify the original set of final safe harbor 
<p>provisions to give greater clarity to the rulemaking's original intent. 
<p>DATES: To assure consideration, public comments must be delivered to 
<p>the address provided below by September 19, 1994. Comments are 
<p>available for public inspection August 4, 1994. 
<p>ADDRESSES: Address comments to: Office of Inspector General, Department 
<p>of Health and Human Services, Attention: LRR-35-P, room 5246, 330 
<p>Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20201. 
<p>If you prefer, you may deliver your comments to room 5551, 330

  <br>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<p>I. Background <br>
  <br>
<p>On July 29, 1991, we published in the Federal Register a final rule 
<p>setting forth various safe harbor provisions to the Medicare and 
<p>Medicaid anti-kickback statute (56 FR 35952). This regulation was 
<p>authorized under section 14 of Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and 
<p>Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987. The final rule 
<p>specified those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal 
<p>prosecution under section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) 
<p>(42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)), and that will not provide a basis for 
<p>exclusion from Medicare or the State health care programs under section 
<p>1128(b)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7)). 
<p>Since publication of the final rule, we have become aware of a 
<p>limited number of ambiguities that have created uncertainties for 
<p>health care providers trying to comply with the safe harbor provisions. 
<p>We have also become aware of certain instances where our intent, either 
<p>to protect or preclude protection for particular business arrangements, 
<p>is not fully reflected in the text of the regulation even though it is 
<p>reflected in the preamble. This proposed rule would serve to modify the 
<p>text of the July 29, 1991 final rule to conform to the rulemaking's 
<p>original intent. 
<p>The clarifications contained in this proposed rule do not represent 
<p>an attempt to reevaluate the wisdom of the original safe-harbor 
<p>decisions. Instead, the changes set forth in this proposed rule would 
<p>serve only to protect business practices originally intended to be 
<p>protected by removing ambiguities in the regulatory language. This 
<p>clarity should aid the formation of legal business practices without 
<p>establishing any new significant legal obligations on the parties 
<p>affected by the regulations. 
<p>II. Summary of the Proposed Changes 
<p>A. Clarification to the General Comments Section of Preamble 
<p> -- Several individuals have commented that the following 
<p>sentence in the preamble has created confusion: 
<p>``Because the statute is broad, the payment practices described in 
<p>these safe harbor provisions would be prohibited by the statute but for 
<p>their inclusion here.'' (56 FR 35958) <br>
  <br>
<p>This sentence was not meant to imply that, in all instances 
<p>irrespective of the parties intent, the government could prosecute 
<p>conduct described in the regulation, but for its inclusion in the 
<p>regulation. Whether a particular payment practice violates the statute 
<p>is a question that can only be resolved by an analysis of the elements 
<p>of the statute as applied to that set of facts. Generally speaking, 
<p>however, the original final rule did describe payment practices that 
<p>would be prohibited, where the unlawful intent exists, but for the safe 
<p>harbor protection that has been granted. 
<p>-- In discussing the space and equipment rental and personal 
<p>services and management contracts, we stated that if a ``sham contract 
<p>is entered into * * * we will look behind the contract'' to its 
<p>substance in evaluating whether the arrangement qualifies for safe- 
<p>harbor protection (56 FR 35972). We received numerous inquiries as to 
<p>whether we would similarly look behind the form of other arrangements 
<p>to determine whether the substance of the arrangement fits within a 
<p>particular safe harbor. 
<p>In some cases, such inquiries have led us to clarify particular 
<p>safe harbors, as is illustrated by the following discussions of the 
<p>safe harbors for investment interests, space and equipment rental, and 
<p>personal services and management contracts. However, because of the 
<p>broad variety of transactions subject to the Medicare and Medicaid 
<p>anti-kickback statute and the ability of individuals to manipulate the 
<p>safe harbors in ways not contemplated, we believe that a general rule 
<p>preventing sham arrangements from receiving safe harbor protection 
<p>would be appropriate. Thus, we are proposing adding a new Sec. 1001.954 
<p>to the regulations. Such an approach has several precedents. The 
<p>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with the concurrence of the Department 
<p>of Justice promulgated Sec. 801.90 of the FTC's rules implementing the 
<p>Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (16 CFR 801.90), 
<p>which disregards sham transactions entered into for the purpose of 
<p>avoiding obligations under the Act. In addition, other Federal agencies 
<p>(such as the Securities Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue 
<p>Service) have promulgated regulations and policies that seek to protect 
<p>the government from making enforcement decisions based on information 
<p>that does not accurately reflect the substance of the transaction. 
<p>(See, for example, 17 CFR 240.12b-20; Estate of Korman versus Comm., TC 
<p>Memo 1987-120; and Rev. Rul. 81-149, 1981-1 CB 77.) Moreover, the 
<p>courts have historically disregarded sham arrangements when examining 
<p>the rights and obligations of the parties in tax cases. (See, for 
<p>example, Knetsch versus United States, 364 U.S. 361 (1960); and 
<p>Thompson versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 631 F.2d 642 (9th 
<p>Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 961 (1981).) 
<p>B. Clarifications to Investment Interests Safe Harbor 
<p>(Sec. 1001.952(a)) 
<p>-- Health Care Assets and Revenues 
<p>In qualifying for the ``large entity'' or ``small entity'' 
<p>investment interest safe harbors, the monetary value or amount of 
<p>certain assets and revenues must be determined. Specifically, the safe 
<p>harbors include: (1) The $50,000,000 asset threshold in 
<p>Sec. 1001.952(a)(1); and (2) the gross revenues in the ``60-40 revenue 
<p>rule'' in Sec. 1001.952(a)(2)(vi). In these cases, only the assets or 
<p>revenues related to the furnishing of health care items or services 
<p>will be counted for the purposes of qualifying for these safe harbor 
<p>requirements. It would be an obvious sham, inconsistent with our 
<p>original intent, if a joint venture could merge with a non-health care 
<p>business and have those non-health care assets, and the revenues 
<p>derived from that non-health care line of business counted for the 
<p>purposes of qualifying for safe harbor protection. We are thus 
<p>proposing to revise these safe harbor provisions to further clarify our 
<p>original intent that only health care assets and revenues will be 
<p>counted in determining these values and amounts. 
<p>-- Acquisition of Investment Interests 
<p>As set forth in Sec. 1001.952(a)(1)(ii), an ``interested'' investor 
<p>(who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items 
<p>or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity) must 
<p>obtain his or her investment interest through trading on a registered 
<p>national securities exchange on terms equally available to the public. 
<p>This does not mean that an interested investor may acquire his or her 
<p>interest in any way other than the methods available to the general 
<p>public to acquire investment interests. We believe that the investor 
<p>must acquire his or her investment interest in the same way as members 
<p>of the public--directly off of a registered national securities 
<p>exchange through a broker--and it must be the same type of investment 
<p>interest that is available to the public. For example, a transaction in 
<p>which the interested investor receives restricted or ``lettered'' stock 
<p>from the entity would not be considered a valid acquisition of 
<p>investment interests under this requirement. 
<p>The discussion above does not represent a change in this standard. 
<p>Rather, it serves only to emphasize that the investment interest ``must 
<p>be obtained on terms equally available to the public through trading on 
<p>a registered national securities exchange * * *'' 
<p>(Sec. 1001.952(a)(1)(ii)) (Emphasis added). Moreover, to obtain an 
<p>investment interest ``on terms equally available to the public,'' there 
<p>cannot be any side agreements that require stock to be purchased or 
<p>that restrict in any manner the investor's ability to dispose of the 
<p>stock. Any such agreement would constitute a sham transaction which 
<p>would disqualify dividend payments to that investor from safe harbor 
<p>protection. 
<p>-- Loans for the Purchase of the Investment Interest 
<p>One of the standards in the large and small entity investment 
<p>interest safe harbors prohibits the entity from loaning an investor 
<p>funds that are used by the investor to purchase his or her investment 
<p>interest. (See Secs. 1001.952(a)(1)(iv) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vii).) We 
<p>are proposing to change this standard to prohibit other investors, 
<p>individuals or entities as well as the entity from making such loans. 
<p>-- Class of Investment Interests 
<p>In the 60-40 investor rule in the small entity investment interest 
<p>safe harbor (Sec. 1001.952(a)(2)(i)), we established two categories of 
<p>investors: (1) ``untainted'' or ``disinterested'' investors are those 
<p>who do no business with the entity, but hold the investment interest 
<p>purely as an investment; and (2) ``tainted'' or ``interested'' 
<p>investors are those who are in a position to make or influence 
<p>referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate 
<p>business for the entity. For purposes of determining in which category 
<p>to place an investor, we require ``each class of investments'' to meet 
<p>the 60-40 apportionment between the two categories. 
<p>We have become aware of the difficulty in applying the 60-40 rule 
<p>to each class of investors in a joint venture where the general 
<p>partners hold a separate class of stock or investment interest from the 
<p>limited partners. In such a situation, that class of investment 
<p>interest for the general partners consists of 100 percent ``tainted'' 
<p>or ``interested'' investors since the general partners are providing 
<p>services to the entity. Therefore, we believe that the entire joint 
<p>venture does not qualify for safe harbor protection. 
<p>While it is not always true that an active investor holds a 
<p>different class of investment interest from a passive investor, we have 
<p>found that it is unnecessarily restrictive to have this 60-40 investor 
<p>rule only apply to each class of investment interest. Thus, we are 
<p>proposing to modify this first investment interest standard to allow an 
<p>alternative to the class-by-class analysis. The new alternative would 
<p>allow equity investment interests to be combined together or debt 
<p>investment interests to be combined together (separate from the equity 
<p>investments) for purposes of apportioning investors into ``untainted'' 
<p>and ``tainted'' pools and meeting the 60-40 test. Only equivalent 
<p>classes of equity investment interests could be combined, and only 
<p>equivalent classes of debt investment interests could be combined. That 
<p>is, the classes of investment interests combined would have to be 
<p>similar in all material respects. For example, the classes to be 
<p>combined would have to have equivalent returns in proportion to amounts 
<p>invested. In addition, if one class is given preferential treatment 
<p>(e.g., in the case of disposition), such an interest could not be 
<p>combined with subservient interests for purposes of compliance with the 
<p>60-40 investor rule. 
<p>If a limited partnership has a general partner who holds 20 percent 
<p>of the value of the investment interests, referring physicians hold 20 
<p>percent, and all the other investors have no business relationship with 
<p>the partnerships, then the 60-40 investor rule would be met, as long as 
<p>all other requirements are satisfied. 
<p>The 60-40 investor rule would not be met if any of the other 
<p>disinterested investors in the above example holds a debt instrument 
<p>instead of an equity instrument. For example, if a joint venture raises 
<p>one-third of its capital through a debt instrument held by 
<p>disinterested investors, with the remaining two thirds of its capital 
<p>derived from equity instruments held equally by interested (physicians 
<p>and general partners) and disinterested investors, the safe harbor 
<p>would not be met. In this example, even though interested investors 
<p>hold only one-third of all the investment interests, they hold one-half 
<p>of the equity investment interests, and thus no safe harbor protection 
<p>would be available. 
<p>We note that other standards in this small entity safe harbor 
<p>preclude protection for abusive schemes to give referring investors 
<p>preferential treatment in any way by creating different classes of 
<p>investment. For example, if a joint venture creates two classes of 
<p>stock, with one of the classes reserved for referring physicians who 
<p>receive a higher dividend per share than non-referring investors in the 
<p>other class, such an arrangement would not comply with at least 
<p>sections 1001.952(a)(2) (ii), (iii) and (viii). 
<p>-- Items or Services Furnished by an Investor 
<p>As discussed above, when an investor furnishes items or services to 
<p>the joint venture, such as management services, he or she is a tainted 
<p>or interested investor for the purposes of complying with the 60-40 
<p>investor rule (Sec. 1001.952(a)(2)(vi)). It was not our intent to have 
<p>any revenues that the joint venture derives from this investor's 
<p>services to be considered tainted for the purpose of qualifying for the 
<p>60-40 revenue rule. 
<p>Because of the apparent confusion caused by the language ``items or 
<p>services furnished'' in this safe harbor standard, we are proposing 
<p>striking it. The focus of the inquiry in this standard is where the 
<p>business and clients are coming from. In other words, the revenues are 
<p>tainted, and may not exceed 40 percent of total revenues, if they are 
<p>derived ``from referrals* * * or business otherwise generated from 
<p>investors.'' We note that the language we are proposing to strike-- 
<p>``items or services furnished''--is superfluous because, if the revenue 
<p>is ``generated'' (i.e., induced to come to the joint venture for items 
<p>or services by an investor), it is tainted. Thus, the language we are 
<p>proposing to delete appears not to have added anything and merely 
<p>caused confusion. 
<p>The following example demonstrates the confusion and our solution. 
<p>If a radiologist holds an investment interest in an imaging center and 
<p>reads all the films at the center, his or her reading of the film does 
<p>not taint all the revenues from the referrals by non-investors. 
<p>However, we have received a few questions from people who read the 60- 
<p>40 revenue rule as making such referrals tainted because the investor 
<p>furnished services at the joint venture. 
<p>We emphasize that if a radiologist-investor is reading the film and 
<p>making referrals or otherwise generating business, then the revenues 
<p>the joint venture derives from that activity would become tainted. For 
<p>example, revenues would be tainted when a radiologist-investor takes 
<p>part in a consultation with a non-investor internist, and during that 
<p>consultation the radiologist recommends a procedure which is performed 
<p>at the joint venture. 
<p>C. Clarifications to Space and Equipment Rental and Personal Services 
<p>and Management Contracts Safe Harbors (Secs. 1001.952 (b), (c) and (d)) 
<p>-- In the preamble discussing the safe harbor provisions for 
<p>space and equipment rental and personal services and management 
<p>contracts (56 FR 35971-74), we made clear that one of our concerns was 
<p>that health care providers in a position to make referrals to each 
<p>other who engaged in these business arrangements could renegotiate 
<p>their contracts on a regular basis depending on the volume of business 
<p>generated. It is for this reason that we require the leases or 
<p>contracts be for a term of not less than one year. (See 
<p>Secs. 1001.952(b)(4), 1001.952(c)(4), and 1001.952(d)(4).) 
<p>It has come to our attention that a small number of health care 
<p>providers believe they are complying with the literal terms of these 
<p>safe harbor provisions, but are circumventing our intent not to protect 
<p>agreements that are renegotiated based on the volume of business 
<p>generated between the parties. They believe that they are protected if 
<p>they enter into multiple agreements, each of which is for a period of 
<p>one year, but when all the agreements are viewed together 
<p>renegotiations are taking place more frequently (e.g., every month), 
<p>with the terms of the additional agreements based in part on the volume 
<p>of business being generated between the parties under existing 
<p>agreements. For example, a one year personal services contract between 
<p>a hospital and a high-volume referring physician is created for the 
<p>physician to perform certain services. The next month a new one year 
<p>contract is created for a slightly different service, with the amount 
<p>of payment influenced by the previous months referrals. 
<p>This scenario does not comply with the requirement in each of these 
<p>safe harbor provisions that the compensation not take ``into account 
<p>the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated 
<p>between the parties * * * .'' (Secs. 1001.952(b)(5), 1001.952(c)(5), 
<p>and 1001.952(d)(5)). However, because the principal problem in this 
<p>situation is that the parties are creating multiple overlapping 
<p>agreements, we are proposing to revise these three safe harbor 
<p>provisions to expressly preclude such schemes. 
<p>In addition, it appears that some health care providers are 
<p>attempting to pay for referrals by renting more space than they 
<p>actually need from referral sources. Although such an arrangement would 
<p>not fit within a safe harbor because the aggregate rental charge would 
<p>be determined in a manner that would account for the volume or value of 
<p>referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties, we are 
<p>proposing to revise the safe harbor provisions in Secs. 1001.952 
<p>(b)(5), (c)(5) and (d)(5) to expressly preclude this practice. 
<p>D. Clarifications to Referral Services Safe-Harbor (Sec. 1001.952(f)) 
<p>-- One of the standards in the referral services safe harbor 
<p>provision requires that any fee the referral service charges the 
<p>participant be ``based on the cost of operating the referral service, 
<p>and not on the volume or value of any referrals to or business 
<p>otherwise generated by the participants for the referral service * * * 
<p>.'' (Emphasis added) (Sec. 1001.952(f)(2)). This language precludes 
<p>protection where a referral service, such as one operated by a 
<p>hospital, lowers its referral service fee to one of its staff 
<p>physicians who participates in the service because that physician is a 
<p>high-volume referrer. 
<p>This language creates an ambiguity where the referral service tries 
<p>to adjust its fee based on the volume of referrals it makes to the 
<p>participant. Thus, we propose clarifying the second prong to preclude 
<p>safe harbor protection for payments that are based on the volume or 
<p>value of referrals to or business otherwise generated by either party 
<p>for the other party. 
<p>E. Clarifications To Discount Safe Harbor (Sec. 1001.952(h)) 
<p>-- Many people requested clarification of the safe harbor for 
<p>discounts. Because there has been some uncertainty over what 
<p>obligations individuals or entities have to meet in order to receive 
<p>protection under this safe harbor, we propose dividing the parties into 
<p>three groups: buyers, sellers, and offerors of discounts. In describing 
<p>each party's obligations, we would revise paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), 
<p>and add a new paragraph (h)(3). 
<p>In addition, through a proposed new paragraph (h)(4), we would 
<p>clarify that, for purposes of this regulation, a ``rebate'' is any 
<p>discount which is not given at the time of sale. Consequently, a rebate 
<p>transaction may be covered within the safe harbor if it involves a 
<p>buyer under Sec. 1001.952 (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii), but it is not 
<p>covered if it involves a buyer under Sec. 1001.952(h)(1)(iii) because, 
<p>under that provision, all discounts must be given at the time of sale. 
<p>We also wish to clarify what has to happen for sellers to receive 
<p>safe harbor protection. In the safe harbor regulation itself, we state 
<p>that discounts will be safe harbored if both the seller ``and'' the 
<p>buyer comply with the applicable standards as described in the rule. 
<p>Yet in the preamble we state that sellers should not be held liable for 
<p>the omissions of buyers. If a seller has done everything that it 
<p>reasonably could under the circumstances to ensure that the buyer 
<p>understands its obligations to accurately report the discount, the 
<p>seller is safe harbored irrespective of the omissions of the buyer. To 
<p>receive such protection, however, the seller must report the discount 
<p>to the buyer and inform the buyer of its obligation to report the 
<p>discount. To emphasize that the seller's obligations require more than 
<p>superficial compliance with the safe harbor, we propose to add to that 
<p>the seller must inform the buyer ``in an effective manner'' of its 
<p>obligations to report the discount. We also propose adding a 
<p>requirement that the seller ``refrain from doing anything that would 
<p>impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph.'' 
<p>Thus, if the seller, in good faith, meets its obligations under the 
<p>safe harbor and the buyer does not meet its obligations due to no fault 
<p>of the seller, the seller would receive safe harbor protection. 
<p>However, when the seller submits a claim or request for payment on 
<p>behalf of the buyer, the seller must fully and accurately report the 
<p>discount to Medicare or the State health care program. Likewise, when 
<p>an offeror of a discount meets its obligations under 
<p>Sec. 1001.952(h)(3), and the buyer or seller does not meet its 
<p>obligations due to no fault of the offeror, the offeror would receive 
<p>safe harbor protection. 
<p>In addition, we are proposing to clarify whether any reduction in 
<p>price offered to a beneficiary could be safe harbored under this 
<p>regulation. Congress protected ``a discount or other reduction in price 
<p>obtained by a provider of services or other entity'' (emphasis added) 
<p>and made no provision for such discounts obtained by a beneficiary. In 
<p>Sec. 1001.952(h)(3)(iv) of the regulation, we removed from safe harbor 
<p>protection a ``reduction in price offered to a beneficiary * * * .'' In 
<p>that section, all we intended to remove from this safe harbor was 
<p>``routine reduction or waiver of any coinsurance or deductible amount 
<p>owed by a program beneficiary.'' Thus, to the extent that a discount is 
<p>offered to a beneficiary and all other applicable standards in the safe 
<p>harbor are met, such a discount would receive safe harbor protection. 
<p>Many people have expressed confusion regarding the relationship 
<p>between the safe harbor for discounts and the statutory exception for 
<p>discounts. (See section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of the Act.) Specifically, we 
<p>are asked if there are any practices involving discounts which were 
<p>protected by Congress under the statutory exception which do not fit 
<p>within the safe harbor for discounts. Our intention is that all the 
<p>discounts or reductions in price that Congress intended to protect 
<p>under the statutory exception for discounts are protected under the 
<p>safe harbor for discounts. Moreover, as is illustrated by the 
<p>discussion above regarding discounts to beneficiaries, we are proposing 
<p>to expand the safe harbor for discounts to include additional practices 
<p>that we do not consider abusive. 
<p>In the preamble to the final regulation, we stated that when 
<p>reporting a discount, one only need report the actual purchase price 
<p>and note that it is a ``net discount'' (56 FR 35981). However, for 
<p>purposes of submitting a claim or request for payment, what is 
<p>necessary is that the value of the discount is accurately reflected in 
<p>the actual purchase price. It is not necessary to distinguish whether 
<p>this price is the result of a discount, or to state ``net discount.'' 
<p>Consequently, buyers who were uncertain about how and where to report 
<p>on a particular form the fact that the price was due to a discount need 
<p>not be concerned with reporting that fact, as long as the actual 
<p>purchase price accurately reflects the discount. 
<p>Finally, we are proposing some minor editorial changes that do not 
<p>affect the substance of the provision, but hopefully make it easier to 
<p>understand. 
<p>F. Technical Correction 
<p>-- A typographical error at 56 FR 35978 gave a citation to a 
<p>HCFA rule on payment for intraocular lenses as ``55 FR 436.'' We would 
<p>correct this citation to the HCFA rule to read as ``55 FR 4536.'' 
<p>-- We are proposing the deletion of Sec. 1001.953 which calls 
<p>for the completion of an OIG report on compliance with the investment 
<p>interest safe harbor at Sec. 1001.952(a)(2)(i) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vi) 
<p>within a specified period of time after publication of the original 
<p>safe harbor provisions. While the OIG is continuing its work on 
<p>evaluating this safe harbor provision, we believe completion of this 
<p>report to be an internal administrative process that need not be set 
<p>forth in the regulations. 
<p>III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<p>As we indicated in the original safe harbor final rule published on 
<p>July 29, 1991, consistent with the intent of the statute, the original 
<p>safe harbor rulemaking and these proposed clarifications are designed 
<p>to permit individuals and entities to freely engage in business 
<p>practices and arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and 
<p>economy. In doing so, the regulations impose no requirements on any 
<p>party. Health care providers and others may voluntarily seek to comply 
<p>with these provisions so that they have the assurance that their 
<p>business practices are not subject to any enforcement action under the 
<p>anti-kickback statute. We believe that the economic impact of these 
<p>provisions would be minimal. 
<p>In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<p>that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601- 
<p>612). We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this 
<p>proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a 
<p>substantial number of small business entities, and we have, therefore, 
<p>not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. <br>

<p>(a) Investment interests. * * * 
<p>(1) If, within the previous fiscal year or previous 12 month 
<p>period, the entity possesses more than $50,000,000 in undepreciated net

<p>care items and services, all of the following five applicable standards 
<p>must be met-- 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(iv) The entity or any investor (or other individual or entity 
<p>acting on behalf of the entity or any investor in the entity) must not

<p>in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or 
<p>services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity. (For 
<p>purposes of Sec. 1001.952(a)(2)(i), equivalent classes of equity 
<p>investments may be combined, and equivalent classes of debt instruments 
<p>may be combined.) 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(vi) No more than 40 percent of the entity's gross revenue related 
<p>to the furnishing of health care items and services in the previous 
<p>fiscal year or previous 12 month period may come from referrals, or

<p>(vii) The entity or any investor must not loan funds to or 
<p>guarantee a loan for an investor who is in a position to make or 
<p>influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise 
<p>generate business for the entity if the investor uses any part of such 
<p>loan to obtain the investment interest. 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(b) Space rental. * * * 
<p>(2) The lease covers all of the premises leased between the parties 
<p>for the period of the lease and specifies the premises covered by the 
<p>lease. 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(5) The aggregate space rented does not exceed that which is 
<p>reasonably necessary to accomplish the legitimate business purpose of 
<p>the rental. 
<p>(6) The aggregate rental charge is set in advance, is consistent 
<p>with fair market value in arms-length transactions and is not 
<p>determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of 
<p>any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties for 
<p>which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State 
<p>health care program. 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(c) Equipment rental.

<p>(2) The lease covers all of the equipment leased between the 
<p>parties for the period of the lease and specifies the equipment covered 
<p>by the lease. 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(5) The aggregate equipment rental does not exceed that which is 
<p>reasonably necessary to accomplish the legitimate business purpose of 
<p>the rental.

<p>are reasonably necessary to accomplish the legitimate business purpose 
<p>of the services. 
<p>(6) The aggregate compensation paid to the agent over the term of 
<p>the agreement is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value 
<p>in arms-length transactions and is not determined in a manner that 
<p>takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business 
<p>otherwise generated between the parties for which payment may be made 
<p>in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>(7) The services performed under the agreement do not involve the 
<p>counseling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity 
<p>that violates any State or Federal law.

<p>generated by either party for the other party for which payment may be 
<p>made in whole or in part under Medicare or a State health care program. 
<p>* * * * * 
<p>(h) Discounts. As used in section 1128B of the Act, 
<p>``remuneration'' does not include a discount, as defined in paragraph 
<p>(h)(5) of this section, on an item or service for which payment may be 
<p>made, in whole or in part, under Medicare or a State health care 
<p>program for a buyer as long as the buyer complies with the applicable 
<p>standards of paragraph (h)(1) of this section; a seller as long as the 
<p>seller complies with the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(2) of 
<p>this section; and an offeror of a discount who is not a seller under 
<p>paragraph (h)(2) of this section so long as such offeror complies with 
<p>the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(3) of this section: 
<p>(1) With respect to the following three categories of buyers, the 
<p>buyer must comply with all of the applicable standards within one of 
<p>the three following categories-- 
<p>(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance 
<p>organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance with a 
<p>risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under 
<p>another State health care program, it need not report the discount 
<p>except as otherwise may be required under the risk contract. 
<p>(ii) If the buyer is an entity which reports its costs on a cost 
<p>report required by the Department or a State health care program, it 
<p>must comply with all of the following four standards-- 
<p>(A) the discount must be earned based on purchases of that same 
<p>good or service bought within a single fiscal year of the buyer. 
<p>(B) the buyer must claim the benefit of the discount in the fiscal 
<p>year in which the discount is earned or the following year. 
<p>(C) the buyer must fully and accurately report the discount in the 
<p>applicable cost report; and 
<p>(D) the buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a 
<p>State agency, information provided by the seller as specified in 
<p>paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, or information provided by the 
<p>offeror as specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section. 
<p>(iii) If the buyer is an individual or entity in whose name a claim 
<p>or request for payment is submitted for an item or service for which

<p>health care program (not including individuals or entities receiving 
<p>items or services from entities defined as buyers in paragraph 
<p>(h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this section), the buyer must comply with 
<p>all of the following three standards-- 
<p>(A) the discount must be made at the time of the sale of the good 
<p>or service (rebates are therefore not allowable); 
<p>(B) where an item or service is separately claimed for payment with 
<p>the Medicare program or a State health care program, the buyer (if 
<p>submitting the claim) must fully and accurately report the discount on 
<p>that item or service; and 
<p>(C) the buyer (if submitting the claim) must provide, upon request 
<p>by the Secretary or a State agency, information provided by the seller 
<p>as specified in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, or 
<p>information provided by the offeror as specified in paragraph 
<p>(h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. 
<p>(2) The seller is an individual or entity that furnishes an item or 
<p>service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under 
<p>Medicare or a State health care program to the buyer and who permits a 
<p>discount to be taken off the buyer's purchase price. The seller must 
<p>comply with all of the applicable standards within the following three 
<p>categories-- 
<p>(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance 
<p>organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance with a 
<p>risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under 
<p>another State health care program, the seller need not report the

<p>(ii) If the buyer, is an entity that reports its costs on a cost 
<p>report required by the Department or a State agency, the seller must 
<p>comply with either of the following two standards-- 
<p>(A) where a discount is required to be reported to Medicare or a 
<p>State health care program under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
<p>seller must fully and accurately report such discount on the invoice, 
<p>coupon or statement submitted to the buyer, inform the buyer in an 
<p>effective manner of its obligations to report such discount, and 
<p>refrain from doing anything which would impede the buyer from meeting 
<p>its obligations under this paragraph; or 
<p>(B) where the value of the discount is not known at the time of 
<p>sale, the seller must fully and accurately report the existence of a 
<p>discount program on the invoice, coupon or statement submitted to the 
<p>buyer, inform the buyer in an effective manner of its obligations to

<p>the value of the discount becomes known, provide the buyer with 
<p>documentation of the calculation of the discount identifying the 
<p>specific goods or services purchased to which the discount will be 
<p>applied, and refrain from doing anything which would impede the buyer 
<p>from meeting its obligations under this paragraph. 
<p>(iii) If the buyer is an individual or entity not included in 
<p>paragraph (h)(2)(i) or (h)(2)(ii) of this section, the seller must 
<p>comply with either of the following two standards-- 
<p>(A) where the seller submits a claim or request for payment on 
<p>behalf of the buyer and the item or service is separately claimed, the 
<p>seller must fully and accurately report the discount on the claim or 
<p>request for payment to Medicare or a State health care program and the 
<p>seller must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, 
<p>information provided by the offeror as specified in paragraph 
<p>(h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section; or

<p>accurately report such discount on the invoice, coupon or statement 
<p>submitted to the buyer; inform the buyer in an effective manner of its 
<p>obligations to report such discount; and refrain from doing anything 
<p>that would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this 
<p>paragraph. 
<p>(3) The offeror of a discount is an individual or entity who is not 
<p>a seller under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, but promotes the 
<p>purchase of an item or service by a buyer under paragraph (h)(1) of 
<p>this section at a reduced price for which payment may be made, in whole 
<p>or in part, under Medicare or a State health care program. The offeror 
<p>must comply with all of the applicable standards within the following 
<p>three categories-- 
<p>(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance 
<p>organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance with a 
<p>risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under 
<p>another State health care program, the offeror need not report the 
<p>discount to the buyer for purposes of this provision. 
<p>(ii) If the buyer is an entity that reports its costs on a cost 
<p>report required by the Department or a State agency, the offeror must

<p>(A) the offeror must inform the buyer in an effective manner of its 
<p>obligation to report such a discount; and 
<p>(B) the offeror of the discount must refrain from doing anything 
<p>that would impede the buyer's ability to meet its obligations under 
<p>this paragraph. 
<p>(iii) If the buyer is an individual or entity in whose name a 
<p>request for payment is submitted for an item or service for which 
<p>payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare or a State

<p>offeror must comply with the following two standards-- 
<p>(A) the offeror must inform the individual or entity submitting the 
<p>claim or request for payment in an effective manner of their 
<p>obligations to report such a discount; and 
<p>(B) the offeror of the discount must refrain from doing anything 
<p>that would impede the buyer's or seller's ability to meet its 
<p>obligations under this paragraph. 
<p>(4) For purposes of this paragraph (a), a rebate is any discount 
<p>which is not given at the time of sale. 
<p>(5) For purposes of this paragraph (a), the term discount means a 
<p>reduction in the amount a buyer (who buys either directly or through a 
<p>wholesaler or a group purchasing organization) is charged for an item 
<p>or service based on an arms-length transaction. The term discount does 
<p>not include-- 
<p>(i) Cash payment; 
<p>(ii) Furnishing one good or service without charge or at a reduced 
<p>charge to include the purchase of a different good or service; 
<p>(iii) A reduction in price applicable to one payer but not to
