<p> Re: "Up-front Rebates," "Prebates," and "Signing Bonus" Payments 
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>We are writing in response to your letter requesting clarification regarding 
  the legality of up-front and percentage payments in connection with medical 
  supply contracts. Specifically, you have asked whether arrangements involving 
  advance contractual payments, variously described as (i) "up-front rebates", 
  (ii) "signing bonuses", and (iii) "prebates", implicate the Medicare and Medicaid 
  anti-kickback statute (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b)). 
<p>You described the following situation. A manufacturer or distributor of various 
  medical products and services (the "Seller") enters into contracts with group 
  purchasing organizations and end-users of those products (the "Purchasers"). 
  The Seller agrees to pay substantial up-front payments to the Purchasers upon 
  execution of the contract and may provide for additional advance payments to 
  be made at various times during the terms of the contracts. The contracts would 
  not provide for any refund to the Seller upon failure of the Purchasers to satisfy 
  any minimum purchase requirements and may establish an exclusive purchasing 
  relationship between the parties. 
<p>As you have not requested a formal advisory opinion, we cannot opine on the 
  legality of the particular arrangements described in your letter. However, we 
  can make some general observations regarding the anti-kickback statute's applicability 
  to the payment arrangements described. 
<p>In general, the practices described in your letter raise issues under the anti-kickback 
  statute, because the payments (i.e., remuneration) are obviously incentives 
  to induce the purchase of items or services, some of which are Federally reimbursable. 
  The payments would not be covered by the discount safe harbor, which applies 
  to certain discounts and rebates (42 C.F.R. &#167;1001.952(h)), because they 
  are made prior to any purchase and are not attributable to identifiable purchases 
  of items or services. Simply put, discounts are price reductions at the time 
  of sale of goods, and rebates are discounts subsequent to the sale. Moreover, 
  these practices appear to pose a significant risk of fraud and abuse. Not only 
  are such payments difficult to trace to ensure proper disclosure, but they also 
  have the practical effects of "locking in" the purchasers for an extended period 
  of time, increasing the potential for overutilization and interfering with a 
  purchaser's normal cost/quality considerations in ordering specific goods or 
  services. Accordingly, up-front rebates, prebates, signing bonuses, and similar 
  payments are suspect under the anti-kickback statute, placing persons offering 
  or receiving them potentially at risk. 
<p>For advice concerning the application of the anti-kickback statute to a specific 
  arrangement that either is in existence or is one the requestor in good faith 
  plans to undertake, this office has established a formal advisory opinion procedure. 
  <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. 
<p>We hope this information is helpful. I appreciate your bringing the practices 
  described in your letter to our attention.&nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Sincerely, <br wp="br1">
