<p>Mr. T. J. Sullivan 
<p>Technical Assistant (Health Care Industries) 
<p>Office of the Associate Chief Counsel 
<p>(Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations) 
<p>Internal Revenue Service 
<p>Washington, D.C. 20224 
<p>Dear Mr. Sullivan: 
<p>You have informally inquired about our views concerning the application of 
  the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b), to certain 
  types of situations involving the acquisition of physician practices. In the 
  situations in question, the physician practices would be acquired either by 
  a hospital or by another entity which would also acquire one or more hospitals 
  (and potentially other health care providers as well). The physicians from these 
  practices would continue to treat patients and be affiliated (through an employment 
  relationship or otherwise) with the hospital or other entity which acquired 
  their practices. The acquisition of the physician practices could arise through 
  a number of different methods or arrangements and the resulting or ensuing relationships 
  or affiliations could vary. However, the end result in each case would be the 
  common ownership or control of both hospitals and physician practices by a single 
  entity. We are responding to your inquiry in general terms and not in reference 
  to any specific fact pattern(s). 
<p>Typically, in the case of the acquisition of a physician practice by a hospital 
  or other entity, there is a large, up front payment to the physician, often 
  of many hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. This sum is asserted to be 
  payment for the purchase of the assets of the practice. There are also payments 
  made to the physician subsequent to the sale of the practice where the physician 
  becomes employed by the hospital or entity or otherwise enters into a contract 
  to provide services to patients. These payments are asserted to be compensation 
  for services rendered to patients by the physician. 
<p>As you know, the anti-kickback statute provides for penalties against anyone 
  who knowingly and willfully solicits, receives, offers or pays remuneration, 
  in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for: 
<p>A. referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for 
  the furnishing of any item or service payable under the Medicare or Medicaid 
  programs, or 
<p>B. purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, 
  leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item payable under the Medicare 
  or Medicaid programs. 
<p>Persons who violate the anti-kickback statute are subject to criminal penalties 
  and/or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The 
  anti-kickback statute sets forth certain specific exceptions to the general 
  prohibition against remuneration, and specifically authorizes this Department 
  to promulgate, by regulation, additional payment practices (known as "safe harbors") 
  which will be immune from prosecution. The Department published final "safe 
  harbor" regulations on July 29, 1991 (42 C.F.R. 1001.952, 56 Fed. Reg. 35,952) 
  setting forth eleven regulatory exceptions to the anti-kickback statute. Among 
  the safe harbors included in the regulations were provisions relating to employees 
  and sale of practitioner practices. Additional safe harbor provisions relating 
  to "managed care" entities were published as final regulations (with comment 
  period) on November 5, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 52,723). 
<p>We have significant concerns under the anti-kickback statute about the type 
  of physician practice acquisitions described in your inquiry to us. Frequently, 
  hospitals seek to purchase physician practices as a means to retain existing 
  referrals or to attract new referrals of patients to the hospital. Such purchases 
  implicate the anti-kickback statute because the remuneration paid for the practice 
  can constitute illegal remuneration to induce the referral of business reimbursed 
  by the Medicare or Medicaid programs.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
<p>We believe the same concerns raised by hospital purchases of physician practices 
  could also arise where another entity (such as a foundation) purchases a physician 
  practice, when such foundation also owns or operates a hospital which benefits 
  from referrals from those physicians. 
<p>In particular, we are concerned that the remuneration paid in connection with 
  or as a result of the acquisition of a physician's practice could serve to interfere 
  with the physician's subsequent judgment of what is the most appropriate care 
  for a patient. The remuneration could result in the delivery of inappropriate 
  care to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries by inducing the physician to utilize 
  the affiliated hospital rather than another hospital or less costly facility 
  which may provide better or more appropriate care. It could also have the effect 
  of inflating costs to the Medicare or Medicaid programs by causing physicians 
  to overuse inappropriately the services of a particular hospital (or other affiliated 
  provider). This higher cost could occur directly because of the higher rates 
  of that hospital or the ordering of unnecessary serviced or indirectly as a 
  result of lessened competition in the marketplace. Finally, these arrangements 
  could significantly interfere with a beneficiary's freedom of choice of providers. 
  All these considerations are the very abuses that the antikickback statute was 
  designed to prevent. We recently addressed these same types of possible abuses 
  in an Office of Inspector General Special Fraud Alert entitled "Hospital Incentives 
  to Physicians". A copy of that Fraud Alert is enclosed for your information. 
<p>The following are specific aspects of physician practice acquisition or subsequent 
  activities that may implicate or result in violations of the anti-kickback statute. 
  Our comments focus primarily on two broad issue categories: (1) the total amount 
  paid for the physician practice and the nature and type of items for which the 
  physician receives payment; and (2) the amount and manner in which the physician 
  is subsequently compensated for providing services to patients.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
<p>Under the anti-kickback statute, either of the above categories of payment 
  could constitute illegal remuneration. This is because under the anti-kickback 
  statute, the statute is violated if "one purpose" of the payment is to induce 
  the referral of future Medicare or Medicaid program business. <u>United States 
  v. Greber</u>, 760 F.2d 68, 69 (3rd Cir. 1985) <u>cert. denied</u>, 474 U.S. 
  988 (1985); <u>United States v. Kats</u>, 871 F.2d 105, 108 (9th Cir. 1989). 
  Thus, it is necessary to scrutinize the payments (including the surrounding 
  facts and circumstances) to determine the purpose for which they have been made. 
  As part of this undertaking, it is necessary to consider the amounts paid for 
  the practice or as compensation to determine whether they reasonably reflect 
  the <u>fair market value</u> of the practice or the services rendered, in order 
  to determine whether such items in reality constitute remuneration for referrals. 
  Moreover, to the extent that a payment exceeds the fair market value of the 
  practice or the value of the services rendered, it can be inferred that the 
  excess amount paid over fair market value is intended as payment for the referral 
  of program-related business. <u>United States v. Lipkis</u>, 770 F.2d 1447 (9th 
  Cir. 1985). 
<p>When considering the question of fair market value, we would note that the 
  traditional or common methods of economic valuation do not comport with the 
  prescriptions of the anti-kickback statute. Items ordinarily considered in determining 
  the fair market value may be expressly barred by the anti-kickback statute's 
  prohibition against payments for referrals. Merely because another buyer may 
  be willing to pay a particular price is not sufficient to render the price paid 
  to be fair market value. The fact that a buyer in a position to benefit from 
  referrals is willing to pay a particular price may only be a reflection of the 
  value of the referral stream that is likely to result from the purchase.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
<p>Accordingly, when attempting to assess the fair market value (as that term 
  is used in an anti-kickback analysis) attributable to a physician's practice, 
  it may be necessary to exclude from consideration any amounts which reflect, 
  facilitate or otherwise relate to the continuing treatment of the former practice's 
  patients. This would be because any such items only have value with respect 
  to the on-going flow of business to the practice. It is doubtful whether this 
  value may be paid by a party who could expect to benefit from referrals from 
  that ongoing practice.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Such amounts could 
  be considered as payments for referrals. Thus, any amount paid in excess of 
  the fair market value of the hard assets of a physician practice would be open 
  to question. Similarly, in determining the fair market value of services rendered 
  by employee or contract physicians, it may be necessary to exclude from consideration 
  any amounts which reflect or relate to past or future referrals or any amounts 
  which reflect or are affected by the expectation or guarantee of a certain volume 
  of business (by either the physician or the hospital). Specific items that we 
  believe would raise a question as to whether payment was being made for the 
  value of a referral stream would include, among other things: 
<p>-- payment for goodwill, 
<p>-- payment for value of ongoing business unit, 
<p>-- payment for covenants not to compete, 
<p>-- payment for exclusive dealing agreements, 
<p>-- payment for patient lists, or 
<p>-- payment for patient records. 
<p>Payments for the above types of assets or items are questionable where, as 
  is the case here, there is a continuing relationship between the buyer and the 
  seller and the buyer relies (at least in part) on referrals from the seller. 
<p>We believe a very revealing inquiry would be to compare the financial welfare 
  of the physicians involved before and after the acquisition. (One can expect 
  to find projections on this subject among materials given to prospective physician 
  participants in these arrangements.) If the economic position of these physicians 
  is expected to significantly improve as a result of the acquisition, it is likely 
  that a purpose of the acquisition is to offer remuneration for the referrals 
  which these physicians can make to the buyer. Another revealing inquiry would 
  be to compare referral patterns before and after the acquisition, specifically, 
  whether the sellers become increasingly "loyal" to the buyer. (Obviously, this 
  inquiry would only occur if the acquisition took place, but it is a potential 
  topic to study in the future to the extent acquisitions occur and are subject 
  to audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service.) 
<p>In sum, these arrangements raise grave questions of compliance with the anti-kickback 
  statute. We believe that many of these arrangements are merely sophisticated 
  disguises to share the profits of business at a hospital with referring physicians, 
  in order to induce the physicians to steer referrals to the hospital. 
<p>We hope this letter has provided helpful information in response to your informal 
  inquiry.

<p>FOOTNOTES: 
<p>1. Since tax exempt hospitals are generally required to participate in the 
  Medicare and-Medicaid programs as a condition of obtaining or maintaining their 
  tax exempt status, the antikickback statute is necessarily a significant issue 
  to be addressed by them. <a name="N_2_"></a> 
<p>2. We would also note that while the anti-kickback statute contains a statutory 
  exemption for payments made to employees by an employer, the exemption does 
  not cover any and all such payments. Specifically, the statute exempts only 
  payments to employees which are for "the provision of covered items or services". 
  Accordingly, since referrals do not represent covered items or services, payments 
  to employees which are for the purpose of compensating such employees for the 
  referral of patients would likely not be covered by the employee exemption. 
  <a name="N_3_"></a> 
<p>3. This deviation from the normal "economic" model was made expressly clear 
  in the safe harbor provisions. For purposes of determining the value of space 
  or equipment rentals, "fair market value" is specifically defined to exclude 
  the "additional value one party . . . would attribute to the property [equipment] 
  as a result of its proximity or convenience to sources of referrals or business 
  otherwise generated". 42 C.F.R. 1001.952(b) and (c), 56 Fed. Reg. 35971-35973, 
  35985. <a name="N_4_"></a> 
<p>4. We note that these physician practice acquisitions do not fall within the 
  parameters of the existing safe harbor provisions on the sale of practitioner 
  practices. In the final safe harbor regulations, we expressly declined to expand 
  the scope of the safe harbor to cover purchases of physician practices by hospitals 
  or other types of entities or to situations where the seller remains in a continuing 
  position to make referrals or influence referrals to the buyer because of our 
  concerns that many of such purchases were in fact merely attempts to provide 
  remuneration in return for a future stream of referrals. <u>See</u> Preamble 
  to the final safe harbor regulations, 56 Fed. Reg. at 35975. We also attempted 
  to deal with arrangements which have the potential to lock in a referral stream 
  in the safe harbor provisions dealing with joint ventures. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
  1001.952(a), 56 Fed. Reg. 35,984-85.
