<p align="center"><big><strong>FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK LAW AND REGULATORY SAFE HARBORS</strong></big></p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>Overview: </strong>On the books since 1972, the federal 
  anti-kickback law's main purpose is to protect patients and the federal health 
  care programs from fraud and abuse by curtailing the corrupting influence of 
  money on health care decisions. Straightforward but broad, the law states that 
  anyone who knowingly and willfully receives or pays anything of value to influence 
  the referral of federal health care program business, including Medicare and 
  Medicaid, can be held accountable for a felony. Violations of the law are punishable 
  by up to five years in prison, criminal fines up to $25,000, administrative 
  civil money penalties up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in federal 
  health care programs.</em> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <em>Because the law is broad on its face, concerns arose among health care providers 
  that some relatively innocuous -- and in some cases even beneficial -- commercial 
  arrangements are prohibited by the anti-kickback law. Responding to these concerns, 
  Congress in 1987 authorized the Department to issue regulations designating 
  specific &quot;safe harbors&quot; for various payment and business practices 
  that, while potentially prohibited by the law, would not be prosecuted. </em><br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <em>The Office of Inspector General has previously published 13 regulatory safe 
  harbors, 11 in 1991 and two in 1992. A new final rule scheduled for publication 
  in the Nov. 19, 1999, </em>Federal Register<em> will establish eight new safe-harbor 
  provisions and clarify six of the original 11 safe harbors published in 1991. 
  These proposals were published in the Federal Register in 1993 and 1994 and 
  have been significantly modified in response to voluminous public comments. 
  Additionally, an interim final rule establishing a safe harbor for shared-risk 
  arrangements is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 19, 1999, </em>Federal 
  Register.<em> After publication of the two new rules, there will be a total 
  of 23 anti-kickback safe harbors consolidated in the Code of Federal Regulations 
  in 21 subparagraphs.</em> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>SAFE HARBORS GENERALLY</strong><br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Safe harbors immunize certain payment and business practices that are implicated 
  by the anti-kickback statute from criminal and civil prosecution under the statute. 
  To be protected by a safe harbor, an arrangement must fit squarely in the safe 
  harbor. Failure to comply with a safe harbor provision does not mean that an 
  arrangement is <em>per se</em> illegal. Compliance with safe harbors is voluntary, 
  and arrangements that do not comply with a safe harbor must be analyzed on a 
  case-by-case basis for compliance with the anti-kickback statute. Parties who 
  are uncertain whether their arrangements qualify for safe harbor protection 
  may request an advisory opinion. Instructions on how to request an advisory 
  opinion are available on the Internet at <em><a

<p align="left"><strong>THE 13 EXISTING SAFE HARBORS</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The 1991 safe harbors addressed the following types of business or payment practices: 
  investments in large publicly held health care companies; investments in small 
  health care joint ventures; space rental; equipment rental; personal services 
  and management contracts; sales of retiring physicians' practices to other physicians; 
  referral services; warranties; discounts; employee compensation; group purchasing 
  organizations; and waivers of Medicare Part A inpatient cost-sharing amounts. 
  The 1992 interim final safe harbors, which were finalized in 1996, addressed 
  the following practices in managed care settings: increased coverage, reduced 
  cost-sharing amounts, or reduced premium amounts offered by health plans to 
  beneficiaries; and price reductions offered to health plans by providers. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>THE NEW SAFE HARBORS</strong> </p>
<p>The preamble to the new final rule includes a summary of each proposal from 
  1993 and 1994, a summary of each new safe harbor, and the Office of Inspector 
  General's response to public comments on each topic area. The new safe harbors 
  address the following areas: investments in underserved areas; practitioner 
  recruitment in underserved areas; obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies 
  for underserved areas; sales of practices to hospitals in underserved areas; 
  investments in ambulatory surgical centers; investments in group practices; 
  referral arrangements for specialty services; and cooperative hospital service 
  organizations<strong>.</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Investments in Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs)</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The original proposal protected only Medicare-certified ASCs wholly owned by 
  surgeons. Many in the industry urged that the original proposal be broadened. 
  The expanded final rule protects certain investment interests in four categories 
  of freestanding Medicare-certified ASCs: surgeon-owned ASCs; single-specialty 
  ASCs (e.g., all gastroenterologists); multi-specialty ASCs (e.g., a mix of surgeons 
  and gastroenterologists); and hospital/physician-owned ASCs. In general, to 
  be protected, physician investors must be physicians for whom the ASC is an 
  extension of their office practice pursuant to conditions set forth in the safe 
  harbor. Hospital investors must not be in a position to make or influence referrals. 
  Certain investors who are not existing or potential referral sources are permitted. 
  The ASC safe harbor does not apply to other physician-owned clinical joint ventures, 
  such as cardiac catheterization labs, end-stage renal dialysis facilities or 
  radiation oncology facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Ventures in Underserved Areas</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Often health care ventures in medically underserved areas have difficulty attracting 
  needed capital, and, often, the best available sources of capital are local 
  physicians. Many underserved area ventures cannot fit in the existing safe harbor 
  for small entity joint ventures because that safe harbor limits physician ownership 
  and the revenues that can be derived from referrals from physician investors. 
  The underserved area joint venture safe harbor relaxes several of the conditions 
  of the existing joint venture safe harbor. The new safe harbor permits a higher 
  percentage of physician investors -- up to 50 percent -- and unlimited revenues 
  from referral source investors. The new safe harbor expands on the 1993 proposal 
  by including joint ventures in underserved urban, as well as rural, areas. To 
  qualify, a venture must be located in a medically underserved area, as defined 
  by Department regulation, and serve 75 percent medically underserved patients. 
  <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Practitioner Recruitment in Underserved Areas</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  This safe harbor protects recruitment payments made by entities to attract needed 
  physicians and other health care professionals to rural and urban health professional 
  shortage areas (HPSAs), as designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration. 
  The safe harbor requires that at least 75 percent of the recruited practitioner's 
  revenue be from patients who reside in HSPAs or medically underserved areas 
  or are members of medically underserved populations, such as the homeless or 
  migrant workers. The safe harbor limits the duration of payments to three years. 
  The safe harbor does not prescribe the types of protected payments, such as 
  income guarantees or moving expenses, leaving that determination to negotiation 
  by the parties. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Because of the risk of disguised payments for referrals, the safe harbor does 
  not protect payments made by hospitals to existing group practices to recruit 
  physicians to join the group, nor does it protect payments to retain existing 
  practitioners. Such arrangements remain subject to case-by-case review under 
  the anti-kickback statute. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Sales of Physician Practices to Hospitals in Underserved Areas</strong> 
  <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  This safe harbor protects hospitals in HPSAs that buy and &quot;hold&quot; the 
  practice of a retiring physician until a new physician can be recruited to replace 
  the retiring one. To qualify for safe harbor protection, the sale must be completed 
  within three years, and the hospital must engage in good faith efforts to recruit 
  a new practitioner. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Subsidies for Obstetrical Malpractice Insurance in Underserved Areas</strong> 
  <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  This safe harbor protects a hospital or other entity that pays all or part of 
  the malpractice insurance premiums for practitioners engaging in obstetrical 
  practice in HPSAs. To qualify for protection, at least 75 percent of the subsidized 
  practitioners' patients must be medically underserved patients. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Investments in Group Practices</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  This safe harbor protects investments by physicians in their own group practices, 
  if the group practice meets the physician self-referral (Stark) law definition 
  of a group practice. The safe harbor also protects investments in solo practices 
  where the practice is conducted through the solo practitioner's professional 
  corporation or other separate legal entity. The safe harbor does not protect 
  investments by group practices or members of group practices in ancillary services' 
  joint ventures, although such joint ventures may qualify for protection under 
  other safe harbors. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Specialty Referral Arrangements Between Providers </strong><br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The safe harbor protects certain arrangements when an individual or entity agrees 
  to refer a patient to another individual or entity for specialty services in 
  return for the party receiving the referral to refer the patient back at a certain 
  time or under certain circumstances. For example, a primary care physician and 
  a specialist to whom the primary care physician has made a referral may agree 
  that, when the referred patient reaches a particular stage of recovery, the 
  primary care physician should resume treatment of the patient. The safe harbor 
  does not protect arrangements involving parties that split a global fee from 
  a federal program. The safe harbor requires that referrals be clinically appropriate, 
  rather than based on arbitrary dates or time frames. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Cooperative Hospital Services Organizations</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  This safe harbor protects cooperative hospital service organizations (CHSOs) 
  that qualify under section 501(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. CHSOs are organizations 
  formed by two or more tax-exempt hospitals, known as &quot;patron hospitals,&quot; 
  to provide specifically enumerated services, such as purchasing, billing, and 
  clinical services solely for the benefit of patron hospitals. The safe harbor 
  will protect payments from a patron hospital to a CHSO to support the CHSO's 
  operational costs and payments from a CHSO to a patron hospital that are required 
  by IRS rules.</p>
<p><strong>CLARIFICATION OF EXISTING SAFE HARBORS</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The new final rule clarifies aspects of the original safe harbors for large 
  and small entity investments; space rental; equipment rental; personal services 
  and management contracts; referral services; and discounts. Many of the changes 
  are technical in nature. The intent of the clarifications is to make the regulations 
  easier for the industry to understand and apply to particular factual circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of Proposed &quot;Sham&quot; Transactions Rule</strong><br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Office of Inspector General elected not to adopt the &quot;sham&quot; transactions 
  rule proposed in the 1994 proposed regulation. However, the preamble to the 
  new rule makes clear that safe harbors only protect arrangements if the form 
  and substance of the transaction conform to the safe harbor in which shelter 
  is sought. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>SHARED-RISK SAFE HARBORS</strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In 1996, Congress enacted a new exception to the anti-kickback statute for certain 
  shared-risk arrangements and directed the Department to issue regulations through 
  a negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiating committee, composed of industry 
  and government representatives, issued a joint committee statement in January 
  1998 that describes the agreement reached by the committee and served as a guideline 
  for the government's rulemaking. The interim final rule with comment period 
  for the shared-risk exception is also scheduled for publication in the Nov. 
  19, 1999, <em>Federal Register.</em></p>
