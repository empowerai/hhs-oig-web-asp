<p>[Name and Address redacted] 
<p>Re: Free Computers, Facsimile Machines and Other Goods <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p>Dear [Name redacted]: 
<p>This letter is in response to your letter of April 3, 1997, concerning the 
  provision of certain free goods and services. Specifically, your letter requested 
  guidance as to whether the provision of free fax machines, free computers and 
  free fax lines by a supplier of transtelephonic monitoring services to physicians 
  who refer patients to such supplier implicates the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback 
  statute. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b). 
<p>This office has established a procedure for formally responding to requests 
  for advice concerning the anti-kickback statute for a specific arrangement that 
  either is in existence or is one in which the requester in good faith plans 
  to undertake. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 1008.15; 62 Fed. Reg. 7350, 7358. 
  The request for such an opinion must come from a party that is a participant 
  in the arrangement. Since your request does not concern a particular arrangement, 
  we cannot provide you with a formal opinion. However, we can make some general 
  observations regarding the practices described. 
<p>In general, the anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense to knowingly 
  and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce, or 
  in return for, the referral of items or services for which payment may be made 
  in whole or in part by a Federal health care program. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b). 
  In other words, the statute prohibits payments made purposefully in exchange 
  for referrals of business which is paid for by a Federal health care program. 
  Violation of the anti-kickback statute is a felony punishable by a maximum fine 
  of $25,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The Department of Health 
  and Human Services may also exclude individuals who violate the anti-kickback 
  statute from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
<p>The OIG has stated on numerous occasions its view that the provision of free 
  goods by a seller to an actual or potential referral source can violate the 
  anti-kickback statute depending on the circumstances. For example, with respect 
  to free computers, we observed in the preamble to the 1991 safe harbor regulations: 
<p>"A related issue is the practice of giving away free computers. In some cases 
  the computer can only be used as part of a particular service that is being 
  provided, for example, printing out the results of laboratory tests. In this 
  situation, it appears that the computer has no independent value apart from 
  the service being provided and that the purpose of the free computer is not 
  to induce an act prohibited by the statute. . . . In contrast, sometimes the 
  computer that is given away is a regular personal computer, which the physician 
  is free to use for a variety of purposes in addition to receiving test results. 
  In that situation the computer has a definite value to the physician, and, depending 
  on the circumstances, may well constitute an illegal inducement." 56 Fed. Reg. 
  35978 (July 29,1991) 
<p>We are aware that many suppliers, not simply transtelephonic monitoring suppliers, 
  are providing various kinds of multi-use equipment to customers pursuant to 
  various written and unwritten arrangements, typically with a condition that 
  such equipment is only to be used in connection with their service. However, 
  in determining whether a free or "loaner" computer or fax machine constitutes 
  illegal remuneration, the substance -- not the form -- of the transaction controls 
  and any reasonably foreseeable "misuse" of the equipment implicates the entity 
  providing the equipment as well as the user. Simply put, if the equipment is 
  used by the recipient for any purpose other than in connection with the ordered 
  service, there is potential illegal remuneration and potential liability for 
  both parties to the transaction. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
<p>Frankly, we are concerned that many of these arrangements are shams. Not only 
  is there often no substantial business need for the equipment, but also there 
  is no attempt to police the arrangement to ensure that the "restrictions" are 
  being followed. While it may theoretically be possible to conceive an arrangement 
  in which such general purpose equipment would have no independent value to the 
  referral source, we view all such arrangements with skepticism. In particular, 
  we examine 
<p>-- the criteria used by the supplier of the equipment to determine which customers 
  receive the equipment; 
<p>-- the ownership of the equipment; 
<p>-- the location and access to the equipment at the customer's place of business; 
<p>-- the procedures used by the customer and supplier to police unauthorized 
  use of the equipment; 
<p>-- the value added to the core service being provided by the additional general 
  purpose equipment; and 
<p>-- the number and extent of similar arrangements with other parties. 
<p>Finally, we point out that in addition to potential criminal liability under 
  the anti-kickback statute, there is legal authority that any claim tainted by 
  a kickback arrangement is a "false or fraudulent" claim under the Federal False 
  Claims Act,<strong> </strong>31 U.S.C. 3729, <u>et seq</u>. <u>See U.S. ex rel. 
  Pogue v. American Healthcorp. Inc.,<strong></strong></u> 914 F. Supp. 1507 (M.D. 
  Tenn. 1996). Parties to such arrangements risk exposure not only to the government 
  but also to <em>qui tam </em>suits by their employees and customers' employees. 
<p>If you can provide us with specific details on the particular parties involved 
  and the arrangements into which they have entered, we will pass the information 
  along to the investigative branch in the appropriate region. 
<p>Very truly yours, 
<p>/s/

<p>Chief, Industry Guidance Branch
