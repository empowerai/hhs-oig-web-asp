  Dear [Name redacted]: <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We are writing in response to your inquiry regarding the potential applicability 
  of the Federal anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), to a proposed 
  arrangement among three nephrologists to establish and own a home dialysis supply 
  company (the &quot;Company&quot;). According to the information you have provided, 
  the Company would be managed by a competing supplier of home dialysis supplies 
  (&quot;Management Company&quot;) paid a percentage of the Company's revenues. 
  A substantial portion of the Company's business would be derived from referrals 
  of dialysis patients from the investing nephrologists. </p>
<p>We cannot provide a formal binding opinion except through our advisory opinion 
  process. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. Part 1008. However, we can make some general observations 
  regarding the practices you have described. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In general, the anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal offense knowingly 
  and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce, 
  or in return for, the referral of items or services for which payment may be 
  made in whole or in part by a Federal health care program. In other words, the 
  statute prohibits payments made purposefully to induce referrals of business 
  payable by a Federal health care program. Violation of the anti-kickback statute 
  is a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000, imprisonment up to five 
  years, or both. The Department of Health and Human Services may also impose 
  civil monetary penalties on or exclude persons who violate the anti-kickback 
  statute. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In 1989, the Office of Inspector General issued a &quot;Special Fraud Alert&quot; 
  specifically discussing joint venture arrangements that may violate the anti-kickback 
  statute (Special Fraud Alert, &quot;Joint Venture Arrangements&quot; (OIG-89-4), 
  <u>reprinted</u> <u>in</u> 59 Fed. Reg. 65373 (Dec.19, 1994)). The Special Fraud 
  Alert distinguishes between legitimate joint ventures and those that are suspect 
  under the anti-kickback statute. A joint venture may be suspect when physicians 
  are both investors in the joint venture and are in a position to refer to the 
  joint venture. Under these circumstances, remuneration paid to the physicians 
  in exchange for referrals may be disguised as profit distributions. Such suspect 
  joint ventures: 
<ol>
  <p>. . . may be intended not so much to raise investment capital legitimately 
    to start a business, but to lock up a stream of referrals from the physician 
    investors and to compensate them indirectly for these referrals. Because physician 
    investors can benefit financially from their referrals, unnecessary procedures 
    and tests may be ordered or performed, resulting in unnecessary program expenditures.</p>
</ol>
<p>59 Fed. Reg. at 65373-74. Substantial ownership by investors who are in a position 
  to refer patients to the joint venture is an indicator of a suspect joint venture 
  because such ownership increases the likelihood that one of the joint venture's 
  purposes is to control a stream of referrals and compensate the referring investors 
  indirectly for their referrals. Other factors that could indicate potentially 
  unlawful activity include an investor in a position to refer business receiving 
  a disproportionate return on his or her investment, and participation in the 
  joint venture by an on-going entity that is already engaged in the same line 
  of business as the joint venture. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In 1991, the Department of Health and Human Services (&quot;Department&quot;) 
  published safe harbor regulations that define certain practices not subject 
  to the anti-kickback statute because such arrangements would be unlikely to 
  result in fraud or abuse. Rather, the safe harbors set forth specific conditions 
  that, if fully met, assure the entities involved of not being prosecuted or 
  sanctioned for the arrangement qualifying for the safe harbor. One safe harbor 
  regulation addresses investment interests in small entities. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. 
  § 1001.952(a)(2). The safe harbor for investments in small entities has eight 
  elements, each of which must be satisfied in order for the arrangement to qualify 
  for the exception. One specific element of the safe harbor that is not met by 
  the arrangement described requires that no more than forty percent of the investment 
  interests may be held by investors who are in a position to make or influence 
  referrals to, furnish items or services to, or generate business for, the entity. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Even though an arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor, it does not necessarily 
  violate the anti-kickback statute. Arrangements that potentially implicate the 
  anti-kickback statute, but that are not within a safe harbor, must be analyzed 
  on a case-by-case basis. In general, health care joint ventures in which investors 
  are also sources of referrals or suppliers of items or services to the joint 
  venture raise many questions under the anti-kickback statute. Like any kickback 
  scheme, these arrangements can lead to overutilization, increased costs for 
  Federal health care programs, corruption of professional judgment, and unfair 
  competition. With respect to joint ventures, one major concern is that the profit 
  distributions to investors in the joint venture who are also referral sources 
  to the joint venture may potentially represent remuneration for those referrals. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The arrangement described in your letter has many of the hallmarks of a suspect 
  joint venture. 
<ul>
  <li>All investors are physicians in a position to refer patients to the Company.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Referrals from the physician investors will constitute the majority of the 
    Company's business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Because the physicians own 100% of the Company, the return on their investments 
    will be directly related to their referrals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The &quot;management company&quot; that actually operates the Company is 
    an on-going entity already engaged in the home dialysis supply business.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Moreover, the Company would appear to pose some of the very risks 
  that the anti-kickback statute is designed to combat. Because home dialysis 
  supplies are reimbursed on a reasonable charge basis (subject to a monthly cap), 
  there is a risk of increased costs to the Federal health care programs. More 
  troubling is the possibility that the physicians' financial interest in home 
  dialysis might influence the type of dialysis treatment recommended to the patient. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Accordingly, we would view such an arrangement as suspect. The physicians' return 
  on their investment may constitute prohibited remuneration under the anti-kickback 
  statute if one purpose of the remuneration is to secure referrals of Federal 
  program business. <br
