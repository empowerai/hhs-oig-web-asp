<p><strong>PHYSICIAN LIABILITY FOR CERTIFICATIONS IN THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL 
  EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES AND HOME HEALTH SERVICES</strong> </p>
<p>
<hr>
January 1999 
<p><strong>T</strong>he Office of Inspector General (OIG) was established at the 
  Department of Health and Human Services by Congress in 1976 to identify and 
  eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the Department's programs and to promote 
  efficiency and economy in departmental operations. The OIG carries out this 
  mission through a nationwide program of audits, inspections, and investigations. 
<p>To reduce fraud and abuse in the Federal health care programs, including Medicare 
  and Medicaid, the OIG actively investigates fraudulent schemes that obtain money 
  from these programs and, when appropriate, issues Special Fraud Alerts that 
  identify segments of the health care industry that are particularly vulnerable 
  to abuse. Copies of all OIG Special Fraud Alerts are available on the internet 
  at: 
<p align="center"><strong>http://www.dhhs.gov/progorg/oig/frdalrt/index.htm</strong> 
<p>We are issuing this Fraud Alert because physicians may not appreciate the legal 
  and programmatic significance of certifications they make in connection with 
  the ordering of certain items and services for their Medicare patients. While 
  the OIG believes that the actual incidence of physicians' intentionally submitting 
  false or misleading certifications of medical necessity for durable medical 
  equipment or home health care is relatively infrequent, physician laxity in 
  reviewing and completing these certifications contributes to fraudulent and 
  abusive practices by unscrupulous suppliers and home health providers. We urge 
  physicians and their staff to report any suspicious activity in connection with 
  the solicitation or completion of certifications to the OIG. 
<p>Physicians should also be aware that they are subject to substantial criminal, 
  civil, and administrative penalties if they sign a certification knowing that 
  the information relating to medical necessity is false, or with reckless disregard 
  as to the truth of the information being submitted. While a physician's signature 
  on a false or misleading certification made through mistake, simple negligence, 
  or inadvertence will not result in personal liability, the physician may unwittingly 
  be facilitating the perpetration of fraud on Medicare by suppliers or providers. 
  Accordingly, we urge all physicians to review and familiarize themselves with 
  the information in this Fraud Alert. <strong>If a physician has any questions 
  as to the application of these requirements to specific facts, the physician 
  should contact the appropriate Medicare Fiscal Intermediary or Carrier.</strong>

<strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION FOR MEDICARE </strong> 
<p>The Medicare program only pays for health care services that are medically 
  necessary. In determining what services are medically necessary, Medicare primarily 
  relies on the professional judgment of the beneficiary's treating physician, 
  since he or she knows the patient's history and makes critical decisions, such 
  as admitting the patient to the hospital; ordering tests, drugs, and treatments; 
  and determining the length of treatment. In other words, the physician has a 
  key role in determining both the medical need for, and utilization of, many 
  health care services, including those furnished and billed by other providers 
  and suppliers. 
<p>Congress has conditioned payment for many Medicare items and services on a 
  certification signed by a physician attesting that the item or service is medically 
  necessary. For example, physicians are routinely required to certify to the 
  medical necessity for any service for which they submit bills to the Medicare 
  program. 
<p>Physicians also are involved in attesting to medical necessity when ordering 
  services or supplies that must be billed and provided by an independent supplier 
  or provider. Medicare requires physicians to certify to the medical necessity 
  for many of these items and services through prescriptions, orders, or, in certain 
  specific circumstances, Certificates of Medical Necessity (CMNs). These documentation 
  requirements substantiate that the physician has reviewed the patient's condition 
  and has determined that services or supplies are medically necessary. 
<p>Two areas where the documentation of medical necessity by physician certification 
  plays a key role are (i) home health services and (ii) durable medical equipment 
  (DME). Through various OIG audits, we have discovered that physicians sometimes 
  fail to discharge their responsibility to assess their patients' conditions 
  and need for home health care. Similarly, the OIG has found numerous examples 
  of physicians who have ordered DME or signed CMNs for DME without reviewing 
  the medical necessity for the item or even knowing the patient. 
<p>
<strong>
<hr size="1">
PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION FOR HOME HEALTH SERVICES</strong> 
<p>Medicare will pay a Medicare-certified home health agency for home health care 
  provided under a physician's plan of care to a patient confined to the home. 
  Covered services may include skilled nursing services, home health aide services, 
  physical and occupational therapy and speech language pathology, medical social 
  services, medical supplies (other than drugs and biologicals), and DME. 
<p>As a condition for payment, Medicare requires a patient's treating physician 
  to certify initially and recertify at least every 62 days (2 months) that: 
<ul>
  <li>the patient is confined to the home;</li>
  <li>the individual needs or needed (i) intermittent skilled nursing care; (ii) 
    speech or physical therapy or speech-language pathology services; or (iii) 
    occupational therapy or a continued need for occupational therapy (payment 
    for occupational therapy will be made only upon an initial certification that 
    includes care under (i) or (ii) or a recertification where the initial certification 
    included care under (i) or (ii));</li>
  <li>a plan of care has been established and periodically reviewed by the physician; 
    and</li>
  <li>the services are (were) furnished while the patient is (was) under the care 
    of a physician. </li>
</ul>
<p>The physician must order the home health services, either orally or in writing, 
  prior to the services being furnished. The physician certification must be obtained 
  at the time the plan of treatment is established or as soon thereafter as possible. 
  The physician certification must be signed and dated prior to the submission 
  of the claim to Medicare. If a physician has any questions as to the application 
  of these requirements to specific facts, the physician should contact the appropriate 
  Medicare Fiscal Intermediary or Carrier. <br>

<hr size="1">
<strong>PHYSICIAN ORDERS AND CERTIFICATES OF MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR DURABLE MEDICAL 
EQUIPMENT, PROSTHETICS, ORTHOTICS, AND SUPPLIES FOR HOME USE</strong> 
<p>DME is equipment that can withstand repeated use, is primarily used for a medical 
  purpose, and is not generally used in the absence of illness or injury. Examples 
  include hospital beds, wheelchairs, and oxygen delivery systems. Medicare will 
  cover medical supplies that are necessary for the effective use of DME, as well 
  as surgical dressings, catheters, and ostomy bags. However, Medicare will only 
  cover DME and supplies that have been ordered or prescribed by a physician. 
  The order or prescription must be personally signed and dated by the patient's 
  treating physician. 
<p>DME suppliers that submit bills to Medicare are required to maintain the physician's 
  original written order or prescription in their files. The order or prescription 
  must include: 
<p>o the beneficiary's name and full address; 
<p>o the physician's signature; 
<p>o the date the physician signed the prescription or order; 
<p>o a description of the items needed; 
<p>o the start date of the order (if appropriate); and 
<p>o the diagnosis (if required by Medicare program policies) and a realistic 
  estimate of the total length of time the equipment will be needed (in months 
  or years). 
<p>For certain items or supplies, including supplies provided on a periodic basis 
  and drugs, additional information may be required. For supplies provided on 
  a periodic basis, appropriate information on the quantity used, the frequency 
  of change, and the duration of need should be included. If drugs are included 
  in the order, the dosage, frequency of administration, and, if applicable, the 
  duration of infusion and concentration should be included. 
<p>Medicare further requires claims for payment for certain kinds of DME to be 
  accompanied by a CMN signed by a treating physician (unless the DME is prescribed 
  as part of a plan of care for home health services). When a CMN is required, 
  the provider or supplier must keep the CMN containing the treating physician's 
  original signature and date on file. 
<p>Generally, a CMN has four sections: 
<ul>
  <li>Section A contains general information on the patient, supplier, and physician. 
    <strong>Section A may be completed by the supplier.</strong></li>
  <li>Section B contains the medical necessity justification for DME. This cannot 
    be filled out by the supplier. <strong>Section B must be completed by the 
    physician, a non-physician clinician involved in the care of the patient, 
    or a physician employee.</strong> If the physician did not personally complete 
    section B, the name of the person who did complete section B and his or her 
    title and employer must be specified.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Section C contains a description of the equipment and its cost. <strong>Section 
    C is completed by the supplier. </strong></li>
  <li>Section D is the treating physician's attestation and signature, which certifies 
    that the physician has reviewed sections A, B, and C of the CMN and that the 
    information in section B is true, accurate, and complete. <strong>Section 
    D must be signed by the treating physician.</strong>Signature stamps and date 
    stamps are not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>By signing the CMN, the physician represents that: 
<p>o he or she is the patient's treating physician and the information regarding 
  the physician's address and unique physician identification number (UPIN) is 
  correct; <br>
  <br>
<p>o the entire CMN, including the sections filled out by the supplier, was completed 
  <strong>prior</strong> to the physician's signature; and 
<p>o the information in section B relating to medical necessity is true, accurate, 
  and complete to the best of the physician's knowledge. 
<p>
<strong>
<hr size="1">
IMPROPER PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATIONS</strong> <strong>FOSTER FRAUD</strong> 
<p>Unscrupulous suppliers and providers may steer physicians into signing or authorizing 
  improper certifications of medical necessity. In some instances, the certification 
  forms or statements are completed by DME suppliers or home health agencies and 
  presented to the physician, who then signs the forms without verifying the actual 
  need for the items or services. In many cases, the physician may obtain no personal 
  benefit when signing these unverified orders and is only accommodating the supplier 
  or provider. While a physician's signature on a false or misleading certification 
  made through mistake, simple negligence, or inadvertence will not result in 
  personal liability, the physician may unwittingly be facilitating the perpetration 
  of fraud on Medicare by suppliers or providers. When the physician knows the 
  information is false or acts with reckless disregard as to the truth of the 
  statement, such physician risks criminal, civil, and administrative penalties. 
<p>Sometimes, a physician may receive compensation in exchange for his or her 
  signature. Compensation can take the form of cash payments, free goods, or any 
  other thing of value. Such cases may trigger additional criminal and civil penalties 
  under the anti-kickback statute. 
<p>The following are examples of inappropriate certifications uncovered by the 
  OIG in the course of its investigations of fraud in the provision of home health 
  services and medical equipment and supplies: 
<ul>
  <li>A physician knowingly signs a number of forms provided by a home health 
    agency that falsely represent that skilled nursing services are medically 
    necessary in order to qualify the patient for home health services.</li>
  <li>A physician certifies that a patient is confined to the home and qualifies 
    for home health services, even though the patient tells the physician that 
    her only restrictions are due to arthritis in her hands, and she has no restrictions 
    on her routine activities, such as grocery shopping.</li>
  <li>At the prompting of a DME supplier, a physician signs a stack of blank CMNs 
    for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS) units. The CMNs are 
    later completed with false information in support of fraudulent claims for 
    the equipment. The false information purports to show that the physician ordered 
    and certified to the medical necessity for the TENS units for which the supplier 
    has submitted claims.</li>
  <li>A physician signs CMNs for respiratory medical equipment falsely representing 
    that the equipment was medically necessary. </li>
  <li>A physician signs CMNs for wheelchairs and hospital beds without seeing 
    the patients, then falsifies his medical charts to indicate that he treated 
    them.</li>
  <li>A physician accepts anywhere from $50 to $400 from a DME supplier for each 
    prescription he signs for oxygen concentrators and nebulizers. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<hr size="1">
<strong>POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS</strong> 
<p>A physician is not personally liable for erroneous claims due to mistakes, 
  inadvertence, or simple negligence. However, knowingly signing a false or misleading 
  certification or signing with reckless disregard for the truth can lead to serious 
  criminal, civil, and administrative penalties including: 
<ul>
  <li>criminal prosecution;</li>
  <li>fines as high as $10,000 per false claim plus treble damages; or</li>
  <br>
  <br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>administrative sanctions including: exclusion from participation in Federal 
    health care programs, withholding or recovery of payments, and loss of license 
    or disciplinary actions by state regulatory agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physicians may violate these laws when, for example: 
<ul>
  <li>they sign a certification as a "courtesy" to a patient, service provider, 
    or DME supplier when they have not first made a determination of medical necessity;</li>
  <li>they knowingly or recklessly sign a false or misleading certification that 
    causes a false claim to be submitted to a Federal health care program; or</li>
  <li>they receive any financial benefit for signing the certification (including 
    free or reduced rent, patient referrals, supplies, equipment, or free labor).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if they do not receive any financial or other benefit from providers or 
  suppliers, physicians may be liable for making false or misleading certifications.
