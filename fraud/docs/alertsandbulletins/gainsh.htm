<p>July 1999 </p>
<p><strong>A. Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) was established at the Department of 
  Health and Human Services by Congress in 1976 to identify and eliminate fraud, 
  abuse and waste in the Department's programs and to promote efficiency and economy 
  in departmental operations. &nbsp; The OIG carries out this mission through 
  a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. </p>
<p>The Fraud and Abuse Control Program, established by the Health Insurance Portability 
  and Accountability Act of 1996, authorized the OIG to provide guidance to the 
  health care industry to prevent fraud and abuse, and to promote the highest 
  level of ethical and lawful conduct.&nbsp; To further these goals, the OIG issues 
  Special Advisory Bulletins about industry practices or arrangements that potentially 
  implicate the fraud and abuse authorities subject to enforcement by the OIG. 
</p>
<p>This Special Advisory Bulletin addresses the application of sections 1128A(b)(1) 
  and (2) of the Social Security Act (the Act) to gainsharing arrangements.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  The civil money penalty (CMP) set forth in section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibits 
  any hospital or critical access hospital from knowingly making a payment directly 
  or indirectly to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit services to 
  Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries under the physician's care. </p>
<p>While the OIG recognizes that appropriately structured gainsharing arrangements 
  may offer significant benefits where there is no adverse impact on the quality 
  of care received by patients, section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act clearly prohibits 
  such arrangements. &nbsp; Moreover, regulatory relief from the CMP prohibition 
  will require statutory authorization. </p>
<p>Some hospitals and physicians may have already implemented programs that involve 
  Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.&nbsp; In exercising its enforcement discretion, 
  and in the absence of any evidence that a gainsharing arrangement has violated 
  any other statutes or adversely affected patient care, the OIG will take into 
  consideration whether a gainsharing arrangement was terminated expeditiously 
  following publication of this Bulletin. </p>
<p><strong>B. Prohibition on Hospital Payments to Physicians to Induce Reduction 
  or Limitation of Services</strong> </p>
<p>Under section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act, a hospital is prohibited from making 
  a payment, directly or indirectly, to induce a physician to reduce or limit 
  services to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries under the physician's direct 
  care.&nbsp; Hospitals that make (and physicians that receive) such payments 
  are liable for CMPs of up to $2,000 per patient covered by the payments (section 
  1128A(b)(2) of the Act). </p>
<p>The statutory proscription is very broad.&nbsp; The payment need not be tied 
  to an actual diminution in care, so long as the hospital knows that the payment 
  may influence the physician to reduce or limit services to his or her patients.&nbsp; 
  There is no requirement that the prohibited payment be tied to a specific patient 
  or to a reduction in medically necessary care.&nbsp; In short, any hospital 
  incentive plan that encourages physicians through payments to reduce or limit 
  clinical services directly or indirectly violates the statute. </p>
<p>The breadth of the prohibition was intentional.&nbsp; As initially enacted 
  by Congress, section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibited payments by both hospitals 
  and Medicare managed care plans to induce physicians to reduce clinical services.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  Section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act was subsequently amended to delete the reference 
  to Medicare managed care plans, and to add a new subsection to section 1876 
  of the Act that permitted Medicare managed care plans to implement physician 
  incentive plans, provided the managed care plan did not induce the reduction 
  of <u>medically necessary</u> care to <u>individual</u> patients and did not 
  place the physician at substantial financial risk for services not provided 
  by the physician.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Further, Congress explicitly 
  gave the Secretary authority to regulate physician incentive plans offered by 
  Medicare risk managed care plans.&nbsp; Because the resulting two provisions 
  address the same issues and were drafted together, the stark difference in otherwise 
  parallel language reflects a congressional decision to prohibit any payment 
  arrangement between hospitals and physicians that is intended to induce a reduction 
  or limitation in services. </p>
<p>This reading of the statute is also consistent with the legislative history 
  surrounding the enactment of section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act.&nbsp; The prohibition 
  was prompted in part by a General Accounting Office (GAO) report for the Chairman 
  of the Subcommittee on Health of the House Ways and Means Committee regarding 
  the physician incentive plans being implemented by hospitals in response to 
  the then-recently enacted diagnostic related group prospective payment system 
  and their potential detrimental effects on quality of care for Medicare patients.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  The report analyzed four types of hospital-physician incentive plans, of which 
  at least two bear strong similarities, and contain safeguards comparable, to 
  the gainsharing arrangements currently being marketed by the healthcare consulting 
  industry.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> While the GAO report discussed several 
  features in these plans that reduced the incentive to give substandard care, 
  it concluded that no combination of features could guarantee that such plans 
  would not be subject to abuse.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> </p>
<p>Congress concurred. The House Committee Report that accompanied the House provision 
  that became section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act stated that &quot;[t]he Committee 
  believes that such incentive payments may create a conflict of interest that 
  may limit the ability of the physician to exercise independent professional 
  judgment in the best interest of his or her patients.&quot;<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
  In explaining the inclusion of the prohibition in the final budget reconciliation 
  bill that became OBRA 1986, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health of the 
  House Ways and Means Committee, who was also a member of the Conference Committee, 
  stated on the floor of the House that: </p>
<p>&quot;[T]he House held firm in its insistence on outlawing certain physician 
  incentive plans.&nbsp; We must not tolerate hospitals paying physicians to reduce 
  or limit services to the elderly.&quot;<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> </p>
<p>In sum, we believe that section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibits any hospital 
  payments that induce physicians to reduce or limit clinical services to the 
  physicians' patients. </p>
<p><strong>C. Gainsharing Arrangements</strong> </p>
<p>While there is no fixed definition of a &quot;gainsharing&quot; arrangement, 
  the term typically refers to an arrangement in which a hospital gives physicians 
  a percentage share of any reduction in the hospital's costs for patient care 
  attributable in part to the physicians' efforts.&nbsp; In most arrangements, 
  in order to receive any payment, the clinical care must not have been adversely 
  affected as measured by selected quality and performance measures.&nbsp; In 
  addition, many plans require a determination by an independent consultant that 
  the payment represents &quot;fair market value&quot; for the collective physician 
  efforts. Medicare Part B and Medicaid payments to physicians generally are unaffected 
  by a gainsharing arrangement. </p>
<p>Gainsharing arrangements seek to align physician incentives with those of hospitals 
  by offering physicians a share of the hospital's variable cost savings attributable 
  to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Since the institution of the Medicare 
  Part A DRG system of hospital reimbursement and with the growth of managed care, 
  hospitals have experienced significant financial pressures to reduce costs.&nbsp; 
  However, because physicians are paid separately under Medicare Part B and Medicaid, 
  physicians do not have the same incentive to save hospital costs.&nbsp; Gainsharing 
  arrangements are designed to bridge this gap by offering physicians a portion 
  of the hospital's cost savings in exchange for identifying and implementing 
  cost saving strategies. </p>
<p>The OIG recognizes that hospitals have a legitimate interest in enlisting physicians 
  in their efforts to eliminate unnecessary costs.&nbsp; Savings that do not affect 
  the quality of patient care may be generated in many ways, including substituting 
  lower cost but equally effective medical supplies, items or devices; re-engineering 
  hospital surgical and medical procedures; reducing utilization of medically 
  unnecessary ancillary services; and reducing unnecessary lengths of stay.&nbsp; 
  Achieving these savings may require substantial effort on the part of the participating 
  physicians.&nbsp; Obviously, a reduction in health care costs that does not 
  adversely affect the quality of the health care provided to patients is in the 
  best interest of the nation's health care system. &nbsp; Nonetheless, the plain 
  language of section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibits tying the physicians' compensation 
  for such services to reductions or limitations in items or services provided 
  to patients under the physicians' clinical care. </p>
<p><strong>D. Application of Section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act to Gainsharing Arrangements</strong> 
</p>
<p>Gainsharing arrangements that directly or indirectly provide physicians financial 
  incentives to reduce or limit items or services to patients that are under the 
  physicians' clinical care are precisely the kind of physician incentive plans 
  that Congress prohibited when it enacted section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act.&nbsp; 
  The language of the statute, the language of the companion statute on managed 
  care physician incentive plans, and the legislative history compel the conclusion 
  that section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibits any hospital-physician incentive 
  plan that compensates a physician directly or indirectly based on cost savings 
  on items and services furnished to patients under the physician's clinical care. 
  We can perceive no meaningful difference between the kinds of incentive plans 
  proposed in 1986 at the time of enactment of section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act 
  (as reflected in the GAO report) and the variants being promoted by hospitals 
  and health care consultants today. </p>
<p>Moreover, given the clear statutory prohibition on hospital-physician incentive 
  plans, the OIG cannot provide any regulatory relief absent further authorizing 
  legislation. &nbsp; Where Congress intended the Department to regulate physician 
  incentive plans, such as plans offered by risk-based Medicare managed care plans, 
  it did so explicitly. &nbsp; Congress' omission of comparable regulatory authority 
  for the Secretary over hospital-physician incentive plans represents its considered 
  judgment that such plans are flatly prohibited. </p>
<p>We note, however, that hospitals may align incentives with physicians to achieve 
  cost savings through means that do not violate section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act.&nbsp; 
  For example, hospitals and physicians may enter into personal services contracts 
  where hospitals pay physicians based on a fixed fee that is fair market value 
  for services rendered, rather than a percentage of cost savings. Such contracts 
  must meet the requirements of the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of 
  the Act). </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the statutory prohibition, the OIG has given extensive consideration 
  to whether it would be appropriate to protect individual gainsharing arrangements 
  from OIG administrative sanctions through the issuance of favorable advisory 
  opinions.&nbsp; Based on our review of a number of requests, we have concluded 
  that they contain common elements that preclude our issuance of any favorable 
  opinion.&nbsp; First, to date, the OIG has exercised its discretion to protect 
  various arrangements from sanction only where such arrangements pose a minimal 
  risk of fraud or abuse. By contrast, gainsharing arrangements pose a high risk 
  of abuse.&nbsp; In order to retain or attract high-referring physicians, hospitals 
  will be under pressure from competitors and physicians to increase the percentage 
  of savings shared with the physicians, manipulate the hospital accounts to generate 
  phantom savings, or otherwise game the arrangement to generate income for referring 
  physicians.&nbsp; Given these pressures and the potential adverse impact on 
  patient care from gainsharing arrangements, the OIG believes that immunizing 
  such arrangements from sanction would be imprudent and inappropriate. </p>
<p>Second, gainsharing arrangements will require ongoing oversight both as to 
  quality of care and fraud that is not available through the advisory opinion 
  process.&nbsp; Apart from the potential for fraud and abuse, a critical inquiry 
  is whether the arrangements have adequate and accurate measures of quality of 
  care that would provide assurance that there is no adverse impact on patient 
  care.&nbsp; Based on discussions with experts both within and without the Federal 
  Government, the OIG has determined that any performance measures would require 
  extensive verification through audits or review by an independent party on a 
  continuing basis.&nbsp; The Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, which 
  issues advisory opinions, has neither the resources nor the expertise to police 
  a multitude of such arrangements on an ongoing basis. </p>
<p>Third, case by case determinations by advisory opinions are an inadequate and 
  inequitable substitute for comprehensive and uniform regulation in this area.&nbsp; 
  Were the OIG to issue a favorable opinion to one provider, that provider would 
  have a significant competitive advantage in recruiting and attracting physicians 
  to admit patients to its facility, since the physicians would have the opportunity 
  to earn significant additional income not available at other institutions.&nbsp; 
  The consequences would be that every hospital in the country would request an 
  advisory opinion for its own program, and many would implement their own programs 
  in the hope that their programs were close enough.&nbsp; Given the potentially 
  serious adverse effects on patient care from improperly designed or implemented 
  gainsharing arrangements, regulation of gainsharing arrangements requires clear, 
  uniform, enforceable and independently verifiable standards applicable to all 
  affected providers and not case by case decision-making. </p>
<p><strong>E. Application to Other Arrangements</strong> </p>
<p>We are aware of reports that hospitals and physicians are engaging in a number 
  of clinical joint ventures, including both freestanding specialty hospitals 
  (e.g., heart, orthopedic, or maternity hospitals), and arrangements in which 
  a high revenue generating unit or service (e.g., cardiology or cardiac surgery) 
  of an existing hospital is restructured and legally incorporated as a separate 
  hospital. </p>
<p>Typically marketed only to physicians in a position to refer patients to the 
  venture and structured to take advantage of the exception in the physician self-referral 
  law for physician investments in &quot;whole hospitals&quot;, these ventures 
  may induce investor-physicians to reduce services to patients through participation 
  in profits generated by cost savings in clinical care.&nbsp; Accordingly, we 
  believe such arrangements may also violate section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act, in 
  at least some circumstances.&nbsp; In addition, such arrangements may implicate 
  the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act). </p>
<p><strong>F. Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>Absent legislative relief, section 1128A(b)(1) of the Act prohibits any gainsharing 
  arrangements that involve payments by or on behalf of a hospital to physicians 
  with clinical care responsibilities, directly or indirectly, to induce a reduction 
  or limitation of services to Medicare or Medicaid patients.&nbsp; Parties interested 
  in pursuing gainsharing arrangements that are currently prohibited by section 
  1128A(b)(1) of the Act should seek legislative relief. In the light of reports 
  that some hospitals may already have such arrangements in place, the OIG will, 
  in the absence of any evidence that an arrangement has violated any other statutes 
  or adversely affected patient care, take into consideration in exercising its 
  enforcement discretion whether a gainsharing arrangement was terminated expeditiously 
  following publication of this Bulletin in the <u>Federal Register</u>. </p>
