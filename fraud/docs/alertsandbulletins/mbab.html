  Need to know About<br>
  Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO)<br>
  Arrangements:<br>
  Know Your Rights </h3>
<p>This Advisory Bulletin provides important information about HMO obligations 
  and beneficiary rights: 
<ul>
  <li>regarding enrollment in an HMO;</li>
  <li>the provision of services by HMOs to beneficiaries; and,</li>
  <li>disenrollment from an HMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also provides information about how beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs can seek 
  help, and where they can file complaints if they believe that their rights have 
  been violated or an HMO has acted inappropriately. This Advisory Bulletin should 
  be helpful to Medicare beneficiaries who are thinking about joining an HMO as 
  well as those who are already enrolled. </p>
<p>The Advisory Bulletin provides information on what beneficiaries need to do 
  if they believe their HMO is not meeting its obligations or may be violating 
  their rights. This includes: 
<ul>
  <li>Complain directly to the HMO;</li>
  <li>Contact the local or State Insurance Counselling and Assistance Program. 
    (Toll-free Hot Line numbers listed)</li>
  <li>Contact the HHS Office of Inspector General through its toll-free Hot Line 
    or the HCFA Medicare toll-free Hot Line number</li>
</ul>
