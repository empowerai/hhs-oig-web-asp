<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Notice of Proposed Special Advisory Bulletin. </p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> This <u>Federal Register</u> notice seeks the input 
  and comments of interested parties on </p>
<p>a Special Advisory Bulletin being developed by the OIG and HCFA designed to 
  address requirements of the patient anti-dumping statute and the obligations 
  of hospitals to screen all patients seeking emergency services and provide stabilizing 
  medical treatment to enrollees of managed care plans if their condition warrants 
  it. In developing this proposed issuance and soliciting public comment, it is 
  our goal to provide clear and meaningful advice with regard to the application 
  of the anti-dumping provisions, and ensure greater public awareness of the hospitals' 
  obligations in providing emergency medical services to those individuals insured 
  by managed care plans. </p>
<p><strong>DATES:</strong> To assure consideration, comments must be delivered 
  to the address provided below by </p>
<p>no later than 5 p.m. on [30 days after publication in the <u>Federal Register</u>.] 
</p>
<p><strong>ADDRESSES: </strong>Please mail or deliver your written comments and 
  recommendations to the </p>
<p>following address: </p>
<p>Office of Inspector General </p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services </p>
<p>Attention: OIG-33-SFA </p>

  Friday of each week from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. </p>
<p><strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> </p>
<p>Joel Schaer, Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, (202) 619-0089 </p>
<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> </p>
<p>In an effort to identify and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in the Department's 
  health care programs, the OIG periodically develops and issues Special Fraud 
  Alerts and, with the cooperation of HCFA, Advisory Bulletins to alert health 
  care providers and program beneficiaries about potential problems. This proposed 
  bulletin is being developed by the OIG and HCFA to address the principal requirements 
  of the patient anti-dumping statute (section 1867 of the Social Security Act) 
  and to discuss how the requirements of that statutory provision apply to individuals 
  insured by managed care plans that require &quot;prior authorization&quot; for 
  emergency services. We have attempted to conform this proposed bulletin with 
  policies set forth in the HCFA State Operations Manual on Provider Certification 
  (Transmittal No. 2, May 1998) which provides guidelines and investigative procedures 
  for reviewing the responsibilities of Medicare participating hospitals. </p>
<p>Section 1867 of the Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating 
  hospitals that offer emergency services with respect to individuals coming to 
  the hospital and seeking treatment of possible emergency medical conditions. 
  Specifically, the draft Special Advisory Bulletin proposes to address: (1) the 
  obligations of these hospitals in providing screening to all patients seeking 
  emergency services and stabilizing emergency treatment to individuals seeking 
  such care; (2) the special concerns in the provision of emergency services to 
  enrollees of managed care plans; (3) the rules governing Medicare and Medicaid 
  managed care plans with respect to prior authorization requirements and payment 
  for emergency services; and (4) what types of practices will serve to promote 
  compliance by hospitals with the patient anti-dumping statute when managed care 
  enrollees seek emergency services. We would appreciate receiving specific comments, 
  recommendations and suggestions on the issues discussed in this proposed bulletin. 
</p>
<p>Set forth below for comment is the proposed OIG/HCFA Special Advisory Bulletin 
  addressing the patient dumping statute. </p>
<p>OBLIGATIONS OF HOSPITALS TO RENDER EMERGENCY CARE TO </p>
<p>ENROLLEES OF MANAGED CARE PLANS </p>
<p><strong>What are the Obligations of Medicare-Participating Hospitals That Offer 
  Emergency Services to Individuals Seeking Such Services? </strong> 
<ul>
  <li>The anti-dumping statute (section 1867 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 
    1395dd) sets forth the Federally-mandated responsibilities of Medicare-participating 
    hospitals to individuals with potential emergency medical conditions. </li>
  <li>Under the anti-dumping statute, a hospital must provide to any person who 
    comes seeking emergency services an <strong>appropriate medical screening 
    examination</strong> sufficient to determine whether he or she has an <strong>emergency 
    medical condition</strong>, as defined by statute. When appropriate, ancillary 
    services routinely available at the hospital must be provided as part of the 
    medical screening examination. </li>
  <li>If the person is determined to have an emergency medical condition, the 
    hospital is required to <strong>stabilize</strong> the medical condition of 
    the individual, within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, 
    prior to discharge or transfer. </li>
  <li>If the patient's medical condition cannot be stabilized before a transfer 
    requested by the patient (or determined to be in the patient's best interest 
    by the responsible medical personnel), the hospital is required to follow 
    very specific statutory requirements designed to facilitate a <strong>safe 
    transfer</strong> to another facility. </li>
  <li>A hospital <strong>may not delay</strong> the provision of an appropriate 
    medical screening examination or further medical examination and stabilizing 
    medical treatment in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment 
    or insurance status. </li>
  <li>Regulations implementing these statutory obligations are found at 42 CFR 
    part 489. The anti-dumping statute is enforced jointly by the Health Care 
    Financing Administration (HCFA) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
    of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). </li>
  <li>Sanctions that may be imposed by HHS for violations of the anti-dumping 
    statute include the termination of the hospital's provider agreement, and 
    the imposition of civil money penalties against both the hospital and the 
    physician responsible for examination, treatment, or transfer of an individual. 
    In addition, the anti-dumping statute provides for the exclusion of such physician 
    if the violation is gross and flagrant or repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is there a Special Concern about the Provision of Emergency Services 
  to Enrollees of Managed Care Plans?</strong> </p>
<p>Many managed care plans require their members to seek prior authorization for 
  some medical services, including emergency services. As noted above, the anti-dumping 
  statute prohibits a hospital's inquiry about a patient's method of payment or 
  insurance status, or use of such information, from delaying a screening examination 
  or stabilizing medical treatment. It has come to our attention that some hospitals 
  routinely seek prior authorization from a patient's primary care physician or 
  from the plan when a managed care patient requests emergency services, since 
  the failure to obtain authorization may result in the plan refusing to pay for 
  the emergency services. In such circumstances, the patient may be personally 
  liable for the costs. </p>
<p>A reasonable argument can be made that patients (other than those arriving 
  in dire condition) should be informed when they request emergency services of 
  their potential financial liability for services. Some would go further and 
  argue that the hospital itself should seek prior approval from the patient's 
  health plan for emergency services to preserve the patient's right to seek coverage 
  for such services. However, our concern is that, such an inquiry may improperly 
  or unduly influence patients to leave the hospital without receiving an appropriate 
  medical screening examination. This result would be inconsistent with the goals 
  of the anti-dumping statute and could leave the hospital exposed to liability 
  under the statute. </p>
<p>Investigations of allegations of the anti-dumping statute violations across 
  the country have persuaded the OIG and HCFA that managed care patients may be 
  at risk of being discharged or transferred without receiving a medical screening 
  examination, largely because of the problems inherent in seeking &quot;prior 
  authorization.&quot; Hospitals sometimes are caught between the legal obligations 
  imposed under the anti-dumping statute and the terms of agreements which they 
  have with managed care plans. For example, some Medicaid managed care contractors, 
  as a condition of contracting with hospitals to provide services to their enrollees, 
  have attempted to require such hospitals to obtain prior authorization from 
  the plan before screening or treating an enrollee in order to be eligible for 
  reimbursement for services provided. </p>
<p>The OIG's and HCFA's view of the legal requirements of the anti-dumping statute 
  in this situation is as follows. Notwithstanding the terms of any managed care 
  agreements between plans and hospitals, the anti-dumping statute continues to 
  govern the obligations of hospitals to screen and provide stabilizing medical 
  treatment to individuals who come to the hospital seeking emergency services 
  regardless of the individual's ability to pay. While managed care plans have 
  a financial interest in controlling the kinds of services for which they will 
  pay, and while they may have a legitimate interest in deterring their enrollees 
  from over-utilizing emergency services, no contract between a hospital and a 
  managed care plan can excuse the hospital from its anti-dumping statute obligations. 
  Once a managed care enrollee comes to a hospital that offers emergency services, 
  the hospital must provide the services required under the anti-dumping statute 
  without regard for the patient's insurance status or any prior authorization 
  requirement of such insurance.<a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p>
<p><strong>What About Arrangements Between Hospitals and Managed Care Plans for 
  &quot;Dual Staffing&quot; of Emergency Departments?</strong> </p>
<p>Some managed care organizations (MCOs) and hospitals have entered into, or 
  are considering entering into, arrangements whereby the hospital permits the 
  MCO to station its own physicians in the hospital's emergency department, separate 
  from the hospital's own emergency physician staff, for the purpose of screening 
  and treating MCO patients who request emergency services. This kind of arrangement 
  is known as &quot;dual staffing.&quot; In a dual staffing setting, two separate 
  groups of physicians would be providing emergency care, perhaps using different 
  policies and protocols, performing different procedures, using different referral 
  practices and drug formularies, relying on different on-call physicians, and 
  having different credentials. </p>
<p>It is believed by some that dual staffing in emergency departments can facilitate 
  the expeditious provision of services to MCO patients by physicians and other 
  practitioners in their own health plans, particularly when patients present 
  in emergency departments in stable condition. However, some hospitals and emergency 
  physicians have raised questions about how the requirements of the patient anti-dumping 
  statute may affect dual staffing arrangements, and we have been considering 
  how to respond. As interpreted by this Department, the statute requires that 
  a hospital and its physicians provide medically adequate screening and stabilization, 
  supported by professionally recognized standards of care, to individuals seeking 
  emergency services. Theoretically, one could construct two equally good emergency 
  service &quot;tracks,&quot; each adequately staffed and each with equally good 
  access to all of the medical capabilities of the hospital, such that both MCO 
  and non-MCO patients received equal access to screening and stabilizing medical 
  treatment. This arrangement would seem to satisfy the requirements of the anti-dumping 
  statute. </p>
<p>Absent such equivalency, implementation of dual staffing raises some concerns 
  under the patient anti-dumping statute. For example, what if either the MCO 
  or non-MCO track is understaffed or simply overcrowded, and a patient in a particular 
  track is subjected to a significant delay in screening and stabilizing treatment, 
  even though a physician in the alternative track was available to see the individual? 
  What if the protocols, referral patterns, use of specialists and patient guidelines 
  are substantially different between the MCO and non-MCO tracks such that two 
  different standards of care are provided in performing screenings or stabilizing 
  treatment? How can a hospital be sure that all patients requesting emergency 
  services receive, as required by statute, an appropriate screening examination 
  within the full capabilities of the hospital, and necessary stabilizing treatment 
  within the capability of the staff and facilities of the hospital, if the MCO 
  track operates independently from the hospital's own emergency care system? 
  These are difficult questions, and we have not yet determined how to treat issues 
  related to dual staffing under the patient anti-dumping act. As a result, we 
  are specifically soliciting comments and suggestions from the public on this 
  issue, and we expect to offer some specific guidance in this area in the final 
  version of this Special Advisory Bulletin. </p>
<p><strong>What are the Rules Governing Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care Plans 
  with Respect to Prior Authorization Requirements and Payment for Emergency Services?</strong> 
</p>
<p>There are special requirements for managed care plans that contract with Medicare 
  and Medicaid to provide services to beneficiaries of those programs. Congress 
  has specified that Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans may not require 
  prior authorization for emergency services, and must pay for such services, 
  without regard to whether the hospital providing such services has a contractual 
  relationship with the plan. Under statutory amendments recently enacted in the 
  Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Pub.L. 105-33)<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans are 
  prohibited from requiring prior authorization for emergency services, including 
  those that &quot;are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition.&quot; 
  Moreover, Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans are required to pay for emergency 
  services provided to their enrollees. The obligation to pay for emergency services 
  is based on a &quot;prudent layperson&quot; standard, which means that the need 
  for emergency services should be determined from a reasonable patient's perspective 
  at the time of presentation of the symptoms.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p><strong>What Practices Will Promote Compliance with the Anti-Dumping Statute 
  by Hospitals When Managed Care Enrollees Seek Emergency Services?</strong> </p>
<p>The OIG and HCFA are concerned that discussion by hospital personnel with a 
  patient regarding the possible need for prior authorization, or his or her potential 
  financial liability for medical services provided by a hospital that offers 
  emergency services, could influence patients to leave the emergency department 
  without receiving an appropriate medical screening examination. Without also 
  informing the patient of his or her rights to a medical screening examination 
  and to stabilizing medical treatment if the patient's condition warrants it, 
  a discussion about insurance, ability to pay and seeking prior authorization 
  may impede a hospital's compliance with its obligation under the anti-dumping 
  statute. Discussions between a hospital staff member and a patient regarding 
  potential prior authorization requirements and their financial consequences 
  that have the effect of delaying a medical screening are violations of the anti-dumping 
  statute. Moreover, the OIG and HCFA believe that in the absence of an initial 
  screening, the decision of a managed care plan regarding the need for treatment 
  is likely to be ill-informed. Patients are entitled to receive a medical screening 
  examination and stabilizing medical treatment under the anti-dumping statute 
  regardless of a hospital's contract with a health plan that requires prior authorization. 
  Accordingly, the OIG and HCFA suggest the following practices to minimize the 
  likelihood that a hospital will violate the statute: 
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>No Prior Authorization Before Screening or Stabilization.</u></strong> 
    It is not appropriate for a hospital to request or a health plan to require 
    prior authorization before the patient has received a medical screening examination 
    to determine the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition or 
    before the patient's emergency medical condition is stabilized.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
  </li>
  <li><strong><u>No Financial Responsibility or Advanced Beneficiary Notification 
    Forms.</u></strong> Prior to performing an appropriate medical screening examination, 
    the hospital should not ask a patient to complete a <strong>financial responsibility 
    form </strong>or an advanced beneficiary notification form, and should not 
    ask the patient to provide a co-payment for any services rendered. Such a 
    practice could deter the patient from remaining at the hospital to receive 
    care to which he or she is entitled and which the hospital is obligated to 
    provide regardless of ability to pay, and could cause unnecessary delay. </li>
  <li><strong><u>Qualified Medical Personnel Must Perform Medical Screening Examination.</u></strong> 
    A hospital should ensure that either a physician or other qualified medical 
    personnel (i.e., hospital staff approved by the hospital's governing body 
    to perform certain medical functions) provides an appropriate medical screening 
    examination to <strong>all</strong> individuals seeking emergency services. 
    Depending upon the individual's presenting symptoms, this screening examination 
    may range from a relatively simple examination to a complex one which requires 
    substantial use of ancillary services available at the hospital and on-call 
    physicians. </li>
  <li><strong><u>When a Patient Inquires About Financial Liability for Emergency 
    Services.</u></strong> If a patient inquires about his or her obligation to 
    pay for emergency services, such an inquiry should be answered by a staff 
    member who has been well trained to provide information regarding potential 
    financial liability. This staff member also should be knowledgeable about 
    the hospital's anti-dumping statute obligations and must clearly inform the 
    patient that, notwithstanding the patient's ability to pay, the hospital stands 
    ready and willing to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing 
    treatment, if necessary. Hospital staff should encourage any patient who believes 
    that he or she may have an emergency medical condition to remain for the medical 
    screening examination and to defer further discussion of financial responsibility 
    issues until <strong>after</strong> the medical screening has been performed. 
    If the patient chooses to withdraw his or her request for examination or treatment, 
    a staff member with appropriate medical training must discuss the medical 
    issues related to a &quot;voluntary withdrawal.&quot; </li>
  <li><strong><u>Voluntary Withdrawal.</u></strong> If an individual chooses to 
    withdraw his or her request for examination or treatment at the presenting 
    hospital, a hospital must perform the following: (1) offer the individual 
    further medical examination and treatment within the staff and facilities 
    available at the hospital as may be required to identify and stabilize an 
    emergency medical condition; (2) inform the individual of the risks and benefits 
    of such examination and treatment, and of the risks and benefits of withdrawal 
    prior to receiving such examination and treatment; and (3) take all reasonable 
    steps to secure the individual's written informed consent to refuse such examination 
    and treatment. The medical record should contain a description of the examination, 
    treatment, or both, if applicable, that was refused.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that an individual, e.g., nurse, doctor, other emergency room 
  staff member or patient, believes that a hospital may have violated the anti-dumping 
  statute, that individual should report the alleged violation to the HCFA office 
  in the region in which the hospital is located. <br wp="br1">

<p>FOOTNOTES: <a name="N_1_"></a></p>
<p>1. Separate and apart from the anti-dumping statute, in accordance with sections 
  1857(g), 1876(i)(6), 1903(m)(5) and 1932(e) of the Social Security Act, the 
  OIG (acting on behalf of the Secretary) has the authority to impose intermediate 
  sanctions against Medicare and Medicaid contracting managed care plans that 
  fail to provide medically necessary services, including emergency services, 
  to enrollees where the failure adversely affects (or has a substantial likelihood 
  of adversely affecting) the enrollee. Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans 
  that fail to comply with the above provision are subject to civil money penalties 
  of up to $25,000 for each denial of medically necessary services. <a name="N_2_"></a></p>
<p>2. See section 4001 of the BBA, which created section 1852(d) of the Act. Section 
  1852(d) covers emergency services and prior authorization for Medicare enrollees. 
  Also, section 4704 (a) of the BBA created section 1932(b) of the Act, which 
  contains Medicaid provisions covering emergency services and prior authorization. 
  <a name="N_3_"></a></p>
<p>3. With respect to Medicare, prior authorization requirements were already 
  explicitly prohibited by regulations before the passage of the BBA for emergency 
  services provided outside an HMO or competitive medical plan (42 CFR 417.414(c)(1)), 
  and by implication for services provided within such a plan. Similarly, while 
  the BBA clarified and codified the &quot;prudent layperson&quot; standard, a 
  variation of this standard has always been part of the Medicare policy for managed 
  care plans. However, all of these requirements are new to Medicaid. <a name="N_4_"></a></p>
<p>4. Of course, this would not preclude an emergency physician from contacting 
  the patient's physician at any time to seek advice regarding the patient's medical 
  history and needs that may be relevant to the medical screening and treatment 
  of the patient. Further, a patient who has not already contacted his or her 
  health plan is free to do so at any time during his or her wait for emergency 
  services. </p>
