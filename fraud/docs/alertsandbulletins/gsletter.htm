<p>Re: Social Security Act sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) and hospital-physician 
  incentive plans for Medicare or Medicaid Beneficiaries enrolled in managed care 
  plans </p>
<p>Dear [Name Redacted]: </p>
<p>I am writing in response to your letter dated July 22, 1999, regarding the 
  application of the civil monetary penalty law at sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) 
  of the Social Security Act (the &quot;CMP&quot;) to hospital-physician incentive 
  plans limited to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in risk-based managed 
  care programs subject to regulation pursuant to sections 1876(i)(8), 1903(m)(2)(A)(x), 
  or 1852(j)(4) of the Social Security Act (the &quot;Act&quot;). We agree that 
  such hospital-physician incentive plans are not subject to the CMP. </p>
<p>Our view is based on the legislative history of sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2). 
  As initially enacted by Congress, sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) of the Act prohibited 
  payments by both hospitals and Medicare or Medicaid managed care plans to induce 
  physicians to reduce clinical services. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
  1986, § 9313(c) (P.L. 99-509). Sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) of the Act were 
  subsequently amended to delete the reference to Medicare or Medicaid managed 
  care plans and to add new subsections to sections 1876 and 1903 of the Act that 
  permitted Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans to implement physician incentive 
  plans, provided the managed care plans did not induce the reduction of medically 
  necessary care to individual patients and did not place the physician at substantial 
  financial risk for services not provided by the physician. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
  Act of 1990, §§ 4204(a), 4731 (P.L. 101-508) (codified at sections 1876(i)(8) 
  and 1903(m)(2)(A)(x) of the Act). </p>
<p>We think that Congress intended that physician incentive arrangements related 
  to Medicare risk-based managed care contracts and similar Medicaid contracts 
  be subject to regulation by the Secretary pursuant to sections 1876(i)(8) and 
  1903(m)(2)(A)(x) of the Act, in lieu of being subject to sections 1128A(b)(1) 
  and (2). We note that the physician incentive plan rules apply to physician 
  incentive plans by Medicare risk-based managed care plans that directly contract 
  with the Health Care Financing Administration and to physician incentive plans 
  related to subcontracting arrangements between such managed care plans and physician 
  groups or other intermediate entities. <u>See</u> 42 C.F.R. § 417.479(i); 61 
  Fed. Reg. 13430, 13439 (Mar. 27, 1996); <u>see also</u> 42 C.F.R. § 434.70 (comparable 
  regulations for physician incentive plans associated with Medicaid managed care 
  organizations). </p>
<p>We think the same result holds for physician incentive plans operated by Medicare 
  + Choice managed care plans. Congress enacted statutory language almost identical 
  to that of section 1876(i)(8) in permitting the Secretary to regulate Medicare 
  + Choice physician incentive plans. <u>See</u> Social Security Act § 1852(j)(4). 
  The Health Care Financing Administration has issued an interim final rule for 
  Medicare + Choice plans that creates a regulatory framework similar to that 
  for existing Medicare and Medicaid managed care risk-based physician incentive 
  plans. <u>See</u> 63 Fed. Reg. 34968, 35002 (June 26, 1998). </p>
<p>I hope this information is useful in clarifying the scope of sections 1128A(b)(1) 
  and (2) of the Act. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>/s/ Lewis Morris </p>
<p>Assistant Inspector General for Legal Affairs </p>
<p>Office of Counsel to the Inspector General </p>
