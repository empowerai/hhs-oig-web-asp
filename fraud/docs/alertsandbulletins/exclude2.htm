<p align="center"><big><strong>Special Advisory Bulletin Outlines Effects of Exclusion 
  from Federal Health Care Programs</strong></big></p>
<p align="left">Health care providers should determine whether potential and current 
  employees and contractors have been excluded from participation in federal health 
  care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, according to a special advisory 
  bulletin issued today by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office 
  of Inspector General. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The effect of an Office of Inspector General exclusion from federal health care 
  programs is that no federal health care program payments may be made for any 
  items or services furnished, directly or indirectly, by an excluded individual 
  or entity. Almost 17,000 individuals and entities have been excluded from participating 
  in federal health care programs for misconduct ranging from fraud convictions 
  to patient abuse to defaulting on health education loans. In fiscal year 1999, 
  the Office of Inspector General expects to exclude about 3,000 individuals and 
  entities. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  &quot;Exclusion is one of the most important tools we have to protect beneficiaries 
  and stem fraud and abuse in federal health care programs,&quot; Inspector General 
  June Gibbs Brown said. &quot;To ensure that Medicare, Medicaid and other federal 
  health care programs are protected, we need the cooperation of the entire health 
  care community to help make sure excluded individuals are not involved in any 
  way in the care of federal program beneficiaries.&quot; <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Office of Inspector General periodically issues special advisory bulletins 
  to provide guidance to the health care industry to prevent fraud and abuse and 
  promote high standards of ethical and lawful conduct. The new special advisory 
  bulletin -- <em>The Effect of Exclusion From Participation in Federal Health 
  Care Programs</em> -- also will be published soon as a <em>Federal Register</em> 
  notice. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the 
  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded and strengthened the Office of Inspector 
  General's exclusion authorities. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  One of the most significant changes has been the expansion of the Office of 
  Inspector General's exclusion authority beyond Department of Health and Human 
  Services' programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to all federal health care 
  programs, including those administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
  and the Department of Defense. The only federal health care program not covered 
  by the Office of Inspector General's exclusion authority is the Federal Employees 
  Health Benefits Program. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The Office of Inspector General also has the authority to impose civil money 
  penalties against excluded individuals and entities that seek reimbursement 
  from federal health care programs and health care providers that employ or enter 
  into contracts with excluded individuals to provide items or services to federal 
  program beneficiaries. In both cases, civil money penalties of $10,000 for each 
  item or service furnished by the excluded individual may be imposed, and the 
  responsible party may have to pay three times the amount claimed for each item 
  or service. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The prohibition against federal program payment for items or services furnished 
  by excluded individuals and entities extends to payment for administrative and 
  management services not directly related to patient care. In short, no federal 
  program payment may be made to cover an excluded individual's salary, expenses 
  or fringe benefits, regardless of whether they provide direct patient care. 
  The payment prohibition applies whether federal payment results from itemized 
  claims, cost reports, fee schedules or a prospective-payment system. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Health care providers that receive federal health care funding may only employ 
  an excluded individual in limited situations where the provider is able to pay 
  the individual exclusively with non-federal funding and the items and services 
  furnished by the excluded individual relate solely to non-federal program patients. 
  <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  The following examples contained in the advisory bulletin illustrate situations 
  that can expose excluded parties and their employers to civil money penalties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed by excluded nurses, technicians or other excluded individuals 
    who work for a hospital, nursing home, home health agency or physician practice, 
    where such services are related to administrative duties, preparation of surgical 
    trays or treatment plan reviews if such services are reimbursed, directly 
    or indirectly, by a federal health care program, even if the individuals do 
    not furnish direct care to federal program beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed by excluded pharmacists or other excluded individuals 
    who input prescription information for pharmacy billing or who are involved 
    in any way in filling prescriptions for drugs reimbursed, directly or indirectly, 
    by a federal health care program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Administrative services, including the processing of claims for payment, 
    performed by an excluded individual for a Medicare fiscal intermediary or 
    carrier or a Medicaid fiscal agent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed for program beneficiaries by excluded individuals who 
    sell, deliver or refill orders for medical devices or equipment reimbursed, 
    directly or indirectly, by a federal health care program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Items or equipment sold by an excluded manufacturer or supplier used to 
    care for or treat a federal program beneficiary and reimbursed, directly or 
    indirectly by a federal health care program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Office of Inspector General maintains a list of excluded individuals/entities 
  accessible on the World Wide Web at <em>www.hhs.gov/oig/cumsan/index.htm</em> 
  and urges health care providers to check the list before hiring or contracting 
  with individuals or entities. Additionally, the Office of Inspector General 
  recommends that health care providers periodically check the list to determine 
  the exclusion status of current employees and contractors. The Office of Inspector 
  General also will provide advisory opinions on specific employment or contractual 
  arrangements that may violate the law. </p>
