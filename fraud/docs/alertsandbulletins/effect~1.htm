<p>September 1999 <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>A. Introduction</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p><strong></strong>The Office of Inspector General (OIG) was established in the 
  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to identify and eliminate fraud, 
  waste, and abuse in the Department's programs and to promote efficiency and 
  economy in Departmental operations. The OIG carries out this mission through 
  a nationwide program of audits, inspections, and investigations. In addition, 
  the OIG has been given the authority to exclude from participation in Medicare, 
  Medicaid and other Federal health care programs<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  individuals and entities who have engaged in fraud or abuse, and to impose civil 
  money penalties (CMPs) for certain misconduct related to Federal health care 
  programs (sections 1128 and 1128A of the Social Security Act (the Act)). <br>
  <br>
<p>Recent statutory enactments have strengthened and expanded the OIG's authority 
  to exclude individuals and entities from the Federal health care programs. These 
  laws also expanded the OIG's authority to assess CMPs against individuals and 
  entities that violate the law. With this expanded authority, the OIG believes 
  that it is important to explain the effect of program exclusions under the current 
  statutory and regulatory provisions. <br>
  <br>
<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, Public 
  Law 
<p>104-191, authorized the OIG to provide guidance to the health care industry 
  to prevent fraud and abuse, and to promote high levels of ethical and lawful 
  conduct. To further these goals, the OIG issues Special Advisory Bulletins about 
  industry practices or arrangements that potentially implicate the fraud and 
  abuse authorities subject to enforcement by the OIG. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
<p>In order to assist all affected parties in understanding the breadth of the 
  payment prohibitions that apply to items and services provided to Federal program 
  beneficiaries,<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> this Special Advisory Bulletin 
  provides guidance to individuals and entities that have been excluded from Federal 
  health care programs, as well as to those who might employ or contract with 
  an excluded individual or entity to provide items or services reimbursed by 
  a Federal health care program. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>B. Statutory Background</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>In 1977, in the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments, Public Law 
<p>95-142, Congress first mandated the exclusion of physicians and other practitioners 
  convicted of program-related crimes from participation in Medicare and Medicaid 
  (now codified at section 1128 of the Act). This was followed in 1981 with Congressional 
  enactment of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL), Public Law 97-35, to further 
  address health care fraud and abuse (section 1128A of the Act). The CMPL authorizes 
  the Department and the OIG to impose CMPs, assessments and program exclusions 
  against individuals and entities who submit false or fraudulent, or otherwise 
  improper claims for Medicare or Medicaid payment. "Improper claims" include 
  claims submitted by an excluded individual or entity for items or services furnished 
  during a period of program exclusion. <br>
  <br>
<p>To enhance the OIG's ability to protect the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
  and beneficiaries, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection 
  Act of 1987, Public Law 100-93, expanded and revised the OIG's administrative 
  sanction authorities by, among other things, establishing certain mandatory 
  and discretionary exclusions for various types of misconduct. <br>
  <br>
<p>The enactment of HIPAA in 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, Public 
  Law 
<p>105-33, further expanded the OIG's sanction authorities. These statutes extended 
  the application and scope of the current CMP and exclusion authorities beyond 
  programs funded by the Department to all "Federal health care programs." BBA 
  also authorized a new CMP authority to be imposed against health care providers 
  or entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded individuals for 
  the provision of services or items to Federal program beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
<p>In the discussion that follows, it should be understood that the prohibitions 
  being described apply to items and services provided, directly or indirectly, 
  to Federal program beneficiaries. The ability of an excluded individual or entity 
  to render items and services to others is not affected by an OIG exclusion. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>C. Exclusion from Federal Health Care Programs</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>The effect of an OIG exclusion from Federal health care programs is that no 
  Federal health care program payment may be made for any items or services (1) 
  furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or (2) directed or prescribed 
  by an excluded physician (42 CFR 1001.1901). This payment ban applies to all 
  methods of Federal program reimbursement, whether payment results from itemized 
  claims, cost reports, fee schedules or a prospective payment system (PPS). Any 
  items and services furnished by an excluded individual or entity are not reimbursable 
  under Federal health care programs. In addition, any items and services furnished 
  at the medical direction or prescription of an excluded physician are not reimbursable 
  when the individual or entity furnishing the services either knows or should 
  know of the exclusion. This prohibition applies even when the Federal payment 
  itself is made to another provider, practitioner or supplier that is not excluded. 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>The prohibition against Federal program payment for items or services furnished 
  by excluded individuals or entities also extends to payment for administrative 
  and management services not directly related to patient care, but that are a 
  necessary component of providing items and services to Federal program beneficiaries. 
  This prohibition continues to apply to an individual even if he or she changes 
  from one health care profession to another while excluded.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
  In addition, no Federal program payment may be made to cover an excluded individual's 
  salary, expenses or fringe benefits, regardless of whether they provide direct 
  patient care. <br>
  <br>
<p>Set forth below is a listing of some of the types of items or services that 
  are reimbursed by Federal health care programs which, when provided by excluded 
  parties, violate an OIG exclusion. These examples also demonstrate the kinds 
  of items and services that excluded parties may be furnishing which will subject 
  their employer or contractor to possible CMP liability. <br>
  <br>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed by excluded nurses, technicians or other excluded individuals 
    who work for a hospital, nursing home, home health agency or physician practice, 
    where such services are related to administrative duties, preparation of surgical 
    trays or review of treatment plans if such services are reimbursed directly 
    or indirectly (such as through a PPS or a bundled payment) by a Federal health 
    care program, even if the individuals do not furnish direct care to Federal 
    program beneficiaries;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Services performed by excluded pharmacists or other excluded individuals 
    who input prescription information for pharmacy billing or who are involved 
    in any</li>
</ul>
<p> way in filling prescriptions for drugs reimbursed, directly or indirectly, 
  by any Federal health care program; <br>
  <br>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed by excluded ambulance drivers, dispatchers and other 
    employees involved in providing transportation reimbursed by a Federal health 
    care program, to hospital patients or nursing home residents;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Services performed for program beneficiaries by excluded individuals who 
    sell, deliver or refill orders for medical devices or equipment being reimbursed 
    by a Federal health care program;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Services performed by excluded social workers who are employed by health 
    care entities to provide services to Federal program beneficiaries, and whose 
    services are reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by a Federal health care 
    program;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Administrative services, including the processing of claims for payment, 
    performed for a Medicare intermediary or carrier, or a Medicaid fiscal agent, 
    by an excluded individual;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Services performed by an excluded administrator, billing agent, accountant, 
    claims processor or utilization reviewer that are related to and reimbursed, 
    directly or indirectly, by a Federal health care program;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Items or services provided to a program beneficiary by an excluded individual 
    who works for an entity that has a contractual agreement with, and is paid 
    by, a Federal health care program; and</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Items or equipment sold by an excluded manufacturer or supplier, used in 
    the care or treatment of beneficiaries and reimbursed, directly or indirectly, 
    by a Federal health care program.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
</ul>
<p><strong>D. Violation of an OIG Exclusion By an Excluded Individual or Entity</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>An excluded party is in violation of its exclusion if it furnishes to Federal 
  program beneficiaries items or services for which Federal health care program 
  payment is sought. An excluded individual or entity that submits a claim for 
  reimbursement to a Federal health care program, or causes such a claim to be 
  submitted, may be subject to a CMP of $10,000 for each item or service furnished 
  during the period that the person or entity was excluded (section 1128A(a)(1)(D) 
  of the Act). The individual or entity may also be subject to treble damages 
  for the amount claimed for each item or service. In addition, since reinstatement 
  into the programs is not automatic, the excluded individual may jeopardize future 
  reinstatement into Federal health care programs (42 CFR 1001.3002). <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>E. </strong> <strong> Employing an Excluded Individual or Entity</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>As indicated above, BBA authorizes the imposition of CMPs against health care 
  providers and entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded individuals 
  or entities to provide items or services to Federal program beneficiaries (section 
  1128A(a)(6) of the Act; 42 CFR 1003.102(a)(2)). This authority parallels the 
  CMP for health maintenance organizations that employ or contract with excluded 
  individuals (section 1857(g)(1)(G) of the Act). Under the CMP authority, providers 
  such as hospitals, nursing homes, hospices and group medical practices may face 
  CMP exposure if they submit claims to a Federal health care program for health 
  care items or services provided, directly or indirectly, by excluded individuals 
  or entities. <br>
  <br>
<p>Thus, a provider or entity that receives Federal health care funding may only 
  employ an excluded individual in limited situations. Those situations would 
  include instances where the provider is both able to pay the individual exclusively 
  with private funds or from other non-federal funding sources, and where the 
  services furnished by the excluded individual relate solely to non-federal program 
  patients. <br>
  <br>
<p>In many instances, the practical effect of an OIG exclusion is to preclude 
  employment of an excluded individual in any capacity by a health care provider 
  that receives reimbursement, indirectly or directly, from any Federal health 
  care program. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>F. CMP Liability for Employing or Contracting with an Excluded Individual</strong> 
  <strong>or Entity</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>If a health care provider arranges or contracts (by employment or otherwise) 
  with an individual or entity who is excluded by the OIG from program participation 
  for the provision of items or services reimbursable under such a Federal program, 
  the provider may be subject to CMP liability if they render services reimbursed, 
  directly or indirectly, by such a program. CMPs of up to $10,000 for each item 
  or service furnished by the excluded individual or entity and listed on a claim 
  submitted for Federal program reimbursement, as well as an assessment of up 
  to three times the amount claimed and program exclusion may be imposed. For 
  liability to be imposed, the statute requires that the provider submitting the 
  claims for health care items or services furnished by an excluded individual 
  or entity "knows or should know" that the person was excluded from participation 
  in the Federal health care programs (section 1128A(a)(6) of the Act; 42 CFR 
  1003.102(a)(2)). Providers and contracting entities have an affirmative duty 
  to check the program exclusion status of individuals and entities prior to entering 
  into employment or contractual relationships, or run the risk of CMP liability 
  if they fail to do so. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>G</strong>. <strong>How to Determine If an Individual or Entity is 
  Excluded</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>In order to avoid potential CMP liability, the OIG urges health care providers 
  and entities 
<p>to check the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the OIG web site 
  (www.hhs.gov/oig) prior to hiring or contracting with individuals or entities. 
  In addition, if they have not already done so, health care providers should 
  periodically check the OIG web site for determining the participation/exclusion 
  status of current employees and contractors. The web site<strong> </strong>contains 
  OIG program exclusion information and is updated in both on-line searchable 
  and downloadable formats. This information is updated on a regular basis. The 
  OIG web site sorts the exclusion of individuals and entities by: (1) the legal 
  basis for the exclusion, (2) the types of individuals and entities that have 
  been excluded, and (3) the State where the excluded individual resided at the 
  time they were excluded or the State where the entity was doing business. In 
  addition, the entire exclusion file may be downloaded for persons who wish to 
  set up their own database. Monthly updates are posted to the downloadable information 
  on the web site. <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>H.</strong> <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>
  <br>
<p>In accordance with the expanded sanction authority provided in HIPAA and BBA, 
  and with limited exceptions<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, an exclusion 
  from Federal health care programs effectively precludes an excluded individual 
  or entity from being employed by, or under contract with, any practitioner, 
  provider or supplier to provide any items and services reimbursed by a Federal 
  health care program. This broad prohibition applies whether the Federal reimbursement 
  is based on itemized claims, cost reports, fee schedules or PPS. Furthermore, 
  it should be recognized that an exclusion remains in effect until the individual 
  or entity has been reinstated to participate in Federal health care programs 
  in accordance with the procedures set forth at 42 CFR 1001.3001 through 1001.3005. 
  Reinstatement does not occur automatically at the end of a term of exclusion, 
  but rather, an excluded party must apply for reinstatement. <br>
  <br>
<p>If you are an excluded individual or entity, or are considering hiring or contracting 
  with an excluded individual or entity, and question whether or not the employment 
  arrangement may violate the law, the OIG Advisory Opinion process is available 
  to offer formal binding guidance on whether an employment or contractual arrangement 
  may be in violation of the OIG's exclusion and CMP authorities. The process 
  and procedure for submitting an advisory opinion request can be found at 42 
  CFR 1008, or on the OIG web site at www.hhs.gov/oig. 
<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>A Federal health care program is defined as any plan 
  or program that provides health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, 
  or otherwise, which is funded directly, in whole or in part, by the United States 
  Government or a State health care program (with the exception of the Federal 
  Employees Health Benefits Program) (section 1128B(f) of the Act). The most significant 
  Federal health care programs are Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and the Veterans 
  programs.

  payment for items and services would continue to apply in the situation where
