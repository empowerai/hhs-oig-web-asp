  <strong>OIG/HCFA Special Advisory Bulletin on the Patient Anti-Dumping Statute</strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>AGENCY: </strong>Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Health Care Financing 
  Administration (HCFA), HHS. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>ACTION:</strong> Notice.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>SUMMARY:</strong> This <u>Federal Register</u> notice, developed jointly 
  by the OIG and HCFA, sets forth the Special Advisory Bulletin addressing requirements 
  of the patient anti-dumping statute and the obligations of hospitals to medically 
  screen all patients seeking emergency services and provide stabilizing medical 
  treatment as necessary to all patients, including enrollees of managed care 
  plans, whose conditions warrant it. In developing this Special Advisory Bulletin, 
  our goal is to provide clear and meaningful advice with regard to the application 
  of the anti-dumping provisions, and to ensure greater public awareness of hospitals' 
  obligations in providing emergency medical services to those individuals insured 
  by managed care plans. </p>
<p><strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> </p>
<p>Robin Schneider, Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, (202) 619-1306 
</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> </p>
<p><u>Background</u> </p>
<p>In an effort to identify and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in the Department's 
  health care programs, the OIG periodically develops and issues Special Fraud 
  Alerts and, with the cooperation of HCFA, Advisory Bulletins to alert health 
  care providers and program beneficiaries about potential problems. On December 
  7, 1998, the OIG and HCFA jointly published a <u>Federal Register</u> notice 
  (63 FR 67486) seeking input and comments from interested parties on a proposed 
  bulletin designed to address the principal requirements of the patient anti-dumping 
  statute - known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) - 
  (section 1867 of the Social Security Act (the Act)) and to discuss how the requirements 
  of that statutory provision apply to individuals insured by managed care plans. 
  Section 1867 of the Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating 
  hospitals that offer emergency services with respect to individuals coming to 
  the hospital and seeking treatment of possible emergency medical conditions. 
  Specifically, the draft Special Advisory Bulletin sought to address: (1) the 
  obligations of hospitals to provide appropriate medical screening examinations 
  to all patients seeking emergency services and stabilizing treatment when necessary; 
  (2) some of the special concerns in the provision of emergency services to enrollees 
  of managed care plans; (3) the rules governing Medicare and Medicaid managed 
  care plans with respect to prior authorization requirements and payment for 
  emergency services; and (4) what types of practices would serve to promote hospital 
  compliance with the patient anti-dumping statute when managed care enrollees 
  seek emergency services. </p>
<p>The proposed Special Advisory Bulletin attempted to be consistent with policies 
  set forth in the <u>HCFA State Operations Manual on Provider Certification</u> 
  (Transmittal No. 2, May 1998) which provides guidelines and investigative procedures 
  for reviewing the responsibilities of Medicare participating hospitals. Hospitals 
  should also be aware that regulations at 42 CFR part 422 implementing section 
  1852(d) of the Act govern Medicare+Choice organizations' obligations to pay 
  for emergency services without regard to prior authorization or the treating 
  hospital's relationship with the plan. </p>
<p><u>Summary of Major Issues Raised</u> </p>
<p>The major issues raised by the over 150 commenters concerned dual staffing, 
  prior authorization, the use of financial responsibility forms and advanced 
  beneficiary notifications, and the handling of patient inquiries regarding the 
  obligation to pay for emergency services. Additional comments were also received 
  concerning voluntary withdrawal and the reporting of alleged patient dumping 
  violations. </p>
<p>1. <u>Dual staffing</u> </p>
<p>The majority of comments expressed concern about the impact of dual staffing 
  in hospital emergency departments (EDs), and many expressed the view that dual 
  staffing would lead to disparate standards in the ED by fostering &quot;separate 
  but unequal treatment.&quot; Possible disparate standards cited dealt with physician 
  credentialing, drug formularies, equal access and use of ancillary services, 
  consistency in specialty referrals, waiting times and quality assurance. A number 
  of emergency physicians commenting on the proposed bulletin indicated that dual 
  staffing would function to protect the financial interests of managed care organizations 
  rather than provide the highest quality of care to individuals; many hospitals 
  believed that dual staffing would add layers of bureaucracy to the system thereby 
  disrupting and delaying patient care. Of course, there may be countervailing 
  considerations relating to the benefits of flexibility and creativity in structuring 
  health delivery systems, and there is a lack of data to support some assertions 
  by those opposing dual staffing. For the Federal Government to prohibit in advance, 
  on a national level, arrangements which might increase access to health care 
  services would require some greater likelihood of risk or harm than we currently 
  foresee. (In this context, we note that States are able to restrict or prohibit 
  dual staffing arrangements within their borders.) It may or may not become evident 
  that dual staffing impedes the goals of EMTALA, or that it advances publicly 
  beneficial goals of managed care and other innovations in health care delivery, 
  such as coordination of services and health promotion. If we were to declare 
  that all dual staffing arrangements violate EMTALA, we might unnecessarily prevent 
  the development of health care delivery practices which could improve access 
  to health care. </p>
<p>Thus, we have concluded that while dual staffing raises serious issues, it 
  would not necessarily constitute a <u>per se</u> violation of the anti-dumping 
  statute. However, certain practices or occurrences that could arise in a dually 
  staffed emergency department or service could violate EMTALA. Examples of these 
  potential violations are described below. </p>
<p>2. <u>Prior authorization</u> </p>
<p>While supportive of the &quot;no prior authorization&quot; best practice outlined 
  in the proposed bulletin, many commenters argued for expanding the reach of 
  this approach beyond the current authority of HCFA and the OIG as well as the 
  patient anti-dumping statute, by making the policy applicable not only to hospitals 
  but also to health plans. Several commenters expressed concern that hospitals 
  are being forced to accept the contracts offered by managed care plans, although 
  they realize that if they comply with the prior authorization requirements in 
  the contract, the hospital could be in violation of the patient anti-dumping 
  statute. Commenters further indicated that unless prior authorization requirements 
  are abandoned or prohibited altogether, huge bills could result for patients 
  whose care had not been authorized in advance. Commenters also stated that the 
  &quot;prudent layperson&quot; standard does not sufficiently protect a hospital's 
  interest in receiving payment for the emergency services provided. </p>
<p>We were unable to resolve many of the commenters' concerns because we do not 
  have the authority under the patient anti-dumping statute to mandate reimbursement 
  for emergency services or to regulate non-Medicare and non-Medicaid managed 
  care plans. However, we have amended the prior authorization section of the 
  bulletin slightly to make it absolutely clear that an emergency physician is 
  free to phone a physician in a managed care plan at any time for a medical consultation 
  when it is in the best interest of the patient. Further, we have clarified that 
  once stabilizing treatment is under way, a managed care plan may be contacted 
  for payment authorization. </p>
<p>3. <u>Use of Advance Beneficiary Notices (ABNs) or other financial responsibility 
  forms</u> </p>
<p>With regard to the use of ABNs, commenters indicated that Medicare requires 
  ABNs to be provided to beneficiaries if the hospital is to be permitted to bill 
  the beneficiary later for a non-covered service, even for services provided 
  in an emergency context. Thus, if a Medicare managed care patient arrived at 
  the hospital and the ED physician was concerned that the plan may not cover 
  the service, the physician <u>must</u> have the patient sign an ABN or else 
  be precluded from billing the patient for the service if the plan does not pay. 
  Several comments indicated that many hospitals are using ABNs<strong> </strong>for 
  non-Medicare patients as well, even though these hospitals should be able to 
  bill these patients for services in any case. A number of commenters opposed 
  making it a &quot;best practice&quot; for hospitals not to ask patients to complete 
  financial responsibility forms upon registration, indicating that it is common 
  practice that standard consent forms are signed at the time of registration 
  which include an agreement that the patient will pay for services not covered 
  by insurance. Commenters expressed the view that as long as this practice does 
  not cause delay in screening and stabilization, it would be very inefficient 
  for a hospital to have to engage in &quot;split registration.&quot; </p>
<p>It continues to be our view that a hospital would violate the patient anti-dumping 
  statute if it delayed a medical screening examination or necessary stabilizing 
  treatment in order to prepare an ABN and obtain a beneficiary signature. The 
  best practice would be for a hospital <u>not to give</u> financial responsibility 
  forms or notices to an individual, or otherwise attempt to obtain the individual's 
  agreement to pay for services before the individual's stabilizing treatment 
  is under way. This is because the circumstances surrounding the need for such 
  services, and the individual's limited information about his or her medical 
  condition, may not permit an individual to make a rational, informed consumer 
  decision. </p>
<p>It normally is permissible to ask for general registration information prior 
  to performing an appropriate medical screening examination. The hospital may 
  not, however, condition such a screening and further treatment upon the individual's 
  completion of a financial responsibility form or provision of a co-payment for 
  any services. Such a practice could unduly deter the individual from remaining 
  at the hospital to receive care to which he or she is entitled and which the 
  hospital is obligated to provide regardless of ability to pay, and could cause 
  unnecessary delay. </p>
<p>With respect to the use of financial responsibility forms, we believe that 
  many commenters mistakenly interpreted the proposed bulletin as an attempt to 
  derail the use of reasonable hospital registration procedures that do not conflict 
  with the goals of the Patient Anti-Dumping Statute. We did not mean to give 
  that impression. We are therefore clarifying this portion of the Special Advisory 
  Bulletin consistent with the specific language set forth in the <u>HCFA State 
  Operations Manual</u>, Interpretive Guidelines of May 1998, regarding registration 
  processes permitted in the ED, which typically include the collection of demographic 
  information, insurance information, whom to contact in an emergency and other 
  relevant information. Specifically, the Interpretive Guidelines indicate that 
  a hospital &quot;may continue to follow reasonable registration processes for 
  individuals presenting with an emergency medical condition.&quot; Reasonable 
  registration processes should not unduly discourage individuals from remaining 
  for further evaluation. Reasonable registration processes may include asking 
  whether an individual is insured and, if so, what that insurance is, as long 
  as this inquiry does not delay screening or treatment.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  We are also clarifying that, while a reasonable registration process may go 
  forward prior to screening for an individual who is not in an acute emergency 
  situation, it would be impermissible for a hospital to condition a screening 
  examination or the commencement of necessary stabilizing treatment on completion 
  of a financial responsibility form. </p>
<p>4. <u>Inquiries concerning financial liability for emergency services by the 
  individual</u> </p>
<p>With regard to a hospital's handling of patient inquiries regarding the patient's 
  obligation to pay for emergency services, we recommended in the proposed bulletin 
  that such questions be answered by qualified personnel. We also recommended 
  that hospital staff encourage a patient who believes that he or she may have 
  an emergency medical condition to defer any further discussions of financial 
  responsibility until after the provision of an appropriate medical screening 
  examination and the provision of stabilizing treatment if the patient's condition 
  warrants it. Many commenters disagreed with this recommendation, indicating 
  that such a deferral may have the opposite of the intended result, since patients 
  who are unable to determine their potential financial liability may be discouraged 
  from staying at the hospital to receive an examination or treatment. As an alternative, 
  commenters recommended that hospital staff be permitted to respond to patient 
  inquiries with specific financial information so long as the hospital continues 
  to offer, and encourages the patient to stay for, a medical screening examination. 
  In addition, commenters were concerned that the absence of full and frank disclosure 
  between physicians and patients regarding treatment options, insurance coverage 
  and follow-up treatment would inhibit the examination and treatment process. 
  These commenters recommended allowing conversations about financial liability 
  issues to take place between hospital staff and patients so long as such discussions 
  do not delay screening and treatment. <br>
  <br>
  We have not substantially revised this section. We believe that it already makes 
  clear that any inquiry about financial liability should be answered as fully 
  as possible by a qualified individual. Alternatives suggested by the commenters 
  would be acceptable if such alternatives did not conflict with a minimum effort 
  to defer discussions about financial liability issues until after the provision 
  of screening and the commencement of stabilizing treatment. This section does 
  not suggest that a patient is not entitled to full disclosure, only that the 
  hospital should always convey to the patient that screening and stabilization 
  are its priorities regardless of the individual's insurance coverage or ability 
  to pay and that the hospital should discuss, to the extent possible, the medical 
  risks of leaving without a medical screening exam and/or stabilizing treatment. 
</p>
<p>5. <u>Voluntary withdrawal</u> </p>
<p>Commenters also raised concerns about the hospital's obligation in the event 
  of voluntary withdrawal by an individual, and the proposed bulletin's suggestion 
  that a number of procedures be followed and documented when a patient elects 
  to withdraw his or her request for treatment. Commenters believed that the proposed 
  procedures do not make allowance for those times when a hospital is not aware 
  of the individual's departure until after he or she has left the hospital. Commenters 
  recommended that the steps set forth in the draft bulletin should apply only 
  when the hospital knows of the withdrawal, that is, when possible, and that 
  when a person leaves without telling hospital staff, a hospital be required 
  to document the fact that a patient simply left without notice and retain the 
  log that shows that the person had been there and what time the hospital discovered 
  that the patient had left. We have revised this section to some extent. However, 
  it is our view that hospitals should be very concerned about patients leaving 
  without being screened. Since every patient who presents seeking emergency services 
  is entitled to a screening examination, a hospital could violate the patient 
  anti-dumping statute if it routinely keeps patients waiting so long that they 
  leave without being seen, particularly if the hospital does not attempt to determine 
  and document why individual patients are leaving, and reiterate to them that 
  the hospital is prepared to provide a medical screening if they stay. </p>
<p>In accordance with our assessment of the comments and issues raised, set forth 
  below is the revised OIG/HCFA Special Advisory Bulletin addressing the patient 
  dumping statute. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>OBLIGATIONS OF HOSPITALS TO RENDER EMERGENCY CARE TO 
  </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>ENROLLEES OF MANAGED CARE PLANS</strong> </p>
<p><strong>What are the Obligations of Medicare-Participating Hospitals That Offer 
  Emergency Services to Individuals Seeking Such Services? </strong> 
<ul>
  <li>The anti-dumping statute (section 1867 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 
    1395dd) sets forth the federally-mandated responsibilities of Medicare-participating 
    hospitals to individuals with potential emergency medical conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Under the anti-dumping statute, a hospital must provide to any person who 
    comes seeking emergency services an appropriate medical screening examination 
    sufficient to determine whether he or she has an emergency medical condition, 
    as defined by statute. When medically appropriate, ancillary services routinely 
    available at the hospital must be provided as part of the medical screening 
    examination. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If the person is determined to have an emergency medical condition, 
    <p>- The hospital is required to stabilize the medical condition of the individual, 
      within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital, 
      prior to discharge or transfer; or <br>
      <br>
      - If the patient's medical condition cannot be stabilized before a transfer 
      requested by the patient (or responsible medical personnel determine that 
      the medical benefits of a transfer outweigh the risks), the hospital is 
      required to follow very specific statutory requirements designed to facilitate 
      a safe transfer to another facility. </p>
  </li>
  <li>A hospital may not delay the provision of an appropriate medical screening 
    examination or further medical examination and stabilizing medical treatment 
    in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance 
    status.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Regulations implementing these statutory obligations are found at 42 CFR 
    part 489. The anti-dumping statute is enforced jointly by the Health Care 
    Financing Administration (HCFA) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
    of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sanctions that may be imposed by HHS for violations of the anti-dumping 
    statute include the termination of the hospital's provider agreement, and 
    the imposition of civil money penalties against both the hospital and the 
    physician (including on-call physicians) responsible for examination, treatment, 
    or transfer of an individual. In addition, the anti-dumping statute provides 
    for the exclusion of such physician if the violation is gross and flagrant 
    or repeated. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is there a Special Concern about the Provision of Emergency Services 
  to Enrollees of Managed Care Plans?</strong> </p>
<p>Many managed care plans require their members to seek prior authorization for 
  some medical services, including emergency services. (As explained below, a 
  Medicare or Medicaid contracting Managed Care Organization is prohibited from 
  requiring its members to seek prior authorization for emergency medical services) 
  However, as noted above, the anti-dumping statute prohibits a hospital's inquiry 
  about a patient's method of payment or insurance status, or use of such information, 
  from delaying a screening examination or stabilizing medical treatment. It has 
  come to our attention that some hospitals routinely seek prior authorization 
  from a patient's primary care physician or from the plan when a managed care 
  patient requests emergency services, since the failure to obtain authorization 
  may result in the plan refusing to pay for the emergency services. In such circumstances, 
  the patient may be personally liable for the costs. </p>
<p>A reasonable argument can be made that patients (other than those arriving 
  in dire condition) should be informed when they request emergency services of 
  their potential financial liability for services. Some would go further and 
  argue that the hospital itself should seek prior approval from the patient's 
  health plan for emergency services to preserve the patient's right to seek coverage 
  for such services. However, our concern is that such an inquiry may improperly 
  or unduly influence patients to leave the hospital without receiving an appropriate 
  medical screening examination. This result would be inconsistent with the goals 
  of the anti-dumping statute and could leave the hospital exposed to liability 
  under the statute. </p>
<p>Investigations of allegations of the anti-dumping statute violations across 
  the country have persuaded the OIG and HCFA that managed care patients may be 
  at risk of being discharged or transferred without receiving a medical screening 
  examination, largely because of the problems inherent in seeking &quot;prior 
  authorization.&quot; Hospitals sometimes are caught between the legal obligations 
  imposed under the anti-dumping statute and the terms of agreements which they 
  have with managed care plans. For example, some managed care organizations, 
  as a condition of contracting with hospitals to provide services to their enrollees, 
  have attempted to require such hospitals to obtain prior authorization from 
  the plan before screening or treating an enrollee in order to be eligible for 
  reimbursement for services provided. </p>
<p>The OIG's and HCFA's view of the legal requirements of the anti-dumping statute 
  in this situation is as follows. Notwithstanding the terms of any managed care 
  agreements between plans and hospitals, the anti-dumping statute continues to 
  govern the obligations of hospitals to screen and provide stabilizing medical 
  treatment to individuals who come to the hospital seeking emergency services 
  regardless of the individual's ability to pay. While managed care plans have 
  a financial interest in controlling the kinds of services for which they will 
  pay, and while they may have a legitimate interest in deterring their enrollees 
  from over-utilizing emergency services, no contract between a hospital and a 
  managed care plan can excuse the hospital from its anti-dumping statute obligations. 
  Once a managed care enrollee comes to a hospital that offers emergency services, 
  the hospital must provide the services required under the anti-dumping statute 
  without regard for the patient's insurance status or any prior authorization 
  requirement of such insurance.<a
href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What About Arrangements Between Hospitals and Managed Care Plans for 
  &quot;Dual Staffing&quot; of Emergency Departments?</strong> </p>
<p>Some managed care organizations (MCOs) and hospitals have entered into, or 
  are considering entering into, arrangements whereby the hospital permits the 
  MCO to station its own physicians in the hospital's emergency department, separate 
  from the hospital's own emergency physician staff, for the purpose of screening 
  and treating MCO patients who request emergency services. This kind of arrangement 
  is known as &quot;dual staffing.&quot; </p>
<p>Such arrangements can exist only where they do not violate current law. Regardless 
  of any contractual arrangement a hospital enters into to staff its emergency 
  department, the hospital remains responsible under EMTALA to provide an appropriate 
  medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical 
  condition (EMC) exists. If an EMC exists, EMTALA further provides that the hospital 
  must treat and stabilize the medical condition, unless the patient is transferred 
  in accordance with the specific requirements of the statute. </p>
<p>Also, section 1867(h) of the Act provides that a participating hospital, in 
  providing emergency medical care, &quot;may not delay provision of an appropriate 
  medical screening examination . . . or further medical examination and treatment 
  . . . in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance 
  status.&quot; A dual staffing system, based on method of payment or insurance 
  status, which creates delays in screening or stabilization violates this prohibition. 
  Also, the hospital remains responsible under the Medicare Conditions of Participation 
  as well as any other relevant patient protections and quality safeguards. Further, 
  the hospital is bound by provisions that protect whistle blowers who report 
  violations of EMTALA in dual staffing situations. <br>
  <br>
  Different points of view on dual staffing exist in the health care community. 
  It is believed by some that dual staffing in emergency departments can facilitate 
  the expeditious provision of services to MCO patients by physicians and other 
  practitioners in their own health plans. MCO ability to care for their patients 
  after stabilization, or after the absence of an EMC is determined, might be 
  enhanced by dual staffing. However, some hospitals and emergency physicians 
  have asked us to disallow dual staffing out of concern for logistical difficulties 
  and the perception that separate cannot be equal in a bifurcated emergency department. 
</p>
<p>If a hospital constructs two equally good emergency service &quot;tracks,&quot; 
  each adequately staffed and each with equally good access to all of the medical 
  capabilities of the hospital, such that both MCO and non-MCO patients receive 
  equal access to screening and stabilizing medical treatment, then such an arrangement 
  would seem to not violate the requirements of the anti-dumping statute. </p>
<p>Absent such equivalency, implementation of dual staffing raises concerns under 
  EMTALA. The following are potential violations: 
<ul>
  <li>Where the emergency department directs a hospital-owned and operated ambulance 
    differently in field care or facility destination depending on which members 
    of a dual staff (that is, either MCO or non-MCO physicians or practitioners) 
    are either on the radio to emergency medical services (EMS) or are expected 
    to see the patient.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If the emergency department alert status affecting acceptance of EMS cases 
    differs depending on which &quot;side&quot;(MCO or non-MCO) is expected to 
    see the patient.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If either the MCO or non-MCO track is understaffed or simply overcrowded, 
    and a patient in a particular track is subjected to a delay in screening and 
    stabilizing treatment, even though a physician in the alternative track was 
    available to see the individual. Where there is no emergency department policy 
    or procedure, or custom or practice, which requires cross-over coverage between 
    the dual staffs as required for patient care. (Delays in screening or stabilization 
    of patients on one track but not the other are delays in screening or stabilization 
    based on the insurance status of the individual and thus represent potential 
    violations of EMTALA.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If the hospital's emergency department quality oversight plan differs between 
    the two &quot;sides&quot; (MCO and non-MCO) of the dually staffed ED.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Where the protocols for transfer of unstable patients differ other than 
    administratively, for example, (1) if the substance of stability determination 
    criteria between the two staffs are different, or (2) when patients are unstable 
    and are transferred routinely to different facilities that are not equivalent 
    to each other in level of care or distance, and their destinations depend 
    on their insurance status.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we recognize that dual staffing will add to a hospital's burden to assure 
  that it is not violating EMTALA, we do not believe the EMTALA statute makes 
  dual staffing illegal <u>per se.</u> We expect that practical experience with 
  dually staffed emergency departments will reveal whether or not they can be 
  maintained without violating EMTALA. </p>
<p><strong>What are the Rules Governing Medicare and Medicaid Managed Care Plans 
  with Respect to Prior Authorization Requirements and Payment for Emergency Services?</strong> 
</p>
<p>There are special requirements for managed care plans that contract with Medicare 
  and Medicaid to provide services to beneficiaries of those programs. Congress 
  has specified that Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans may not require 
  prior authorization for emergency services, and must pay for such services, 
  without regard to whether the hospital providing such services has a contractual 
  relationship with the plan. Under statutory amendments recently enacted in the 
  Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33)<a
href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans are 
  prohibited from requiring prior authorization for emergency services, including 
  those that &quot;are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition.&quot; 
  Moreover, Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans are required to pay for emergency 
  services provided to their enrollees. The obligation to pay for emergency services 
  under Medicare managed care contracts is based on a &quot;prudent layperson&quot; 
  standard, which means that the need for emergency services should be determined 
  from a reasonable patient's perspective at the time of presentation of the symptoms.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
</p>
<p><strong>What Practices Will Promote Compliance with the Anti-Dumping Statute 
  by Hospitals When Managed Care Enrollees Seek Emergency Services?</strong> </p>
<p>The OIG and HCFA are concerned that discussion by hospital personnel with a 
  patient regarding the possible need for prior authorization, or his or her potential 
  financial liability for medical services provided by a hospital that offers 
  emergency services, could unduly influence patients to leave the emergency department 
  without receiving an appropriate medical screening examination or any necessary 
  stabilizing treatment. Without also informing the patient of his or her rights 
  to a medical screening examination and to stabilizing medical treatment if the 
  patient's condition warrants it and the medical risks of leaving, a discussion 
  about insurance, ability to pay and seeking prior authorization may impede a 
  hospital's compliance with its obligations under the anti-dumping statute. Discussions 
  initiated by a hospital staff member with a patient regarding potential prior 
  authorization requirements and their financial consequences that have the effect 
  of delaying a medical screening are per se violations of the anti-dumping statute. 
  Moreover, the OIG and HCFA believe that in the absence of an initial screening, 
  the decision of a managed care plan regarding the need for treatment is likely 
  to be ill-informed. Patients are entitled to receive a medical screening examination 
  and stabilizing medical treatment under the anti-dumping statute regardless 
  of a hospital's contract with a health plan that requires prior authorization. 
  Accordingly, the OIG and HCFA suggest the following practices to minimize the 
  likelihood that a hospital will violate the statute: 
<ul>
  <li><u><strong>No Prior Authorization Before Screening or Commencing Stabilizing 
    Treatment.</strong></u> 
    <p>It is not appropriate for a hospital to seek, or direct a patient to seek, 
      authorization to provide screening or stabilizing services to an individual 
      from the individual's health plan or insurance company until after the hospital 
      has provided (1) an appropriate medical screening examination to determine 
      the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition, and (2) any further 
      medical examination and treatment necessary to commence stabilization of 
      an emergency medical condition. The hospital may seek authorization for 
      payment for all services after providing a medical screening examination 
      and once necessary stabilizing treatment is underway. (We recognize that 
      this guidance differs in part from that provided in the <u>HCFA State Operations 
      Manual on Provider Certification </u>(Transmittal No.2, May 1988, Interpretive 
      Guidelines --Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency 
      Cases, Data Tag No. A406, p. V-20), which states that &quot;it is not appropriate 
      for a hospital to request or a health plan to require prior authorization 
      before a patient has received a medical screening exam to determine the 
      presence or absence of an emergency medical condition or until an emergency 
      medical condition has been stabilized.&quot; We will revise the<u> State 
      Operations Manual</u> to ensure that it conforms to the guidance provided 
      in this bulletin) We wish to emphasize that an emergency physician is not 
      precluded from contacting the patient's personal physician at any time to 
      seek advice regarding the patient's medical history and needs that may be 
      relevant to the medical screening and treatment of the patient, as long 
      as this consultation does not inappropriately delay such screening and stabilization.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><u>Use of Advance Beneficiary Notices and other Financial Responsibility 
    Forms.</u> </strong>A hospital would violate the patient anti-dumping statute 
    if it delayed a medical screening examination or necessary stabilizing treatment 
    in order to prepare an ABN and obtain a beneficiary signature. The best practice 
    would be for a hospital <u>not to give</u> financial responsibility forms 
    or notices to an individual, or otherwise attempt to obtain the individual's 
    agreement to pay for services before the individual is stabilized. This is 
    because the circumstances surrounding the need for such services, and the 
    individual's limited information about his or her medical condition, may not 
    permit an individual to make a rational, informed consumer decision. It normally 
    is permissible to ask for general registration information prior to performing 
    an appropriate medical screening examination. The hospital may not, however, 
    condition such a screening and further treatment upon the individual's completion 
    of a financial responsibility form or provision of a co-payment for any services. 
    Such a practice could unduly deter the individual from remaining at the hospital 
    to receive care to which he or she is entitled and which the hospital is obligated 
    to provide regardless of ability to pay, and could cause unnecessary delay. 
    In accordance with the <u>HCFA State Operations Manual</u>, Interpretative 
    Guidelines, V-27 (May 1998), a hospital may continue to follow reasonable 
    registration processes for individuals presenting for evaluation and treatment 
    of a medical condition. Reasonable registration processes may include asking 
    whether an individual is insured and, if so, what that insurance is, as long 
    as this inquiry does not delay screening or treatment. However, reasonable 
    registration processes should not unduly discourage patients from remaining 
    for further evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>Qualified Medical Personnel Must Perform Medical Screening Examinations 
    and Physicians Must Authorize Transfers.</u></strong> A hospital should ensure 
    that either a physician or other qualified medical personnel (that is, hospital 
    staff approved by the hospital's governing body to perform certain medical 
    functions) provides an appropriate medical screening examination to <u>all</u> 
    individuals seeking emergency services. Depending upon the individual's presenting 
    symptoms, this screening examination may range from a relatively simple examination 
    to a complex one which requires substantial use of ancillary services available 
    at the hospital and on-call physicians. If it is determined that the individual 
    has an emergency medical condition and that the individual requires a transfer, 
    only a physician (or, if a physician is not physically present in the emergency 
    department at the time, a qualified medical person in consultation with a 
    physician in accordance with regulations at 42 CFR 489.24(d)(1)(ii)(C)) may 
    authorize such a transfer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>When a Patient Inquires About Financial Liability for Emergency 
    Services.</u></strong> If a patient inquires about his or her obligation to 
    pay for emergency services, such an inquiry should be answered by a staff 
    member who has been well trained to provide information regarding potential 
    financial liability. This staff member also should be knowledgeable about 
    the hospital's anti-dumping statute obligations and should clearly inform 
    the patient that, notwithstanding the patient's ability to pay, the hospital 
    stands ready and willing to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing 
    treatment, if necessary. Hospital staff should encourage any patient who believes 
    that he or she may have an emergency medical condition to remain for the medical 
    screening examination and any necessary stabilizing treatment. Staff should 
    also encourage the patient to defer further discussion of financial responsibility 
    issues, if possible, until <u>after</u> the medical screening has been performed. 
    If the patient chooses to withdraw his or her request for examination or treatment, 
    a staff member with appropriate medical training should discuss the medical 
    issues related to a &quot;voluntary withdrawal.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>Voluntary Withdrawal.</u></strong> If an individual chooses to 
    withdraw his or her request for examination or treatment at the presenting 
    hospital, and if the hospital is aware that the individual intends to leave 
    prior to the screening examination, a hospital should take the following steps: 
    (1) offer the individual further medical examination and treatment within 
    the staff and facilities available at the hospital as may be required to identify 
    and stabilize an emergency medical condition; (2) inform the individual of 
    the benefits of such examination and treatment, and of the risks of withdrawal 
    prior to receiving such examination and treatment; and (3) take all reasonable 
    steps to secure the individual's written informed consent to refuse such examination 
    and treatment. The medical record should contain a description of risks discussed 
    and of the examination, treatment, or both, if applicable, that was refused. 
    If an individual leaves without notifying hospital personnel, the hospital 
    should, at a minimum, document the fact that the person had been there, what 
    time the hospital discovered that the patient had left, and should retain 
    all triage notes and additional records, if any. However, the burden rests 
    with the hospital to show that it has taken appropriate steps to discourage 
    an individual from leaving the hospital without evaluation.

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a><sup>1</sup> Separate and apart from the anti-dumping 
  statute, in accordance with sections 1857(g), 1876(i)(6), 1903(m)(5) and 1932(e) 
  of the Social Security Act, the OIG (acting on behalf of the Secretary) has 
  the authority to impose intermediate sanctions against Medicare and Medicaid 
  contracting managed care plans that fail to provide medically necessary services, 
  including emergency services, to enrollees where the failure adversely affects 
  (or has a substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) the enrollee. Medicare 
  and Medicaid managed care plans that fail to comply with the above provision 
  are subject to civil money penalties of up to $25,000 for each denial of medically 
  necessary services. </p>
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a><sup>2</sup> See section 4001 of the BBA, which created 
  section 1852(d) of the Act. Section 1852(d) covers emergency services and prior 
  authorization for Medicare enrollees. Also, section 4704 (a) of the BBA created 
  section 1932(b) of the Act, which contains Medicaid provisions covering emergency 
  services and prior authorization. </p>
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a><sup>3</sup> With respect to Medicare, prior authorization 
  requirements for Medicare MCO plans were already explicitly prohibited by regulations 
  before the passage of the BBA for emergency services provided outside an HMO 
  or competitive medical plan (42 CFR 417.414(c)(1)), and by implication for services 
  provided within such a plan. Similarly, while the BBA clarified and codified 
  the &quot;prudent layperson&quot; standard, a variation of this standard has 
  always been part of the Medicare policy for managed care plans. Even prior to 
  the BBA, Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans were required to reimburse 
  for emergency services provided other than through the organization. See section 
  1876(c)(4)(B), 42 CFR 417.414(c)(1) for Medicare and section 1903(m)(2)(A)(vii), 
  42 CFR 434.30(b)(2) for Medicaid. </p>
<p><a name="N_4_">4</a><sup>&nbsp; 4</sup> If, when contacted, a managed care 
  physician requests that the patient be transferred, the hospital must still 
  conclude the medical screening examination and provide any treatment necessary 
  to stabilize the patient prior to transfer, or in the case of an unstable patient, 
  provide an appropriate transfer. A hospital may only transfer an unstable patient 
  at the request of the managed care physician when either a physician at the 
  hospital certifies that the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the increased 
  risk, or when the patient requests the transfer in writing after being informed 
  of the hospital&#146;s obligations and the risks of transfer.</p>
