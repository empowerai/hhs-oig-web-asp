                            payor of all identified overpayments and must promptly repay the overpayment amount in a manner
                            consistent with the payor's policies. Although all identified overpayments should be refunded
                            to the appropriate payor, a provider under a CIA does not need to report to the OIG all identified
                            overpayments at the time it reports such amounts to the payor. Rather, the provider must report
                            to the OIG the yearly aggregate overpayment amount in its annual report. Further, the provider
                            must report to the OIG within 30 days all &quot;material deficiencies&quot; as defined by the
                            CIA. &quot;Material Deficiency&quot; generally means anything that involves:&nbsp;(i) a substantial
                            overpayment; or (ii) a matter that a reasonable person would consider a potential violation of
                            criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable to any Federal health care program for which
                            penalties or exclusion may be authorized.</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A material deficiency may be the result of an isolated
                            event or a series of occurrences. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the provider's annual or periodic review also identified
                            underpayments, the provider may work with the Federal payor to determine whether those underpayments
                            may be offset from the identified overpayment(s). Nonetheless, because the OIG is interested
                            in the identification of potential billing problems, regardless of how reporting and repayment
                            is handled with the payor(s), in its annual report, the provider must report to the OIG a gross
                            overpayment total. Thus, the provider should not report to the OIG an overpayment amount that
                            is reduced (or &quot;netted&quot;) based on underpayments. The reporting of only net overpayments
                            does not provide the OIG with a sufficient indication of potential billing problems.</font></p>

                              or numeric thresholds are appropriate for determining if there was a &quot;material deficiency&#8221; or &#8220;reportable

                          its CIAs by noting that it could be (i) a substantial overpayment or (ii) a matter that a reasonable
                          person would consider a probable violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable
                          to any Federal health care program for which penalties or exclusion may be authorized. Such a situation
                          may be the result of an isolated event or a series of occurrences. In short, a provider under a
                          CIA must determine if an identified matter requires disclosure under the CIA based on the totality
                          of the facts and the context of the surrounding circumstances. The OIG believes that a percentage
                          or numeric threshold simply constitutes the initial step in determining materiality and therefore
                          reliance solely on such a &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; threshold is inappropriate and should not
                          replace a detailed analysis of all the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>

                          (Agreements) require that a Claims Review be conducted, either by an independent review organization
                          (IRO) or in some cases by the provider, with a verification review performed by the IRO. Over the
                          past several years, the language and the claims review methodology used in these CIAs and Agreements
                          to describe the Claims Reviews have changed. </p>
                        <p>Previous language required the review to consist of a statistically valid sample of claims or
                          required the reviewer to review a Probe Sample and based on the results of the Probe Sample to
                          review a Full Sample in accordance with certain confidence and precision levels.</p>
                        <p>In response to the potential financial impact of the previous Claims Review approaches, the OIG
                          has modified its Claims Review requirements. Briefly, the new Claims Review procedures require
                          a Discovery Sample of 50 sampling units to be randomly selected for review. If the net financial
                          error rate of those 50 sampling units equals or exceeds 5%, then a Full Sample must be reviewed
                          and a Systems Review must be conducted. The Full Sample must include a sufficient number of sampling
                          units to yield results that estimate the overpayment in the population within a 90% confidence
                          and 25% precision level. As indicated in the Inspector General's November 20, 2001, Open Letter,
                          the OIG is reviewing each provider's CIA or Agreement to determine whether it is appropriate to
                          incorporate the new Claims Review procedures into the existing CIA or Agreement. </p>
                        <p>In those cases where the OIG determines that the new Claims Review provisions may be appropriate,
                          the provider will be offered the option to accept these new provisions or maintain its current
                          provisions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Purpose of Claims Review FAQs:</strong></p>
                        <p>The following is a list of questions the OIG is frequently asked by providers or their IROs regarding
                          the Claims Review. These questions are intended to provide guidance to all providers under CIAs
                          and Agreements, regardless of the specific Claims Review provisions used in the provider's CIA
                          or Agreement.</p>
                        <p> Please note: Previous CIA or Agreement review language may have been referred to as &quot;Billing
                          Review&quot; or &quot;Billing Engagement&quot; instead of &quot;Claims Review.&quot; For consistency
                          with the OIG's current review provisions, we use the term &quot;Claims Review&quot; throughout
                          this document.<br />

                        <p>Although not expressly required by all CIAs, the OIG suggests that Claims Reviews be conducted
                          in accordance with the following guidelines: </p>
                        <p>A Discovery Sample, of at least 50 sampling units, should be examined. The units for the Discovery
                          Sample should be randomly selected using a random number generator or a statistically valid manual
                          selection process (e.g., a random numbers table). For each unit reviewed, the reviewer should determine
                          the dollar difference between the provider's actual reimbursement and the amount the provider should
                          have been reimbursed (based on contractor and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&quot;CMS&quot;)
                          policies). Once all sampling units have been reviewed, the results of each sampling unit are added
                          together (underpayments may be netted or offset from overpayments). The resulting calculation is
                          the net overpayment. The reviewer divides the net overpayment by the total dollar amount of the
                          sample. The resulting calculation is the net financial error rate. </p>
                        <p>If the net financial error rate equals or exceeds 5%, we recommend that the reviewer conduct a
                          Full Sample. Based on the results of the Discovery Sample, the reviewer should estimate how many
                          sampling units will need to be reviewed to estimate the overpayment in the population within certain
                          confidence and precision levels. A 90% confidence and 25% precision level is required in current
                          CIAs. If a provider's Agreement or CIA does not specify confidence and precision levels, the OIG
                          recommends that the Full Sample results achieve a 90% confidence and 25% precision level. </p>
                        <p>The reviewer may use the Discovery Sample as a whole, as part of its Full Sample, if statistically
                          appropriate. For example, if the reviewer must examine 200 sampling units in the Full Sample, the
                          reviewer may use the results from each of the 50 units in the Discovery Sample. Therefore, the
                          reviewer only has to randomly select and review an additional 150 sampling units. The results of
                          all units reviewed as part of the complete Full Sample should be reported, i.e., 200 sampling units.</p>
                        <p>If a Full Sample was conducted, the OIG also recommends that the provider conduct a Systems Review.
                          Specifically, for each sampling unit in the Full Sample (which may include the Discovery Sample)
                          that resulted in an overpayment, the reviewer should perform a &quot;walk through&quot; of the
                          system(s) and process(es) that generated the sampling unit to identify any problems or weaknesses.
                          See response to question 28 for more details about the Systems Review.</p>
                        <p>The results of the Discovery Sample and, if applicable, the Full Sample and Systems Review, should
                          be reported to the OIG in the provider's Annual Report. See response to Question 2 for recommendations
                          regarding what to include in the report.<br />

                          review more units to reach a reasonable level of confidence and precision. If the provider believes
                          the Full Sample size is unreasonably large, it should contact its OCIG monitor for further guidance.<br />

                          actions (e.g., training). If the code was correctly assigned on the source document, the reviewer
                          should verify that it was correctly entered into the system. If correctly entered into the system,
                          the reviewer may need to review the Chargemaster or other computer software to ensure the code

                        <p> Because one of the primary purposes of a site visit is to provide the OIG with an opportunity
                          to observe the daily operations of the entity and its compliance program, the OIG does not
                          expect or encourage entities to spend excessive time or resources developing slide
                          presentations or preparing employees for interviews. Instead, the OIG's main recommendation regarding
                          site visit preparation is that the entity arrange to have employees reasonably available for discussions
                          or to answer questions. Typically, the entity's Compliance Officer and often one other member of
                          senior management accompany the OIG representatives throughout the site visit and are available
                          to answer questions. Through this less formal approach, the OIG has found that its site visits
                          cause minimal disruption to the entity's normal business operations.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />

                            claims review at any time during the course of the CIA. In the past the OIG used a contractor
                            to perform such reviews and often these reviews were performed and finalized before the OIG went
                            on site so the OIG could discuss the results with the provider during the site visit. The OIG

                            GSA invokes the "Ineligible Persons" provision of a provider's CIA. The CIA would require a provider
                            to remove an Ineligible Person from "responsibility for, or involvement with" the provider's "business
                            operations related to the Federal health care programs." A provider is also required to remove
                            an Ineligible Person from any position for which its compensation would be "paid in whole or
                            part, directly or indirectly, by Federal health care programs or otherwise with Federal funds." This
                            issue has arisen as a result of GSA's recent suspension of Arthur Andersen (Andersen), an auditing
                            firm that has been engaged as an independent review organization (IRO) by a number of providers
                            under CIAs.</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The OIG recognizes the difficult and unusual circumstances
                            Andersen's suspension has created. In the interest of causing minimal disruption to providers'
                            ongoing business operations and reducing the financial burden to providers of having to engage
                            another firm to duplicate work already performed by Andersen, the OIG has decided to waive the
                            CIA requirements that would result in immediate cessation of Andersen's involvement in the provider's
                            Federal health care program operations. The intent of this waiver is to allow Andersen to continue
                            existing IRO and other engagements, but consistent with Federal regulations regarding the effect
                            of suspension, would bar a provider from entering into, renewing, or extending engagements with
                            Andersen. This waiver applies only to this particular situation involving GSA's suspension of
                            Andersen. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pursuant to providers' Settlement Agreements with the
                            OIG and the U.S. Department of Justice, providers generally are not permitted to charge any of
                            their IRO costs to the Federal health care programs. This requirement is unchanged as a result
                            of OIG's decision to allow a provider to continue using Andersen to complete an existing IRO
                            engagement. In addition, if a provider has other engagements with Andersen, the provider should
                            confirm with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services whether the provider has any additional
                            obligations with respect to Andersen flowing from its Medicare provider agreement. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the OIG is aware that a particular provider has previously
                            retained Andersen as its IRO, the provider can expect to receive a letter from the Compliance
                            Unit of the Civil Recoveries Branch in the Office of Counsel to the Inspector General evaluating
                            the provider's CIA to determine the application of the Ineligible Persons provisions to Andersen's
                            suspension. If a provider has any questions or concerns regarding (i) this FAQ, or (ii) any existing
                            or potential relationships with Andersen or any other contractor subject to a suspension by GSA,
                            the provider should contact the Compliance Unit by calling (202) 619-2078.</font></p>
