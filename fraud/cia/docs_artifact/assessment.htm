<P><STRONG><U>Overview</U></STRONG><U></U></P>
<P>As part of an ongoing self-assessment of our health care compliance initiatives, 
  the Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted an informal survey of the results 
  of corporate integrity agreement (CIA) negotiations since the issuance of the 
  &quot;<a href="../../docs/openletters/openletter.htm">Open Letter to Health 
  Care Providers</a>&quot; in March 2000. The purpose of the review was to determine 
  the extent to which health care providers' existing compliance efforts and self-disclosure 
  of misconduct influenced the decision to require a CIA or modify specific terms. 
  An informal review of the results of recent CIA negotiations confirms that significant 
  and appropriate modifications are being made to CIAs with health care providers 
  that have established compliance programs and make disclosures of misconduct 
  to the Government.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Background</U></STRONG></P>
<P>As part of the effort to reduce fraud and abuse in the Federal health care 
  programs, the OIG and the Department of Justice use the False Claims Act (31 
  U.S.C. 3729-3733) and other authorities to sanction health care providers that 
  have knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare. In addition to the imposition 
  of monetary penalties, the OIG is authorized to exclude providers that violate 
  the False Claims Act from participation in Medicare and other Federal health 
  care programs. Absent a criminal conviction that triggers mandatory exclusion, 
  the OIG may elect not to exclude a health care provider that has engaged in 
  abusive conduct. Where the best interests of the programs are served by allowing 
  continued participation by the provider, the OIG generally requires that the 
  provider adopt specific measures to better ensure its integrity. These measures 
  are set forth in a corporate, institutional or individual integrity agreement 
  (collectively referred to as a CIA). </P>
<P>Consistent with the United States Sentencing Commission's &quot;Federal Sentencing 
  Guidelines Manual,&quot; the CIA contains the seven core elements of an effective 
  compliance program. In addition, the OIG generally requires the submission of 
  periodic reports concerning the provider's compliance efforts and reserves the 
  right to impose sanctions for a material breach of the CIA. While CIAs almost 
  always include these basic elements, the specific terms of a provider's CIA 
  are subject to extensive negotiations. Among the relevant factors considered 
  in crafting a specific CIA are the severity and extent of the underlying misconduct, 
  the provider's existing compliance infrastructure and the resources available 
  for such efforts. Perhaps the best measure of a provider's existing compliance 
  efforts is the ability to identify and respond to potential misconduct. As Inspector 
  General June Gibbs Brown observed in her March 9, 2000 &quot;<a href="../../docs/openletters/openletter.htm">Open 
  Letter to Health Care Providers</a>&quot;:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p>. . . the best evidence that a provider's compliance program is operating 
    effectively occurs when the provider, through its compliance program, identifies 
    problematic conduct, takes appropriate steps to remedy the conduct and prevent 
    it from recurring, and makes a full and timely disclosure of the misconduct 
    to appropriate authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<P>The Open Letter went on to explain that the OIG would give more deference to 
  the self-disclosing provider when negotiating a CIA and, under certain circumstances, 
  might not even require a CIA as part of the resolution of the matter.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG><U>Report of Findings</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
<P>In general, we found that when the OIG believed a CIA was necessary and where 
  there was objective evidence of a comprehensive compliance program, the OIG 
  often made two significant modifications in the CIA:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> A reduction in the term of the CIA from the 
    usual five year time period to three years; and</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> A reduction of the role of the independent 
    review organization (IRO) in those cases where the provider was able to demonstrate 
    that it had an established system of internal audits.</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>These two modifications alone represent a significant benefit to the provider. 
  Other modifications generally focused on conforming the requirements of the 
  CIA to the provider's existing compliance infrastructure. These modifications 
  to the CIA were intended to promote continuity in the provider's ongoing compliance 
  program, as well as reduce the overall costs of such efforts.</P>

  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A rural hospital in the Southeast self-reported 
    that, while under former ownership and management, it had submitted claims 
    with information that was falsified to support reimbursement. The hospital 
    uncovered the false claims during the course of an internal audit performed 
    as part of its voluntary compliance program. In the fall of 2000, the hospital 
    agreed to resolve its financial and exclusion liability. The OIG did not impose 
    a CIA because the misconduct was committed by the former management and the 
    new management disclosed its findings to the Government as part of a comprehensive 
    pre-existing compliance program. <br>

    of an internal audit performed as part of its voluntary compliance program. 
    In the summer of 2000, the hospital system agreed to resolve its False Claims

    of an internal audit performed as part of its voluntary compliance program. 
    In the summer of 2000, the hospital agreed to resolve its False Claims Act 
    liability. Because 1) the misconduct was isolated and distinct, 2) the hospital 
    disclosed its findings to the Government, 3) the damages to the Federal health 
    care programs were relatively small, and 4) the hospital had a comprehensive 
    pre-existing compliance program, the OIG did not impose a CIA.</FONT></LI>

    The hospital uncovered the false claims during the course of an internal audit 
    performed as part of its voluntary compliance program. In the fall of 2000, 
    the hospital agreed to resolve its False Claims Act liability. Since the hospital 
    disclosed its findings to the Government and had a comprehensive pre-existing 
    compliance program, the OIG imposed limited integrity measures for a term 
    of four years instead of five years, and permitted three years of internal 
    audits instead of external reviews by the IRO.<br>

    billing rules. The OIG imposed a CIA on the network for a term of five years. 
    However, the integrity obligations were tailored to the providers' pre-existing 
    compliance program. Furthermore, the physician clinics were allowed the opportunity 
    to qualify for internal annual reviews instead of reviews conducted by an 
    IRO. <br>

    the course of an internal audit performed as part of its compliance program. 
    Because the facility had disclosed the false claims to the Government, cooperated 
    with the Government to perform an internal audit, and had already implemented 
    a comprehensive pre-existing compliance program, the OIG made certain modifications 
    to the CIA. The OIG imposed corporate integrity obligations for a term of 
    three years instead of five years. Furthermore, the integrity measures were 
    tailored to the facility's pre-existing compliance program and the OIG allowed 
    internal annual reviews instead of IRO reviews.<br>

    hospitals in 20 States, entered into a global settlement in the spring of 
    2000 to resolve its False Claims Act liability arising out of its upcoding 
    of pneumonia claims at several of its hospitals. The health system 1) disclosed 
    its problems with pneumonia claims, as well as additional problems, 2) cooperated 
    with the Government to perform an internal audit with mutually agreed upon 
    parameters, and 3) had implemented a comprehensive compliance program. Based 
    on these and other facts, the OIG made certain modifications to the CIA and 
    imposed a CIA for a term of three years instead of five years. Furthermore, 
    the corporate integrity measures conformed to the hospital system's comprehensive 
    pre-existing compliance program and the IRO review was limited to the covered 
    conduct.<br>

<P>An informal review of the results of recent CIA negotiations confirms that 
  significant modifications are being made to agreements with health care providers 
  that have established compliance programs and have self-disclosed misconduct 
  to the Government. When negotiating a resolution to its administrative liability, 
  a provider is often able to limit the scope and reduce the cost of a CIA or, 
  in some instances, as a result of its self-disclosure and pre-existing compliance 
  efforts, avoid the imposition of a CIA.</P>
