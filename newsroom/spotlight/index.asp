<img class="r" src="/newsroom/spotlight/2014/images/inflated-spotlight.jpg" alt="A photo of money blowing away" width="100">
Since the Medicaid program was established, the costs and responsibilities for administering it have been shared between the States and the Federal Government.  However, a number of OIG reports have cited examples of State policies that distort the cost-sharing arrangement, causing the Federal Government to pay more than its share of Medicaid expenditures.  </dd>

<br />Fraud and waste associated with the billing of diabetes supplies has become so prevalent that OIG is taking a multi-pronged approach to fight it - focusing on prevention efforts as well as calling upon a wide arsenal of enforcement actions.</dd>

It is becoming so pervasive that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has formally labeled it an "epidemic." It is one of our nation's fastest growing public health problems, and it takes a hefty toll on individuals, families, taxpayers, and society. What is the crisis? Prescription drug abuse.

<a href="/newsroom/spotlight/2013/snf.asp">Spotlight</a> | <a href="/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#snf2013">Podcast</a><br />
Consider this scenario: a patient with a bedsore is admitted into a nursing facility.  During her stay, she develops three more bedsores.  The facility fails to track and treat each wound properly, further complicating and prolonging her healing. Unfortunately, it is not hypothetical - OIG found this and many other examples of substandard care while conducting <a href="/oei/reports/oei-02-09-00201.asp">a recent review of skilled nursing facilities</a> (SNF [pronounced "sniff"]). </dd>

Though bathing, light housework, or meal preparation may not be readily associated with the Medicaid program, these types of services - called personal care services (PCS) - allow many elderly people and those with disabilities or chronic or temporary conditions to remain in their homes and maintain basic quality of life.</dd>
