<h1>Spotlight On...<br />Bad Bargains for Federal Health Programs</h1>




<div class="related r" style="width: 255px;margin-top:4px;">
<h3>Waste:<br />A Top Management Challenge</h3>
<p>OIG selected "Avoiding Waste and Promoting Value in Health Care" as one of the 2012 Top Management and Performance Challenges. Each year, OIG develops a list identifying the problem areas it deems are the most significant issues facing HHS. These may be continuing challenges or new, emerging issues. To read more about this and other Top Management Challenges, <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/top-challenges/2012/">see the full list</a> on our website.</p>
</div>

<p>More than a quarter of all Federal dollars are spent on health programs, with $80.1 billion in the President's 2014 Budget for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In a time of budget-cutting and fiscal crises, it's more important than ever to be sure that this money is put to good use. Yet according to a 2012 Institute of Medicine report, 30% of all U.S. health spending is wasted (see side bar on waste). This equates to roughly $750 billion in 2009 alone. Some of this can be attributed to fraud but much is simply a result of inefficient spending. </p>
<p>For example, numerous OIG studies have found that Medicare and Medicaid sometimes pay significantly more than private companies do for the same medical procedure, service, or product. OIG's report on Medicare payments for laboratory tests - <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-11-00010.asp">Comparing Lab Test Payment Rates: Medicare Could Achieve Substantial Savings</a> - found that Medicare paid between 18 and 30 percent more than other insurers for all 20 of the lab tests included in the study. As Medicare is the largest payer of lab tests, this amounts to a significant payment discrepancy -- $910 million in 2011 alone. OIG recommends that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) seek legislation to lower their Medicare payment rates for lab tests as well as to introduce copayments and deductibles. </p>
<p>OIG also found several instances of payment disparities for medical supplies. The OIG report <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-07-00660.pdf">Comparison of Prices of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Pumps</a> found that in the first half of 2007, suppliers purchased new negative pressure wound therapy pumps, used to treat severe wounds and ulcers, for an average price of $3,604. In contrast, Medicare's purchase price was $17,165 for the same pump, more than four times the average purchase price. A similar pricing disparity exists with a specific type of lower-back orthotic device. The report <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-11-00600.asp">Medicare Supplier Acquisition Costs for L0631 Back Orthoses</a> found that from mid-2010 to mid-2011, while suppliers spent an average of $191 for this orthotic device, Medicare paid an average of $919. This resulted in Medicare and its beneficiaries spending a total of $37 million more than suppliers paid to acquire this one type of back orthotic alone.  </p>



<div class="related r" style="width: 255px;margin-top:4px;">
<h3>Avastin and Lucentis</h3>
<p>In addition to instances where Medicare/Medicaid is paying more than other&nbsp;payers, OIG studies also reveal cases of&nbsp;Medicare/Medicaid paying significantly more&nbsp;for one product or service than it does for a very similar or equivalent product or service. For example, there is a vast difference in the reimbursement rates for <a class="clean" href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region10/11000514.pdf"><span class="pdf">&nbsp;</span>Avastin and Lucentis</a>, two products used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. OIG estimates that in 2008-2009, Medicare Part B paid physicians $40 million for 936,382 Avastin treatments and $1.1 billion for 696,927 Lucentis treatments. Medicare pays an average of $43 for a dose of Avastin compared to $1,624 for Lucentis, a difference of $1,582 per treatment. The expense is also passed on to the patient: the average co-payment for Lucentis is $395 more than for Avastin. </p>
</div>


<p>In both cases, OIG recommended that CMS reduce the amount it pays for this equipment. OIG also recommends including these products in the Competitive Bidding Acquisition Program, which creates competition between suppliers. CMS began implementing this program in 2007 to reduce costs to beneficiaries and improve the accuracy of Medicare payments. </p>

<p>The cost of diabetes testing strips (DTS) was reduced by inclusion in Medicare's competitive bidding program. Before the bidding program, CMS paid less for mail-order DTS than for non-mail order DTS, which created an incentive for providers to bill for the more expensive non-mail-order strips. The OIG report <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-11-00760.asp">Supplier Billing for Diabetes Test Strips and Inappropriate Supplier Activities in Competitive Bidding Areas</a> found that claims for non-mail- order DTS increased by 30 percent in 2011 while claims for mail-order DTS decreased by 71 percent. As of July 1, 2013, CMS implemented changes that eliminate this disparity. </p>
<p>However, pricing disparities for DTS still exist in Medicaid. State Medicaid programs reimburse providers for DTS at varying rates. Some States use competitive bidding programs or collect rebates from the test strip manufacturers as ways to dramatically lower the cost.  If <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51100098.asp">Ohio's Medicaid program</a> used the same competitive bidding program as Medicare or if they adopted a rebate system similar to the one used by Indiana's Medicaid program, costs for DTS could be cut in half! More information is available in OIG reports on <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200011.asp">Indiana</a> and <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200009.asp">Illinois DTS payment rates</a>. </p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid programs cost a combined total of $962 billion in 2011. Continuing to identify and eliminate pricing and payment disparities could save millions - if not billions - of dollars, helping ensure that these programs can continue to provide vital services to citizens for years to come. </p>

<h3>Deadly Drug Diversion Fraud: The Case of Paul Boccone</h3>
<p>Paul Boccone was President and owner of Chantilly Specialists, a pain management clinic.  Boccone had no medical education or qualifications and hired a medical director and nurse practitioner who had no training or certification in pain management.  Our investigation found that Boccone would coerce the providers into writing medically unnecessary prescriptions for controlled substances for patients and reduced their working hours if they did not comply.  Boccone billed Medicare for many of these prescriptions.  </p>
<p>Investigators found that Boccone's "patients" often travelled 350 miles to come to his clinic to be treated for purported severe pain and received a cursory exam at best.  Boccone would encourage patients to solicit new customers to the practice, regardless of need.  He would maintain security among all the drug addicts in his lobby by carrying a taser and pistol.</p>
<p>Boccone also treated some patients himself, introducing himself as "Doctor Boccone."  He even was documented giving injections to patients.  Numerous patients sustained overdoses or died from the excessive prescribing. </p>
<p>Boccone was sentenced to 15 years in prison and the clinic was shut down. </p>
