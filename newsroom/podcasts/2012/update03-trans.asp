					<h1>Transcript for audio podcast: OIG Update May 2012</h1>


<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oig.hhs.gov">http://www.oig.hhs.gov</a></p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website at oig.hhs.gov and on Twitter @OIGatHHS.</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG issued a number of reports, including one on Medicare coding trends that found doctors have increased their billing for routine services, using more complex and expensive codes.  Another, related to Medicare Part D, found questionable billing at more than 2,600 pharmacies, leading OIG to urge strong steps to improve oversight of Part D. In yet another report, OIG recommended that New Jersey refund to Medicaid 60.7 million dollars in improperly claimed Community Care Waiver Program funds. And in a report that we previewed in our last podcast, OIG found that Medicaid may pay New York state-run developmental centers millions of dollars more than it should. </p>
<p>In other actions, Abbott Labs pleaded guilty and agreed to pay one-and-a-half billion dollars to resolve its criminal and civil liability in the off-label promotion of Depakote. The company misbranded the drug by promoting it to control agitation and aggression in elderly dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was approved by FDA.   </p>
<p>A nationwide takedown by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force nabbed 107 suspects charged in a record 452 million dollar false-billing scam. Court documents say the defendants, arrested in Florida, California, Michigan, Texas, and Louisiana, schemed to submit claims to Medicare for treatments and services that were medically unnecessary and often never provided.  In many cases, court documents allege, patient recruiters, Medicare beneficiaries and others were paid cash in return for information so that providers could submit fraudulent bills.</p>
<p> McKesson Corporation is to pay more than 190 million dollars to resolve claims that it reported inflated prescription drug prices that caused Medicaid overpayments. </p>
<p>Three defendants were sentenced to long prison terms and must repay Medicare 40 million dollars in an intricate home healthcare scam in Miami that included kickbacks, bribes, falsified patient records, and fraudulent billing. </p>
<p>A doctor and a company owner in Michigan pleaded guilty in a 13.8 million dollar Medicare home health care scam involving kickbacks, phony records, false claims, and money laundering. </p>
<p> Two owners of physical therapy clinics in Florida were charged in a 30-count indictment in a multifaceted scheme that bilked Medicare out of more than 8 million dollars. </p>
<p>A Detroit-area doctor was convicted in a 6.7 million dollar Medicare scam that exposed patients to unneeded neurological testing.  Patients were recruited with cash, prescriptions for controlled substances, and fast food.  </p>
<p>A Houston-area nurse was sentenced to more than eight years in prison in a 5.2 million dollar fraud scheme and was ordered, with others, to repay Medicare two-and-a-half million dollars.  The nurse is the seventh defendant sentenced in this scheme. </p>
<p>An employee of the National Institutes of Health, who used government credit cards to purchase items for personal use worth between 70,000 and 120,000 dollars, was convicted of theft after an OIG investigation. </p>
<p>A father of four admitted failing to pay child support for nearly two decades. As part of his guilty plea, he agreed to pay more than 94,000 dollars. His sentencing is set for July.  </p>
<p>IG Dan Levinson addressed the Health Care Compliance Association's Annual Compliance Institute. Now you can watch, listen to or read his speech on our website.</p>
<p>And here's a note especially for doctors: Physicians can earn continuing education credits by taking an online course, "Avoiding Medicare Fraud and Abuse: A Roadmap for Physicians." The course is based on information from OIG for new doctors. See our website for details.</p>
<p>The Spring 2012 Semiannual Report to Congress is available now on our website.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
