					<h1>Transcript for the audio podcast:<br />OIG Update May 2013
</h1>

<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov">http://oig.hhs.gov</a></p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website oig.hhs.gov and on Twitter @OIGatHHS.</p>
<p>In the continuing fight against health care fraud, OIG agents and others, part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/May/13-crm-553.html">seized 89 suspects in eight cities across the country</a>. The suspects were charged with $223 million dollars in false Medicare billings. IG Dan Levinson, commenting on the operation, said, "Taxpayers expect us to work harder and smarter, and that is exactly what happened..."</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG issued a number of reports.</p>
<p>OIG found in one <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31100201.asp">report</a> that Maryland improperly claimed an estimated $10.9 million dollars for personal care services under its Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services Waiver for Older Adults.</p>
<p>A second <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21101006.asp">report</a>  found that New York made at least $7.3 million dollars in unallowable Medicaid managed care payments to beneficiaries with multiple ID numbers.    </p>
<p>Another <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71001082.asp">review</a> showed that CIGNA Healthcare of Arizona was overpaid an estimated $28 million dollars because risk data that it reported to Medicare did not meet requirements. </p>
<p>A separate <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200038.asp">review</a> found Ohio Medicaid could have saved millions of dollars by establishing competitive bidding for durable medical equipment.    </p>
<p>And Illinois significantly cut Medicaid costs for home blood-glucose test strips but could save even more, OIG found in another <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200009.asp">review</a>.  </p>
<p>Listen to a <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#glucose">podcast</a> on home blood-glucose test strips on our website.</p>
<p>Another OIG <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#anesthesia">podcast</a> focuses on anesthesia service payments, and you can read the related Work Plan summary.</p>
<p>Go to our website to read an <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/files/sab-05092013.pdf">updated Special Advisory Bulletin</a> on the effect of exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.</p>
<p>Generic drugmaker Ranbaxy <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013051402">pleaded guilty to felony charges and is to pay $500 million dollars</a>. The company admitted selling adulterated drugs and making false statements to the Food and Drug Administration. The case represents the largest drug safety settlement with a generic drug manufacturer.</p>
<p>Medical products firm C.R. Bard <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013051401">is to pay more than $48 million dollars</a> to resolve allegations that it filed false Medicare claims for a prostate cancer treatment. </p>
<p>The United States has <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050301">sued Chemed Corporation and subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services and Vitas Healthcare</a>. According to the complaint, Vitas, the largest for-profit hospice in the United States, submitted false claims to Medicare, and the government contends that tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were misspent.</p>
<p>Adventist Health in Roseville, Calif., <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050601">is to pay more than $14 million dollars</a> to resolve claims that it improperly compensated doctors for referrals.</p>
<p>In another referrals case, two Montana hospitals - in a self-disclosure -- <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050201">agreed to pay nearly $4 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p>To settle a False Claims Act lawsuit, the California Rural Indian Health Board <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050202">is to pay $532,000 dollars and give up $4.6 million dollars in federal grants</a>. The settlement is the result of a four-year investigation led by OIG Special Agent Jennifer Spaulding.</p>
<p>In the wide-ranging Health Care Solutions Network mental health care scam, a former program coordinator <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013051501">was jailed for nearly 6 years and must pay more than $19 million dollars</a>.  A supervisor was convicted of orchestrating the scam in Florida and North Carolina <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013042602">and is to be sentenced in July</a>.  And a psychologist who was a clinic director <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050801"> pleaded guilty in Miami</a>. Fifteen people have been charged and 13 have entered guilty pleas.</p>
<p>A Detroit clinic owner <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050602">admitted billing Medicare more than $29 million dollars for home health and psychotherapy services that were never rendered</a>.</p>
<p>A husband was <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/detroit/press-releases/2013/clinic-owners-sentenced-for-roles-in-13.3-million-medicare-fraud-scheme">sentenced to more than 8 years and his wife 1 year</a> for submitting $10 million dollars in billings in just three months for infusion therapy treatments that were never provided. The Miami couple was also ordered to pay about $6 million dollars in restitution.</p>
<p>A Minnesota couple who had more than $10 million dollars in assets <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013050803">admitted lying to get federal aid for their disabled children</a>; the husband was jailed; fines and restitution of $1 million dollars were ordered.</p>
<p>Robert Sand, the OIG Most Wanted deadbeat parent who owed more than $1 million dollars in child support, was <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013052202">jailed for more than 2&#189; years and must pay restitution</a>.</p>
<p>A former OIG Most Wanted fugitive, Godwin Nzeocha, was <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013051301">imprisoned for more than 9 years</a> in the $45 million dollar City Nursing Medicare/Medicaid scam in Houston.</p>
<p>And two fugitives were added to OIG's Most Wanted list: <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp#jahaziel">Jahaziel Gonzalez</a> and <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp#jfernandez">Jorge Fernandez</a> were charged separately with defrauding Medicare of millions. Fernandez is believed to be in south Florida.     </p>
<p>And on a final note, OIG now allows state Medicaid fraud units to seek approval to use data mining as a way to fight fraud. <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/medicaid-fraud-control-units-mfcu/regulations_statutes/fr-2013-11735.pdf">Check our website</a>. </p>
