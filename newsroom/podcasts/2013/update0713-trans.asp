<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>Check the OIG website for the latest on our Exclusions database upgrade, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/exclusions_list.asp">including a video tutorial</a>.    </p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG issued a number of reviews.</p>
<p>Hospitals' use of observation versus short stays can be costly to Medicare and to patients, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-12-00040.asp">OIG found in one report</a>.   </p>
<p>Another found that <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-12-00290.asp">Affordable Care Act insurance co-ops appear to be making progress</a>, but success depends on a number of unpredictable factors.  </p>
<p>In another, OIG found that gaps in states' rules for license-exempt childcare providers <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-10-00231.asp">could lead to harm for children</a>.      </p>
<p>Go to our website to listen to a podcast on <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#childcare">license-exempt childcare providers</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-13-00060.asp">In another review</a>, OIG noted that some states improperly limit eligibility for Medicaid mandatory home health services for the homebound.   </p>
<p>And <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/91101006.asp">another OIG study found</a> that a California Head Start grantee claimed at least $967,000 dollars in unallowable costs; read a related <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/spotlight/2011/headstart.asp">Spotlight article on our website</a>. </p>
