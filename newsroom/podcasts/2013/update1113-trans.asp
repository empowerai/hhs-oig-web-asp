<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>We begin today with one of the largest health care fraud settlements in U.S. history. Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013110501">are to pay more than $2.2 BILLION dollars</a> to resolve criminal and civil allegations that they promoted several drugs for unapproved uses and paid millions of dollars in kickbacks.  </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/cia/agreements/Johnson_Johnson_10312013.pdf">Johnson & Johnson also agreed</a> to a corporate integrity agreement with OIG, requiring major changes in the company's business practices.  </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013111301">In another high-profile case</a>, a captured OIG Most Wanted Fugitive, Irina Shelikhova, was sent to prison for 15 years,  must forfeit more than $36 million dollars and pay nearly $51 million dollars in restitution in a health clinic scam in Brooklyn, N.Y. As part of the scheme, Medicare beneficiaries were paid kickbacks to induce them to get fraudulent services and procedures, for which Medicare was billed. The scam included a phony doctor, fictitious medical notes that were forged and money laundering. Shelikhova, one of 13 defendants convicted in the case, faces deportation from the United States after serving her sentence. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2013111803">In another New York case</a>, an ambulette driver was charged with the negligent homicide of a nursing home patient, who was 86.  The driver allegedly failed to buckle the seatbelt of the patient, who was ejected from her wheelchair when the vehicle in which she was riding came to a sudden stop. And, authorities said, the driver refused to take the patient, who was injured, to the hospital. The patient died a month after she was thrown from the wheelchair.   </p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71206038.asp">In one report</a>, OIG found that Medicare improperly paid millions of dollars for prescription drugs for thousands of unlawfully present beneficiaries. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-12-00130.asp">In another review</a>, OIG found that Medicare improperly paid $23 million dollars on behalf of deceased beneficiaries. But that figure was less than 1/10 of 1percent of 2011 expenditures.  </p>
