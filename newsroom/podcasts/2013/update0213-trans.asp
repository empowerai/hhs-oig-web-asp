<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website at (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter @OIGatHHS.</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG issued a number of reports. </p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41204019.asp">One report found</a> that the Republic of Namibia, in southern Africa, did not always properly manage U.S. AIDS-relief funds or meet program goals. </p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41204022.asp">A second report</a> from the same region noted that CDC's South Africa office did not always properly monitor the use of AIDS-relief funds.</p>
<p>Read OIG's latest <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/spotlight/2013/grants.asp">"Spotlight" on oversight and management</a> of Department of Health and Human Services grants totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-04-11-00510.asp">A third review found</a> that the Food and Drug Administration lacks data to determine whether risk strategies improve drug safety.

<p>OIG found, <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200042.asp">in another report</a>, that Indiana improperly claimed $5.8 million dollars from Medicaid for a psychiatric hospital that did not meet requirements. </p>
<p> <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-12-00310.asp">In a fifth report</a>, OIG found that Medicare could save millions on drugs infused through durable medical equipment. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has collected most Medicaid overpayments, but millions of dollars are still out there, OIG noted <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51100071.asp">in another report</a>. </p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/hcfac/index.asp">Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program report</a> has been posted on our website. In fiscal year 2012, the program recovered $4.2 BILLION dollars.  For every dollar the program spent in the last 3 years, 7 dollars and 90 cents was recovered. It is the highest three-year average return on investment in program history. </p>

<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013020401">The owner and operator</a> of 26 pharmacies in metropolitan Detroit was jailed for 17 years and must repay Medicare and Medicaid $28.8 million dollars for health care fraud and drug offenses. An OIG special agent in charge called the scheme "deplorable, inexcusable and dangerous." </p>
<p>Of the 26 defendants charged in this case, 20 have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Six are scheduled for trial in June. </p>
<p>To settle kickback and false billing allegations, <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013021202">a Florida doctor</a> is to pay more than $26 million dollars and is excluded as a provider from Federal health care programs.
