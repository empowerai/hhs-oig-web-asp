<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website oig.hhs.gov and on Twitter @OIGatHHS.</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG issued a number of reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-11-00350.asp">In one report</a>, OIG found that better use of surety bonds could enable Medicare to recover millions of dollars from medical equipment suppliers.  </p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21001024.asp">In a second review</a>, OIG noted that New York improperly claimed $27 and a half million dollars from Medicaid for family-based treatment rehabilitation services. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-13-00150.asp">And another review</a> noted that 62% of OIG-surveyed hospitals made or planned to make changes in how they acquired compounded drugs after the 2012 meningitis outbreak. </p>
<p>Medicare could have earned more than $111 million dollars in interest in 1 year, OIG found <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71105017.asp">in another report</a>, had Part D prepayment rules been different.  </p>
<p>Several new podcasts and videos have been posted on our website:</p>

<p>OIG and other federal agents <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013041703">arrested and charged the owner, the CFO, and four doctors</a> at Chicago's Sacred Heart Hospital in an alleged kickback scheme that involved patient referrals to the hospital.</p>
