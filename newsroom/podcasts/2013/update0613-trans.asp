</h1>

<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov">http://oig.hhs.gov</a></p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website at oig.hhs.gov and on Twitter @OIGatHHS.</p>
<p>OIG testified on Capitol Hill on Medicare Part D vulnerabilities, oversight, and prescription drug abuse. <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/testimony/docs/2013/cantrell_wright_testimony_06242013.pdf">Read the testimony on our website</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-09-00608.asp">OIG also issued a pair of reports related to Part D</a>. One found that Medicare paid for drugs ordered by people who clearly did not have prescribing authority, raising safety issues.</p>
<p>The other review <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-09-00603.asp">found questionable prescribing patterns</a> for potentially addictive and other drugs in the Part D program.   </p>
<p>Don't miss our latest OIG Spotlight - focusing on <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/spotlight/2013/diversion.asp">the epidemic of drug diversion</a>, a form of prescription drug abuse.  </p>
<p>And you can go to our website to listen to <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#diversion">a podcast on drug diversion</a>.  </p>
<p>An OIG report contributed to <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21102004.pdf">the successful prosecution of Pedro Espada Jr.</a>, the former New York Senate majority leader.   </p>
<p><a class="exit" href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2013/2013jun14.html">Espada was jailed for five years</a> for thefts from clinics that served the poor in the Bronx. He was also convicted of filing a false tax return and must repay hundreds of thousands of dollars.    </p>
<p></p>
<p>In another report, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-11-00010.asp">an OIG rate comparison showed</a> that Medicare could save more than $900 million dollars on lab tests.</p>
<p>In another, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21001043.asp">OIG found that New York claimed</a> an estimated $54 million dollars from Medicaid for unallowable traumatic brain injury waiver program services.    </p>
<p>Go to our website to listen to a podcast on the <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#tbi">traumatic brain injury waiver program report</a>.  </p>
<p>To learn about <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#csbg">OIG oversight of community block grant spending at a Connecticut nonprofit</a>, listen to a separate podcast, also on our website. </p>
<p>OIG found in another report <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-09-00440.asp">that improvements are needed</a> to ensure that Medicare provider enrollment data are accurate, complete and consistent.</p>
<p>And yet another review noted that <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region1/11200507.asp">Medicare could save millions by implementing</a> a hospital transfer policy for early hospice discharges. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013052801">ISTA Pharmaceuticals is to pay $33.5 million dollars</a> to resolve criminal and civil liability linked to its marketing, distribution and sale of the drug Xibrom. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013052201">U.S. Renal Care is to pay $7.3 million dollars</a> to resolve allegations that it submitted false claims to Medicare for dialysis drugs given to patients.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013061102">Seven in New Jersey admitted taking part in a conspiracy</a> to pay physicians millions of dollars in bribes over a number of years in exchange for blood sample referrals that brought a clinical laboratory more than $100 million dollars.   </p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013060602">A former dentist, excluded as a provider</a> from participation in federal health care programs, admitted using an elaborate scheme to defraud Connecticut Medicaid of more than $20 million dollars. He also pleaded guilty to tax evasion and has agreed to forfeit property and cash, pay back taxes, interest and penalties of nearly $2 million dollars and pay $9.9 million dollars in a civil settlement. </p>
<p>Two Texas doctors, a married couple, were <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013060402">ordered to pay over $37 million dollars</a> in restitution plus a money judgment of more than $37 million dollars for their decade-long scam of billing for injection procedures that they did not perform. </p>
<p>A Kentucky cardiologist admitted falsely recording patients' conditions<a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2013060703"></a> and fraudulently billing Medicare for stent procedures. He is the third cardiologist in the nation to be federally prosecuted for heart stent surgery fraud.  </p>
<p>OIG Most Wanted fugitive Won Suk Lee, charged in $2.1 million dollar Medicare false claims case, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/captured_profiles.asp#won">was arrested in Los Angeles</a>.  </p>

She is accused in a $5.1 million dollar scheme. </p>
<p>A multijurisdictional task force in Orange County, N.Y., rounded up 42 deadbeat parents who, authorities say, together owed more than $1.4 million dollars in child support.   </p>
<p>Among them was <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/child-support-enforcement/ea.asp">Dee Dee Riggs</a>, an OIG Most Wanted deadbeat parent. Authorities say Riggs, who was being held in Orange County in lieu of bail, owes more than $329,000 dollars.  </p>
