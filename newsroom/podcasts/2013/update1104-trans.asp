<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41207033.asp">OIG found in another review</a> that the University of Miami Hospital received an estimated $3.7 million dollars in overpayments from Medicare because the hospital lacked adequate controls to prevent billing errors.  </p>

Mentally disabled residents and people seeking narcotics were promised that, if they signed up for psychotherapy services, they could see a doctor who would prescribe the drugs they wanted.

The Pennsylvania man also diverted money, spending it on extensive home renovations, travel expenses, his son's college tuition, and a luxury car. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nyw/press/press_releases/2013/oct/Fitzgerald.html">And in New York, a man who posed as a doctor</a> was sentenced to two years in jail and ordered to pay more than $220,000 dollars in restitution. A 5-year-old died shortly after treatment by the defendant, according to evidence presented during the prosecution.   </p>
