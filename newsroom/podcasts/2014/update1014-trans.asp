<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>The OIG FY 2015 Work Plan is on our website now - don't miss it! http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/index.asp#current </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014101003 ">Nursing home chain Extendicare</a> agreed to pay $38 million dollars in a quality-of-care settlement with OIG. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to correct alleged serious lapses that affect seniors. </p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/other/181330331.asp">OIG found</a> that the Food and Drug Administration should address cyber vulnerabilities on its network that could lead to a data breach. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region6/61200053.asp">Texas improperly claimed</a> an estimated $30.3 million dollars for nonemergency medical transportation services in FY 2011, OIG found in a second review.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region1/11300003.asp">OIG noted in one report</a> that Massachusetts received about $106 million dollars more than it should have because of incorrect Medicaid claim adjustments, and OIG recommended that the state refund the money to the federal government. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-11-00320.asp">In another report</a>, OIG recommended strengthened oversight of state standards for access to care in Medicaid managed care programs. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21301004.asp">In a fifth review</a>, OIG noted that New York claimed an estimated $23 million dollars in Medicaid reimbursement for unallowable supported employment services. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014092502">Shire Pharmaceuticals</a> in Wayne, Pa., is to pay $56.5 million dollars to resolve civil allegations that it improperly marketed and promoted several drugs. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2014101602">Drugmaker Organon</a> is to pay $31 million dollars to settle allegations of false claims to state Medicaid programs. Authorities say Organon underpaid rebates, offered improper incentives and illegally promoted its antidepressants.  </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014102101">A Houston hospital president</a>, his son and two others were convicted in a $158 million dollar scam that included sham mental health services, kickbacks, false claims and money laundering. Ten defendants have now been convicted in the fraud scheme.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014102103">An Akron doctor admitted</a> illegally prescribing hundreds of thousands of painkillers and other pills for no legitimate medical purpose. The physician continued to illegally prescribe pills, even after some of his customers suffered overdose-related deaths. Steven M. Dettelbach, U.S.  attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said the doctor "is simply a drug dealer who happened to wear a white coat and worked from a medical office instead of a street corner. His actions destroyed lives and families."</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014100302">A Florida doctor and two others</a> were charged in a $55 million dollar mental health clinic scheme that involved alleged false billing and ineligible patients.</p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014091802">A Florida home health agency</a> and its owners are to pay $1.65 million dollars to resolve false claims allegations. The agency allegedly paid spouses of referring doctors for sham jobs that required little or no work. The salaries allegedly served as an inducement and reward for the physicians' referrals of Medicare patients.       </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014092602">Seven were charged</a> and three others entered guilty pleas in a $56 million dollar home health and durable medical equipment scheme in Louisiana. </p>
