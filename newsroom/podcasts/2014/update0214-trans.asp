<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program recovered a record $4.3 billion dollars in fiscal year 2013. Government healthcare-fraud-fighting teams have recovered $19.2 billion dollars over the last five years. And listen to this: For every dollar spent fighting fraud over the last three years, the government recovered eight dollars and 10 cents. It's all on our website. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2014pres/02/20140226a.html">Check it out</a>. </p>
<p>OIG's "<a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/outlook/index.asp">Outlook 2014</a>" and the <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/index.asp#current">2014 Work Plan</a> are on our website, too. Take a look. </p>
<p>Erin Bliss, Director of External Affairs, <a class="exit" href="http://www.federalnewsradio.com/85/3562258/Federal-Drive-Show-Blog---February-13-2014">was interviewed recently</a> on Federal News Radio and discussed what's ahead for OIG in 2014.</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-11-00370.asp">OIG found in one report</a> that one-third of Medicare nursing home residents were harmed as a result of medical care. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#adverse14">Listen to a podcast</a> about the adverse events report. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-12-00710.asp">In another study</a>, OIG found that states successfully implemented Medicaid cost-control measures for incontinence supplies, but further work was recommended.   </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21102003.asp">In another review</a>, OIG recommended that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strengthen its monitoring of World Trade Center Health Program contract terms. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#wtc">Listen to a podcast</a> on our website about the World Trade Center Health Program. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71206035.asp">OIG found in one report</a> that Medicare improperly paid for drugs for incarcerated individuals; stronger internal controls were recommended. </p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-12-00480.asp">OIG recommended</a> a path to big Medicare savings: Expand the "window" for billing outpatient services linked to hospital admissions. </p>

<p>"The safety and efficacy of drugs must be shown by science, not sales pitches," a U.S. attorney said. <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014022401">Endo Health Solutions and Endo Pharmaceuticals are to pay</a> $192.7 million dollars to resolve liability linked to the marketing of the painkiller Lidoderm for unapproved uses. IG Dan Levinson said: "...Endo profited at the expense of taxpayers and could have put patients at risk."

More than 20 suspects were arrested and charged in a multimillion-dollar home-health billing fraud case. OIG Special Agent in Charge Nicholas DiGiulio said: "Criminal organizations that steal from the District of Columbia Medicaid program are robbing the bank of healthcare money and cheating honest citizens."</p>
<p>A Florida man who owned rehabilitation facilities pleaded guilty and a disbarred North Carolina attorney admitted her role in a $28.3 million dollar healthcare fraud that involved services that were not legitimately prescribed or not provided; he could get <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014020401">15 years in prison</a>, and she could get <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014012701">10 years</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014021401">Randy Lee Essary</a>, a former OIG deadbeat parent from Missouri, admitted failing to pay more than $164,000 dollars in child support.  </p>
