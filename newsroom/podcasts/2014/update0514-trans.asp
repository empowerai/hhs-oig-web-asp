<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/semiannual/index.asp">OIG's spring Semiannual Report to Congress</a>, highlighting our work in the first half of the fiscal year - including more than $3.1 billion dollars in expected recoveries -- is on our website now; check it out.</p>
<p>Also posted is an <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/alerts/bulletins/index.asp#charity-bulletin">OIG Supplemental Special Advisory Bulletin</a>: Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs. The bulletin expands on 2005 guidance, focusing on key safeguards to ensure the charities' independence from donors.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014051303">OIG agents were involved</a> in a joint enforcement operation across the United States, aimed at stemming the tide of healthcare fraud. Ninety people were charged in six cities with submitting about $260 million dollars in fraudulent healthcare billing. In Florida alone, 57 were charged.  OIG deployed more than 150 special agents and forensic specialists for the operation.</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-13-00270.asp">In one report</a>, OIG urged establishing a method to identify Medicare Part B claims for compounded drugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21201031.asp">In another</a>, it was found that New York claimed $60.8 million dollars in unallowable room-and-board costs under its developmental disabilities waiver program.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-10-00181.asp">And OIG found</a> that Medicare inappropriately paid $6.7 billion dollars for evaluation and management services billed by physicians in 2010.</p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/91302036.asp">Medicare overpaid hospitals $19.5 million dollars</a> over four years because of improperly coded patient discharge claims, OIG noted in another report.</p>
