<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2014/cshm.asp">OIG excluded CSHM Incorporated</a>, the manager/operator of Small Smiles Dental Centers, from participation in federal healthcare programs for 5 years. The exclusion is based on alleged material breaches of a corporate integrity agreement with OIG. Inspector General Dan Levinson asserted that the health and safety of young patients and quality of care were put at risk. To minimize disruptions in healthcare, the exclusion is effective Sept. 30, 2014.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/video/index.asp#hcca2014">watch</a> or <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/speeches.asp#hcca2014">listen</a> to IG Levinson's HCCA Compliance Institute keynote presentation. </p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-12-00330.asp">In one study</a>, OIG noted questionable billing in New York: Medicaid paid 29 dentists $13.2 million dollars in 2012 for pediatric services. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/2014/dentistry-trans.asp">related podcast</a> is available on our website.   </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-12-00420.asp">OIG urged more monitoring</a> after it noted that nearly 5,000 doctors had submitted questionable Medicare billing for electrodiagnostic tests. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services generally selected suppliers and computed payment for medical equipment properly under a competitive bidding program, OIG found <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/51200067.asp">in another report</a>.</p>
<p>To hear more about the medical equipment Competitive Bidding Round 1 Rebid Program, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#dme">listen to our podcast</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-12-00390.asp">OIG noted in another review</a> that, for nearly one-third of home health claims, doctors' records of face-to-face encounters with patients did not meet Medicare requirements.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#face">Listen to a podcast</a> on limited compliance with home health face-to-face documentation requirements. </p>

"Health care providers that try to make a quick buck by billing taxpayers for services never provided will instead pay a high price for their greed-fueled fraud," said Gerald Roy, an OIG Special Agent in Charge.   </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014041101">Two North Carolina women</a> were sentenced to long prison terms for fraud; together they are to repay more than $10 million dollars.

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014032601">A New York physician was accused</a> of "creating phantom medical procedures" and falsely billing Medicare for $85 million dollars. OIG Special Agent in Charge Thomas O'Donnell said:  "For a single physician, the alleged conduct in this case is among the most serious I've seen in my law enforcement career."   </p>
<p>Two doctors became <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014032602">the 25th</a> and <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2014041003">26th defendants</a> convicted of taking bribes in a long-running New Jersey lab referral case.
