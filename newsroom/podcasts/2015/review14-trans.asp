          <br />2014 Year in Review OIG Update</h1>

<p>From the Office of Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov">http://oig.hhs.gov</a></p>


<p>Welcome to the Office of Inspector General's 2014 in Review, a look back at OIG highlights of our continuing battle against fraud, waste and abuse in Department of Health and Human Services programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.  </p>
<p><a href="http://go.usa.gov/evaA">OIG reported</a> nearly $5 billion dollars in expected recoveries in fiscal 2014. The recoveries resulted from program audits and investigations. </p>
<p><a href="http://go.usa.gov/evjR">And OIG reported</a> 971 actions against individuals or entities that engaged in crimes against HHS programs as well as 533 civil actions during the fiscal year. </p>
<p><a href="http://go.usa.gov/evYG">Medicare Strike Force effort</a>s by OIG and our partners at the Department of Justice resulted in the filing of charges in 232 criminal actions. </p>
<p>And six <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/index.asp">OIG Most Wanted fugitives</a> were captured during the year. </p>
<p><a href="http://go.usa.gov/evCB">OIG excluded</a> from participation in federal healthcare programs more than 4,000 individuals and entities during 2014. Among them was <a href="http://go.usa.gov/ezfe">pediatric dental management chain</a> CSHM, for "repeated and flagrant violations" that put kids at risk.    </p>
<p>Promoting healthcare compliance, <a href="http://go.usa.gov/ezfY ">OIG negotiated</a> more than 40 corporate integrity agreements, among them one with the Extendicare nursing home chain that alleged "effectively worthless care." Extendicare agreed to pay $38 million dollars. </p>
<p><a href="http://go.usa.gov/evCw">OIG found that</a>, after health insurance marketplaces first opened, they faced major challenges with inconsistencies in applicant data. </p>
<p>And OIG's report, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-13-00670.asp">Access to Care: Provider Availability in Medicaid Managed Care</a>, found that slightly more than half of Medicaid managed care providers could not offer appointments to enrollees. </p>
<p>"Hospitals should be required to perform random drug tests on all health care workers with access to drugs." That was <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2014/drug-tested.asp">the message from an op-ed piece</a> by IG Dan Levinson and Special Agent Erika T. Broadhurst, published in the New York Times. </p>
<p>OIG testified at 10 hearings on Capitol Hill in 2014. You can read <a href="http://go.usa.gov/evrx">that testimony</a> on our website. </p>
<p>In an effort to provide important information about OIG's work, <a href="http://go.usa.gov/evrh">more than 35 podcasts</a> were added to our website in 2014.    </p>
<p>Join OIG in its fight against healthcare fraud, waste and abuse --  watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlsnd1DYG6Y">Report Fraud video</a> - our most viewed  in 2014 -- on our YouTube site:  #OIGin2014</p>
