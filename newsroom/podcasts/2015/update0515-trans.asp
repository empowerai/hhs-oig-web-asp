<p>OIG's Gerry Roy, Special Agent in Charge in Kansas City, talked with KMOV, St. Louis, about a podiatrist who defrauded Medicare of nearly $1 million dollars. <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/video/index.asp#groy0513">See the video</a> on our website.</p>
<p>And OIG's <a class="exit" href="http://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/marketplace-wednesday-may-6-2015">Nancy Harrison was interviewed</a> about hospice care on American Public Media's "Marketplace."</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reports.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-14-00480.asp">Questionable billing</a> and quality of care are among the issues raised in an OIG study of pediatric dentistry in California Medicaid.</p>
<p>OIG found <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region1/11300506.asp">in one report</a> that incorrect place-of-service coding by physicians resulted in potential overpayments that cost Medicare millions.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-13-00600.asp">The Food and Drug Administration</a> improved its oversight and inspections of manufacturers of generic drugs, OIG found in a third report.</p>
<p>And OIG noted <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region1/171552000.asp">in another study</a>  that the Department of Health and Human Services complied in many respects with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, but it did not fully comply for fiscal year 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015050601">A New York doctor</a> and clinics owner was convicted of overseeing the illegal distribution of $165 million dollars' worth of oxycodone pills. Doctors employed at the clinics wrote 35,000 medically unneeded prescriptions. And crowds of up to 100 people gathered daily at one of the clinics, clamoring for the illegal prescriptions.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015051502">Two doctors</a>, a nurse and an office manager were convicted in a $50 million dollar home health scheme in Louisiana that cheated Medicare for more than 10 years.</p>

And the U.S. intervened in a lawsuit against Novartis, which allegedly paid Accredo kickbacks for increased refills of Exjade. The government also alleged that the defendants understated the drug's potentially life-threatening side effects.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015051501">PharMerica</a>, a pharmacy corporation that dispenses medications to residents of long-term-care facilities, is to pay $31.5 million dollars to settle allegations that it dispensed Schedule II drugs without valid prescriptions and filed false Medicare claims. The corporation also agreed to enter into a five-year corporate integrity agreement with OIG.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015051504">Westchester Medical Center</a> in New York is to pay nearly $19 million dollars to settle civil fraud claims tied to violations of the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law. OIG Special Agent in Charge Scott Lampert said, "Westchester Medical Center's aggressive, intricate kickbacks and other fraud schemes in this case threatened the impartiality of medical referrals, the financial integrity of Medicare, and the public's trust in the health care system."</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015050801">Sixteen hospitals</a>, mostly in the South, are, together, to pay nearly $16 million dollars to resolve allegations that they billed Medicare for unneeded psychotherapy.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015042801">A Georgia medical center</a> is to pay $20 million dollars to settle allegations that it billed for more expensive patient services than it should have.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2015051201">The ringleader</a> of a New Jersey Medicaid scam involving imaging centers that he owned pleaded guilty to bribing dozens of doctors for referrals. He is to be imprisoned for 10 years, and repayment of $1 million dollars has been ordered. He will also be barred for life as a Medicaid provider.
Three more doctors were jailed - two of them for more than three years -- in a massive bribes-for-referrals laboratory scam in New Jersey; the three physicians must pay fines and forfeitures totaling more than $1.2 million dollars.
