<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reports.</p>
<p>OIG found <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71403199.asp">in one review</a> that not all Colorado marketplace controls ensured that applicants were enrolled in Affordable Care Act health plans according to federal rules.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/91503004.asp">In another study</a>, OIG raised concerns about high-risk security vulnerabilities in Medicaid systems at three managed care organizations in California.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-12-00680.asp">In a third review</a>, OIG found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has not performed required closeouts of contracts worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Listen to a podcast on the <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#closeout2015">contract-closeouts report</a>. Visit our website!</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/21301016.asp">New York State improperly claimed</a> at least $70 million dollars in Medicaid reimbursement for some adult day healthcare services, OIG noted in a fourth report.</p>

Authorities allege that the man, a drug wholesaler, purchased prescription medications on the black market and resold them as new to pharmacies across the United States, putting customers at risk. The alleged scam was dangerous to the thousands of patients who ultimately took these black market medications, not knowing that they had been prescribed to others and then resold and trafficked, often in unsafe conditions, authorities said.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015121702">Two Louisiana doctors and a nurse</a> were given long jail terms in a $50 million dollar home health fraud scheme; millions of dollars in restitution was ordered.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015121704">Qualitest Pharmaceuticals</a> is to pay $39 million dollars in a civil fraud settlement. The company admitted that it sold half-strength fluoride tablets, causing federal healthcare programs to be fraudulently billed millions of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015122103">32 hospitals in 15 states</a> are to pay more than $28 million dollars total to settle allegations of false claims linked to spinal treatment.</p>

The government alleged that Medicare was improperly billed for splints provided to patients in skilled nursing facilities.</p>
<p><a href="arrangements.http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015120101">A Texas management firm</a> is to pay more than $3 million dollars to settle claims that it engaged in "ambulance swapping" kickback arrangements. Authorities, including OIG, allege that the management company got free or discounted patient transport in exchange for referring to ambulance companies other lucrative Medicare and Medicaid business. The settlement is believed to be the first in the nation to hold accountable hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in addition to ambulance companies for these kinds of "ambulance swapping"</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2015112701">New York resolved a lawsuit</a> over an Alzheimer drug by allowing low-cost generic drugs to enter the market unimpeded.

<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015121601">A New York physician's assistant was imprisoned</a> for 11 years in a massive oxycodone distribution conspiracy. He was also ordered to forfeit more than $1.8 million dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2015112303">A doctor in Texas and his assistant entered guilty pleas</a> in a healthcare fraud and kickback scheme.
