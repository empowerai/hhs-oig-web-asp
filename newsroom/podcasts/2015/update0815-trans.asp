<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reports.</p></p>
<p>In one report (<a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/91401011.pdf">A-09-14-01011</a>), OIG recommended that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services improve insurance marketplace controls for verifying eligibility and resolving inconsistencies.</p>

The businessman paid kickbacks to patient recruiters to obtain the information of beneficiaries, which he then used to bill Medicare for services that were not medically necessary or were not provided. And he admitted creating fake patient files to deceive an auditor. Eleven other defendants have been convicted in this case.</p>

<p>In a case of drug diversion, <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2015081301">a New York nurse admitted stealing</a> narcotics meant for nursing home patients. She used the drugs herself.  </p>
<p><a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2015081201">Another New York nurse was charged</a> with using forged prescriptions to get more than 2,000 narcotic pills - and Medicaid paid the bill, authorities allege. </p>

Authorities said the scam included billing for medical services that were unnecessary or not provided. The couple allegedly billed for trigger point injections, for which Medicare pays between $58 and $60 each, but instead administered vitamin B-12 shots, for which Medicare pays about 66 cents each. The couple also billed for medical services on days when they drove patients to restaurants for parties, authorities said. The two are believed to be in Spain.</p>
