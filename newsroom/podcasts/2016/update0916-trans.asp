<p>Welcome to one of a continuing series of podcasts highlighting the work of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p>This is Mike Kane, inviting you to follow us on our website (oig.hhs.gov) and on Twitter (@OIGatHHS).</p>
<p>Since our last podcast, OIG has issued a number of reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region6/61100004.asp">OIG found that Texas claimed</a> $57.9 million dollars in unallowable supplemental payments made to University of Texas health institutions over three years.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41508039.asp">In a second review</a>, OIG noted that Colorado received $38.3 million dollars in unallowable Children’s Health Insurance Program bonus payments for fiscal years 2010 through 2013.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/91502036.asp">In another study</a>, OIG found that Arizona made incorrect electronic health record incentive payments, totaling $14.8 million dollars, to 24 OIG-reviewed hospitals.</p>
<p>OIG’s latest “<a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/video/2016/eoo/index.asp">Eye on Oversight: Critical Incidents in Group Homes</a>” is on our website now. When officials fail to alert states about potential abuse or neglect, residents are put at risk. To watch the video, visit our website.</p>

<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/state/index.asp#SEA2016081202">A licensed practical nurse</a> who owned an assisted-living facility in Florida was charged with aggravated manslaughter of an 80-year-old resident by culpable negligence. Authorities said that the nurse, among other things, failed to adequately treat the resident’s ulcers. Over several months, the resident’s condition worsened.

<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2016081101">A former community health clinic CFO</a> in Alabama was sent to prison for 17 years and must forfeit nearly $2 million dollars in a complex fraud scheme.</p>

His false diagnoses earned bribes and kickbacks from thousands of people who sought to cheat the Social Security Administration and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Authorities said the psychiatrist submitted false claims to Medicare and Medicaid for office visits that were not needed and not provided. And the psychiatrist issued prescriptions for medications to support false disability claims. Medicaid paid for those unneeded medications.</p>

<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2016081602">An Illinois doctor was sent to prison</a> for two years for taking kickbacks in exchange for referring elderly patients to a Chicago hospital. The scheme earned the now-closed hospital millions of dollars in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2016082201">A physician in California</a> was sentenced to four years in prison after falsely certifying that at least 79 Medicare and Medicaid patients were qualified for hospice care because they were terminally ill. Authorities said most of the patients were not dying. The doctor was also ordered to repay more than $1.3 million dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/criminal/index.asp#CEA2016081201">The owner of a New Orleans medical equipment company</a> was jailed for 80 months in a $3.3 million dollar false billing case. He is to repay more than $2 million dollars.</p>
