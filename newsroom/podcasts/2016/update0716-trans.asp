<p>OIG and its federal and state partners <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/media-materials/2016/takedown.asp">arrested a record 301 suspects</a> in a nationwide healthcare fraud takedown. The suspects were accused of Medicare and Medicaid fraud approaching $1 billion dollars. Unprecedented federal-state cooperation and the use of advanced data analytics were critical in the operation. More than 1,000 law enforcement personnel, including over 350 OIG special agents, made arrests from Alaska to Florida. For more information, visit the OIG website.</p>

OIG found that FDA did not have an efficient and effective food recall initiation process that helps ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. Consumers were at risk of illness or death for weeks after FDA knew of potentially hazardous food, OIG determined. For more information, visit our website.</p>
