<h1>Council Elects New Chairperson</h1>
<p><img alt="Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency" src="cigie-logo.jpg" height="97" width="458"  /></p>

<p>For Immediate Release<br />
January  5, 2015<br />
Washington, DC</p>
<p><strong>Contact: Mark Jones</strong><br />
Executive Director<br />
(202) 292-2600</p>

<p>The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency announces its newly elected Chairperson, the Honorable Michael E. Horowitz, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  Mr. Horowitz began his term on January 1, 2015, replacing the Honorable Phyllis K. Fong, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Agriculture, who previously served as Chairperson since the Council's establishment 6 years ago.  Mr. Horowitz was elected in December in a vote of the 72 Federal Inspectors General who make up the Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Horowitz was sworn in as the DOJ Inspector General (IG) on April 16, 2012, following his confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  Prior to serving as DOJ IG, Mr. Horowitz worked as a partner Cadwalader, Wickersham, & Taft LLP, and from 2003 to 2009 was a Commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission.  Mr. Horowitz previously served in DOJ from 1991 to 2002, first as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York and then as a high-level official in the DOJ Criminal Division.  (A more complete biography for Mr. Horowitz can be located at <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/about/meet-ig.htm" target="_new">http://www.justice.gov/oig/about/meet-ig.htm</a>)</p> 

<p>Mr. Horowitz appointed Ms. Allison C. Lerner, the IG at the National Science Foundation (NSF), to serve as Vice Chairperson for the Council.  Ms. Lerner takes over from Ms. Lynne McFarland, Federal Election Commission IG, who served in this position the past 2 years.  Ms. Lerner was appointed NSF IG in April 2009.  Prior to her service as NSF IG, Ms. Lerner served in a variety of positions at the Department of Commerce IG, including as Counsel to the Inspector General.  (A more complete biography for Ms. Lerner can be located at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/oig/alerner.jsp" target="_new">http://www.nsf.gov/oig/alerner.jsp</a>.)</p> 

<p>Both Mr. Horowitz and Ms. Lerner will continue to serve as IGs of their respective agencies.</p>

<p>"I am honored to be elected Chairperson and excited to build on the excellent work of my predecessor, Phyllis Fong," said Mr. Horowitz.  "I look forward to working closely with Allison Lerner and the rest of my colleagues to strengthen the IG community and ensure that Federal IGs remain capable of providing the independent, effective oversight that the American people expect and deserve."</p>

<p>The Council is an independent Federal entity whose mission is to address integrity, economy, and effectiveness issues that transcend individual Government agencies; and increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well-trained and highly skilled workforce in the offices of the Inspectors General.</p>

<p>The Council consists of 72 Federal IGs from both the Executive and Legislative branches, and 6 other Federal leaders, including the Honorable Beth Cobert, Deputy Director for Management, Office of Management and Budget, who serves as the Council's Executive Chairperson.</p>
