<p><strong>Washington, DC</strong> - Parents who are years behind on child support payments or who have fled to avoid paying up will now have a tougher time hiding from their court-ordered obligations, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services announced today.</p>
<p>OIG launched a new Child Support Enforcement Web page that enlists the public's help in ongoing Federal efforts to bring fugitive deadbeat parents to justice. The Web site is <a href="/fraud/child-support-enforcement/">http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/child-support-enforcement/</a>. </p>
<p>"There are parents and children across the country who need help," said Inspector General Daniel Levinson. "Visit our new Web site to see if you recognize any of the featured fugitives - and submit any helpful tips that will aid us in locating them."</p>
<p>The new Child Support Enforcement Web page includes photos and information on some of OIG's most wanted deadbeat parents. The site also includes an online fugitive tip form and OIG's hotline number (1-888-476-4453) to report fugitive-related information in either English or Spanish, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. </p>
<p>"OIG agents tirelessly pursue fugitives who skip out on their court-ordered child support payments," said Gerald T. Roy, OIG's Deputy Inspector General for Investigations. "We have a global reach.  We will find you so you can be held accountable for meeting your responsibilities to your children."</p>
<p>The list currently features five wanted fugitives and two who have been recently captured. Robert Sand, from Nassau County, NY, is currently the Government's Most Wanted Deadbeat Parent. First ordered to pay child support in 1996, Sand owes more than $1 million in child support payments for his three children from two marriages. Four other fugitives, who owe child support amounts ranging from $21,000 to $68,000, are also featured on the Web page. The two captured fugitives - Glen Sheppard and Rusty Haile - owed $164,000 and $116,727. </p>
<p>Most child support cases fall under State jurisdiction, but the Federal Government can intervene in cases in which parents don't pay child support for more than one year or noncustodial parents owe more than $5,000 and their children live in a different State. Intervention is also permitted when noncustodial parents flee the State or country to avoid paying child support.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the Federal Government has convicted more than 500 deadbeat parents who failed to pay more than $33 million in child support payments. </p>
