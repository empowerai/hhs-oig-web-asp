<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<p>Good Afternoon, Mr. Chairman.  I am June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General of the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is
to identify ways to improve HHS programs and operations and protect them against fraud, waste,
and abuse.  We do this by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and
investigations, which provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Department
officials, the Administration, the Congress, and the public.  In carrying out our mission, we work
with the Department and its operating divisions, the Department of Justice (DOJ), other Federal
and State agencies, and the Congress to bring about systemic improvements in HHS programs
and operations, and to prosecute and/or recover funds from those who defraud the Government.</p>
<p><strong>OIG FUNDING SOURCES</strong>
<p>The Office of Inspector General has two separate funding sources.  First, we receive funding
from the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program, established by the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which funds our Medicare and
Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse activities.  From the $182 million appropriated for HCFAC
Program in FY 2001, the OIG will receive between $120 million and $130 million.  Actual
allocation of the FY 2001 HCFAC Program resources, as required by law (HIPAA), will be
determined jointly by the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General.
<p>We also receive a discretionary appropriation which is used to fund our oversight of all other
HHS programs and operations, such as public health, children and families, aging, and
departmental management.  The OIG's discretionary budget request for FY 2001 is for 306 FTE
and $33.8 million, an increase of $2.4 million above the FY 2000 operating level.  This increase
provides for annualization of the January 2000 pay raise, the anticipated January 2001 pay raise,
other mandatory and inflationary costs and the planned expansion of the Child Support
Enforcement Task Force.
<p><strong>APPROACHES</strong>

<p>We pursue a number of approaches to deal with fraud, waste, and abuse in HHS programs.  Our
comprehensive program of audits and evaluations are designed to detect problems in the early
stages and to define their nature and magnitude.  When we find problems, we recommend
corrective action. In contrast, our program of investigations is designed to identify, investigate,
and prosecute cases of suspected fraud.  Such cases often arise from whistleblowers who report
direct knowledge of illegal practices, from beneficiaries who report questionable billings,
through the DOJ, and from our own reviews and analysis.  We seek appropriate remedies, such
as restitution, fines, penalties, settlements, and convictions.  In addition, we exclude the most
egregious abusive providers from participating in Medicare and other Federal health care
programs.
<p>In recent years, we have expanded our effectiveness by partnering with other HHS offices, other
Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the health care provider community to
achieve common goals.  For example, we work with the Administration for Children and
Families' Office of Child Support Enforcement and Federal, State, and local law enforcement
agencies to recover delinquent child support payments from runaway parents.
<p>As another example, we work with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to extract
data from its information systems to spot areas where Medicare may be paying too much, or
where "billing spikes" indicate possible abuse.   HCFA's contractor fraud units and medical
reviewers assist us in detecting and evaluating false billings and schemes.  We also work side-by-side with the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys, other Offices of Inspector General, and State and local
law enforcement officials to investigate potential fraud cases and curb abusive behavior.  In
addition, we often join with State officials to review Medicaid issues.
<p>I am pleased to add that we work increasingly with representatives of the health care provider
community to develop reasonable and voluntary compliance guidelines for insuring accurate
billings to the Medicare program.  We also enlist the support of Medicare beneficiaries.  We
encourage the beneficiaries to carefully review their health care bills.  When they spot a possible
improper item, a service or product not received, for example, we ask them to call their health
care provider.  If that fails to "clear up" the matter, we suggest they call their Medicare
contractor, and then, if still unsatisfied, to report a suspected fraud to the OIG hotline.  Our OIG
hotline currently receives about 11,000 calls each week.
<p><strong>FY 1999 ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong>

<p>The heightened focus on fraud and abuse by my office, HCFA, the FBI, the DOJ, the Congress,
and others, is yielding substantial recoveries, savings, and program improvements.  During
Fiscal Year 1999, we excluded more than 2,976 abusive or fraudulent individuals and entities
from doing business with Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal and State health care programs. 
The 1999 accomplishments include 401 convictions of individuals or entities that engaged in
crimes against departmental programs, and 541 civil actions.  We increased convictions by
nearly 20 percent in 1997, another 16 percent in 1998, and by almost 54 percent in 1999.
<p>We reported overall savings of $12.6 billion for Fiscal Year 1999.  This is comprised of $251.5
million in audit disallowances, $407.7 million in investigative receivables, and $11.9 billion in
savings from implemented legislative or regulatory recommendations and actions to put funds to
better use. The savings that result from our recommendations that are implemented into law or
regulation, and independently scored by the Congressional Budget Office or HCFA, represent
taxpayer or Medicare Trust Fund dollars that will not be spent.
<p><em><strong>Medicare and Medicaid Accomplishments:</strong></em>
<p>Last month, my office reported the results of our fourth annual projection of improper payments
made for Medicare fee-for-service claims.  Over the four years we have conducted this review,
the improper payment rate declined by 42 percent, from a midpoint of $23.2 billion (14 percent)
in 1996,  to $13.5 billion (7.97 percent) in FY 1999--a drop of $9.7 billion.  Many Medicare
watchers attribute at least part of  this downward trend to the increased oversight and
enforcement efforts of our office, HCFA, DoJ and the FBI that were made possible by the steady
funding stream created by HIPAA.  According to the Medicare Trustees and the Congressional
Budget Office, these fraud and abuse efforts contributed to Medicare's record low inflation rate
(estimated at a negative .7 percent for FY 1999) and the extension of the viability of the Trust
Fund until 2015.   This year, we found a slight, but statistically insignificant, increase in the error
rate, reflecting a pause in the decline of improper payments.  Although we are heartened by the
overall accomplishment, the level of improper payments is still too great a loss for taxpayers to
suffer.  It is not a time to let down our guard on Medicare.  We are also working with three pilot
States to establish what the error rate is for Medicaid.
<p>A cornerstone of our prevention efforts has been the development of compliance program
guidance to encourage and assist the private health care industry in the fight against fraud and
abuse.  The guidance is developed in cooperation with the provider community and identifies
steps that health care providers may voluntarily take to improve their adherence to Medicare and
Medicaid rules.  We have published eight compliance guidance documents covering hospitals,
clinical laboratories, home health agencies, third-party billing companies, durable medical
equipment, hospices, Medicare + Choice organizations, and nursing facilities.  We have recently
invited comments on our draft guidance related to individual physicians and small group
practices.
<p>In FY 1999, we reported an all-time high of 303 health care related convictions and 534 health
care related civil actions.  About $369 million was returned to the Medicare trust funds in 1999
as a result of anti-fraud activities, and an additional $4.7 million was recovered as the Federal
share of Medicaid restitution. The HIPAA funded many types of anti-fraud and program quality
efforts in Medicare, including: False Claims Act settlements; patient anti-dumping enforcement
under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act; reviews of quality of care in
nursing homes; hospital quality oversight; and mental health services, including partial
hospitalization programs in community mental health centers.  In FY 1999 we increased our
collaboration with others through implementing self-disclosure protocols, conducting a joint
roundtable with the health care industry on compliance, increasing data sharing with the FBI,
and stepping up our Federal-State Medicaid audit partnerships.  To date, we have audit
partnerships in 22 States.  Between 1994 and the end of 1999, these joint activities with the
States generated about $145 million in Federal and State savings.
<p><em><strong>Other HHS Programs Accomplishments:</strong></em>

<p>Our work on the Department's programs other than Medicare and Medicaid focused on quality of
services and identifying ways to deliver services more effectively and efficiently.  In these
programs, we reported 98 convictions;  7 civil actions; and savings, disallowances, and
receivables of $345 million.  The FY 1999 non-Medicare and Medicaid projects that were
funded through our discretionary appropriation included reviews and investigative activities
related to:  (1) State compliance with Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility requirements; (2) Child
Support Enforcement; increased child support collections; (3) paternity establishment; (4) the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) program; (5) Indian Health
Service (IHS) Contract Health Service program; (6) Institutional Review Boards; (7) distribution
of organs for transplantation; (8) Office of Community Services (OCS) grants; (9) Interstate
Compact on the Placement of Children; (10) States' child care certificate systems; and (11) the
Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) handling of adverse drug reactions.  We also used a
portion of the discretionary budget for expanding the toll-free hotline.  Following are examples
of our discretionary work:
<ul>
  <li><em>Child Support Enforcement:</em>  From January 1995 through the end of CY 1999, the OIG
opened 860 child support cases nationwide that resulted in 173 convictions and court-ordered restitution of over $11.2 million in payments to custodial parents.  In addition,
the OIG released a series of five inspection reports examining the paternity establishment
    process.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em>Institutional Review Boards</em>:  We issued four reports addressing problems with
institutional review boards (IRBs) in protecting human subjects participating in clinical
research.  We concluded that the IRB's are reviewing too much, too quickly, with too
little expertise, and are facing conflicts that threaten their independence.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><em>Distribution of Organs for Transplantation:</em>  We updated a 1991 report and found that
both racial and geographic disparities in waiting times still exist and, in some cases, seem
to be growing for those waiting for transplant organs.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>PROJECTS PLANNED OR UNDERWAY<br>
</strong>

<br wp="br1">Almost 80 percent of our resources in FY 2001 are provided from the HCFAC account and will
be dedicated to Medicare and Medicaid audits, evaluations, and enforcement activities.  The
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which manages Medicare and Medicaid, has
more than $325 billion in budget authority in FY 2000 and estimates almost $350 billion in
budget authority in FY 2001.  The remaining 20 percent of our resources are provided by the
discretionary budget and will be used to audit, evaluate, and investigate the Department's other
300 plus programs, which account for $69.4 billion of budget authority in FY 2000 and about
$78 Billion in FY 2001.
<p><em><strong>Medicare and Medicaid Projects:</strong></em>
<p>The Medicare related subjects for which we have projects planned or underway that should be
completed within the FY 2000 through 2001 period include:  improper hospital discharges and
