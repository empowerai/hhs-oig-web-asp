Inspector General<br>
Department of Health and Human Services</strong>

<p align="left"> <strong>March 9, 2000</strong><hr size="1">


Good morning, Mr. Chairman.  I am June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General of the Department of
Health and Human Services.  With me today is Joseph E. Vengrin, Assistant Inspector General for
Audit Operations and Financial Statement Activities.  I am pleased to report to you on the Health
Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) progress in reducing Medicare payment errors and in
presenting reliable financial information.
<p>My statement today will focus first on our audit of Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 Medicare fee-for-service
payments.  This was our fourth annual estimate of the extent of fee-for-service payments that did not
comply with laws and regulations.  As part of our analysis, we profiled all 4 years' results and
identified specific trends, where appropriate, by the major types of errors found and the types of
health care providers whose claims were erroneous.  Then I will briefly describe the significant
findings of our audit of HCFA's FY 1999 financial statements, which is required by the Government
Management Reform Act of 1994.  The purpose of financial statements is to accurately portray
agencies' financial operations, including what they own (assets), what they owe (liabilities), and
how they spend taxpayer dollars.  The purpose of our audit was to independently evaluate the
statements.
<p>Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the cooperation and support we received from the
Department, HCFA, and the General Accounting Office (GAO).  The HCFA's assistance in making
available medical review staff at the Medicare contractors and the peer review organizations (PRO)
was invaluable in reviewing benefit payments.  Also, I want to point out that we worked closely with
GAO, which is responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements of the Federal
Government.  The Department is one of the most significant agencies included in these
Governmentwide statements.
<p><strong><em>MEDICARE PAYMENT ERRORS</em>

</strong>
<p><strong><em>Overview</em></strong>
<p>With expenditures of approximately $316 billion, assets of $212 billion, and liabilities of $39
billion, HCFA is the largest component of the Department.  The HCFA is also the largest single
purchaser of health care in the world.  In 1999, Medicare and Medicaid outlays represented 33.7
cents of every dollar of health care spent in the United States.  In view of Medicare's 39.5 million
beneficiaries, 870 million claims processed and paid annually, complex reimbursement rules, and
decentralized operations, the program is inherently at high risk for payment errors.
<p>Like other insurers, Medicare makes payments based on a standard claim form.  Providers typically
bill Medicare using standard procedure codes without submitting detailed supporting medical
records.  However, regulations specifically require providers to retain supporting documentation and
to make it available upon request.
<p>As part of our first audit of the HCFA financial statements for FY 1996, we began reviewing claim
expenditures and supporting medical records.  At HCFA's request, we have continued these reviews
because of the high risk of Medicare payment errors and the huge dollar impact on the financial
statements ($169.5 billion in FY 1999 fee-for-service claims).
<p>Our primary objective each year has been to determine whether Medicare benefit payments were
made in accordance with Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) and implementing
regulations.  Specifically, we examined whether services were (1) furnished by certified Medicare
providers to eligible beneficiaries; (2) reimbursed by HCFA's Medicare contractors in accordance
with Medicare laws and regulations; and (3) medically necessary, accurately coded, and sufficiently
supported in the beneficiaries' medical records.
<p><strong><em>Sampling Methodology</em></strong>

<p>To accomplish our objective, we used a multistage, stratified sample design.  The first stage
consisted of a selection of 12 contractor quarters for FY 1999.  The selection of the contractor
quarters was based on probabilities proportional to the FY 1998 fee-for-service benefit payments. 
The second stage consisted of a stratified, random sample of 50 beneficiaries from each contractor
quarter.<strong>  </strong>The resulting sample of 600 beneficiaries produced 5,223 claims valued at $5.4 million for
review.
<p>For each selected beneficiary during the 3-month period, we reviewed all claims processed for
payment.  We first contacted each provider in our sample by letter requesting copies of all medical
records supporting services billed.  In the event that we did not receive a response, we made
numerous follow-up contacts by letter, telephone calls, and/or onsite visits.  Then medical review
staff from the Medicare contractors (fiscal intermediaries and carriers) and PROs assessed the
medical records to determine whether the services billed were reasonable, adequately supported,
medically necessary, and coded in accordance with Medicare reimbursement rules and regulations.
<p>Concurrent with the medical reviews, we made additional detailed claim reviews to determine
whether (1) the contractor paid, recorded, and reported the claim correctly; (2) the beneficiary and
the provider met all Medicare eligibility requirements; (3) the contractor did not make duplicate
payments or payments for which another primary insurer should have been responsible under
Medicare secondary payer requirements; and (4) all services were subjected to applicable deductible
and co-insurance amounts and were priced in accordance with payment regulations.
<p><strong><em>Sample Results </em></strong>

<p>Through detailed medical and audit review of a statistical selection of 600 beneficiaries nationwide
with 5,223 fee-for-service claims processed for payment during FY 1999, we found that 1,034
claims did not comply with Medicare laws and regulations.  <strong>By projecting these sample results, we
estimated that FY 1999 net payment errors totaled about $13.5 billion nationwide, or about
7.97 percent of total Medicare fee-for-service benefit payments.  </strong>This is the mid-point of the
estimated range, at the 95 percent confidence level, of $9.1 billion to $17.9 billion, or 5.4 percent to
10.6 percent, respectively.  As in past years, the payment errors could range from inadvertent
mistakes to outright fraud and abuse, such as phony records or kickbacks.  We cannot quantify what
portion of the error rate is attributable to fraud.
<p>Medical professionals detected 92 percent of the improper payments.  When these claims were
submitted for payment to Medicare contractors, they contained no visible errors.  It should be noted
that the HCFA contractors' claim processing controls were generally adequate for (1) ensuring
beneficiary and provider Medicare eligibility, (2) pricing claims based on information submitted,
and (3) ensuring that the services as billed were allowable under Medicare rules and regulations. 
However, their controls were not effective in detecting the types of errors we found.
<p><strong><em>Historical Analysis of Error Rates</em></strong>

<p>Our analysis of payment errors from FY 1996 through FY 1999 demonstrates HCFA's continued
vigilance in monitoring and reducing payment errors.  This year's $13.5 billion estimate is, in fact,
$9.7 billion less than the FY 1996 estimate.  In addition, our audit results clearly show that the
majority of health care providers submit claims to Medicare for services that are medically
necessary, billed correctly, and sufficiently supported.  For both FYs 1998 and 1999, we estimated
that over 90 percent of fee-for-service payments contained no errors.  This is a very positive
reflection on the diligence of the health care provider community to comply with Medicare
reimbursement requirements.  However, our analysis shows that unsupported and medically
unnecessary services continue to be pervasive problems.  These two error categories accounted for
more than 70 percent of the total improper payments over the 4 years.
<p>The attached chart presents an historical analysis of improper payments by major error categories:<br>
(1) unsupported services, (2) medically unnecessary services, (3) incorrect coding, and (4)
noncovered services and miscellaneous errors.
<p><strong><em>Unsupported Services</em>

</strong>
<p>Unsupported services represented the largest error category every year except FY 1998, when they
dropped dramatically.  This year we saw a $3.4 billion increase over last year's estimate; however,
these errors remained below the levels found in FYs 1996 and 1997.
<p>Medicare regulation, 42 CFR 482.24(c) specifically requires providers to maintain records that
contain sufficient support to justify diagnoses, admissions, treatments performed, and continued
care.  When the records were insufficient or missing, medical reviewers could not determine
whether services billed were actually provided to Medicare beneficiaries, the extent of the services,
or their medical necessity.  It should be noted that HCFA upheld 99 percent of the overpayments
identified in the FY 1998 sample and recovered about 87 percent; the remaining 13 percent has not
been collected due to an ongoing investigation.
<p>This year's estimated $5.5 billion in unsupported services consisted of $4.5 billion in claims for
which medical review staff found that the documentation was insufficient to support the billed
services and $1 billion in claims for which no documentation was provided.  These errors were
largely attributable to three provider groups:  home health agencies ($1.7 billion), durable medical
equipment (DME) suppliers ($1.6 billion), and physicians ($1.1 billion).
<p>Some examples of unsupported services follow:
<ul>
  <li>
<p><strong></strong>A <strong>home health agency</strong> was paid $84 for a psychiatric nurse visit to a patient.  While
documentation evidenced that the visit had been made, neither the patient's plan of care nor
the doctor's orders authorized the home health agency to provide the psychiatric nursing
care.  As a result, medical reviewers denied the payment.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p><strong></strong>A <strong>DME supplier</strong> was paid $815 for an enteral feeding supply kit, a gastrostomy tube, and
380 units of enteral formula.  Medical review staff concluded that the supplier's
documentation was not sufficient to support the claim because the records did not include
physician progress notes, laboratory values, radiological studies ordered, or weight charts.  In
addition, because the delivery ticket did not provide individual beneficiary information,
medical reviewers were unable to determine what products were delivered and to whom.  As
a result, the total payment was denied.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p><strong></strong>A <strong>physician</strong> was paid $28 for a hospital visit.  However, medical reviewers found a note in
the medical records which stated, "Pt [patient] not in room."  Because a patient encounter
could not be verified and no other documentation substantiated the visit, the payment was
denied.
<p><em><strong>Medically Unnecessary Services</strong></em> 

<p>Medically unnecessary services constituted a significant part of the historical error rate:  37 percent
of the improper payments in both FYs 1996 and 1997, 56 percent in FY 1998, and 32 percent in FY
1999.  For these errors, medical reviewers found enough documentation in the medical records to
make an informed decision that the medical services or products received were not medically
necessary.  <strong>As in past years, Medicare contractor or PRO medical staff made decisions on
medical necessity using Medicare reimbursement rules and regulations.</strong>  They followed their
normal claim review procedures to determine whether the medical records supported the claims.
<p>These types of errors in inpatient prospective payment system (PPS) claims were significant in all 4
years (FY 1996 - 39 percent of the total $8.5 billion; FY 1997 - 31 percent of the total $7.5 billion;
FY 1998 - 40 percent of the total $7 billion; and FY 1999 - 45 percent of the total $4.4 billion).  For
example:<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>A <strong>PPS hospital</strong> was paid $3,883 to treat an inpatient with an episode of hypoglycemia. 
According to medical reviewers, the patient's condition and the treatment given did not
require admission to the acute level of care, and the patient could have been safely evaluated
and treated at a less acute level.  Therefore, the entire payment was denied as medically
unnecessary.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Another <strong>PPS hospital</strong> was paid $7,642 to treat an inpatient for dehydration.  The
beneficiary, who was initially treated in the emergency room, was eventually admitted to the
hospital's acute care unit.  The beneficiary received x-rays, blood tests, IV fluids, Tylenol,
and a fever work-up but was discharged the same day.  Medical reviewers concluded that the
patient's condition did not require acute hospital inpatient care and that the services could
have been rendered in an outpatient setting.  Therefore, the entire payment was denied.
<p><strong><em>Incorrect Coding</em></strong>

<p>The medical industry uses a standard coding system to bill Medicare for services provided.
For most of the coding errors found, medical reviewers determined that the documentation
submitted by providers supported a lower reimbursement code.  However, we did find a few
instances of downcoding which we offset against identified upcoding situations.
<p>Incorrect coding was the third highest error category this year, with $2.1 billion in improper
payments.  Physician and inpatient PPS claims accounted for 90 percent of the coding errors over
the 4 years reviewed.
<p>Examples of incorrect coding follow:
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
<p>A<strong> PPS hospital</strong> was paid $9,387 for an inpatient respiratory system surgical procedure.  The
medical records, however, supported a nonsurgical procedure.  Medical reviewers' correction
of the procedure code produced a lesser valued diagnosis-related group of $2,481, resulting
in denial of $6,905 of the payment.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>A <strong>physician</strong> was paid $50 for a psychotherapy session which requires medical evaluation
and management.  According to medical review staff, the physician's records evidenced
neither the time spent nor the psychotherapy services performed.  However, the records
supported psychiatric medication management services in an office setting, for which a lower
level of service would have been appropriate.  Therefore, $31 of the payment was denied.
<p><strong><em>Noncovered Services</em></strong>

<p>Errors due to noncovered services consistently constituted the smallest error category.  Noncovered
services are defined as those that Medicare will not reimburse because the services do not meet
Medicare reimbursement rules and regulations.  For example:<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>A <strong>physician </strong>was paid $30 for nail debridement.  Medicare covers this procedure if there is
evidence of diabetes in the beneficiary's medical history.  However, there was no indication
of diabetes in this beneficiary's history.  Therefore, the service was considered routine foot
care, which Medicare does not cover, and payment was denied.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>A <strong>hospital</strong> was paid $21 for medications to an outpatient that medical reviewers determined
could have been self-administered.  Medications furnished in an outpatient setting are
covered only if they are of a type that cannot be self-administered.  As a result, medical
reviewers denied the payment.
<p><strong><em>FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT</em></strong>
<p><strong><em>Audit Opinion</em></strong>
<p>For FY 1999, we are very pleased to issue the first unqualified, or "clean," audit opinion on HCFA's
financial statements.  In achieving this important milestone in financial accountability, HCFA has
successfully resolved billions of dollars in past problems that formed the basis of our audit opinion
for 3 years.  Deficiencies in reporting and supporting Medicare accounts receivable, in particular,
have been systemic and longstanding.
<p>Medicare accounts receivable are debts that providers and other entities owe to HCFA.  More than
50 Medicare contractors are responsible for tracking and collecting most of this debt through their
claim processing systems.  However, as we previously reported, their claim processing systems
lacked general ledger capabilities and traditional accounting system features, such as a dual-entry
process.  In addition, the contractors used ad hoc spreadsheet applications to tabulate, summarize,
and report information to HCFA.  This reporting process was labor intensive, requiring significant
manual input and reconciliations between various systems and spreadsheets.  Previous audits found
millions of dollars in discrepancies as a result; that is, the Medicare contractors were unable to
support beginning balances, reported incorrect activity, and could not reconcile ending balances with
subsidiary records.
<p>This year HCFA embarked on an extensive effort to validate and document receivables.  The
project, which was jointly conducted by HCFA, my office, and two independent accounting firms,
covered accounts receivable at 15 Medicare contractors (accounting for over 80 percent of the
contractor receivable balance) and at the HCFA central and regional offices.  The validation team
identified over $2 billion in overstated and understated receivables:
</ul>

<ul>
	  <li>$1.3 billion lacked supporting documentation,
</ul>

<ul>
	  <li>$1 billion concerned cash advances to providers for which claims had already been
submitted, and
</ul>

<ul>
	  <li>$191 million in misstatements resulted from clerical errors, e.g., a contractor
erroneously recorded a $50 receivable as $70 million.
<p>This validation effort, together with HCFA's aggressive action to require that contractors maintain
support for this debt, enabled us to conclude that the receivables balance was fairly presented and
sufficiently documented for the first time in 4 years.
<p><strong><em>Internal Control Weaknesses</em></strong>

<p>While the receivables balance was supported at the end of FY 1999, the underlying internal control
environment and accounting systems still need substantial improvements, such as a basic double-entry bookkeeping system and adequate checks and balances to promptly detect errors and
irregularities.  These control weaknesses impair HCFA's ability to accumulate and analyze accounts
receivable activity and to ensure that future receivables will be properly reflected in financial
reports.  These weaknesses also increase the risk that future debt may not be collected timely and
that receivables may not be properly safeguarded.  Compounding these problems, the HCFA central
office does not routinely analyze receivable balances other than on a very aggregate level. 
Therefore, the FY 1999 report on internal controls again includes Medicare accounts receivable as a
material weakness.  Material weaknesses are defined as serious deficiencies in internal controls that
can lead to material misstatements of amounts reported in subsequent financial statements unless
corrective actions are taken.  To ensure that future accounts receivable activity and balances are
fairly stated, HCFA will need to continue a very aggressive validation effort.
<p>The other material weaknesses noted last year also carried over:<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p><strong>Financial systems and reporting.  </strong>Controls over financial systems and reporting remain
serious concerns.  The HCFA did not perform adequate analyses of accounts receivable,
revenues, and expenditures to understand why fluctuations took place and to ensure that
balances were correct.   For example:
</ul>

<ul>
	  <li>The HCFA did not independently verify the Medicare Supplementary Medical
Insurance (SMI) and Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund balances, did not reconcile
these accounts at a sufficiently detailed level, and used ineffective methodologies to
calculate SMI and HI transfers.  As a result, the SMI fund was underfunded by $18 billion and HI was overfunded by $14 billion.  The SMI fund lost interest
earnings of $237 million and the HI fund realized excess interest earnings of $154 million as a consequence.  Although aggregate fund balances with Treasury and
investment balances for the trust funds were properly stated in the FY 1999 financial
statements, cash transfers related to the principal to make the individual trust funds
whole did not occur until October 1999.
</ul>

<ul>
	  <li>The HCFA did not periodically validate the National Claims History File to ensure
the existence and completeness of the data.  Due to a breakdown in internal quality
controls, the file was missing 100 million Medicare claims amounting to over $13 billion from June until December 1999.  This file, which has since been
corrected, is critical to accurately estimate Medicare benefits payable, to prepare the
Medicare trustees report, to determine the SMI monthly premiums, to establish
managed care rates, to update the diagnostic-related groups for inpatient hospitals,
and to develop annual budget projections.
<p>	The HCFA had to make billions of dollars in manual adjustments to payables and receivables
before producing final, auditable financial statements in late January 2000 -- 4 months after
the fiscal year ended.  In addition, we noted that five of eight sampled Medicare contractors
did not formally reconcile paid claims activity to monthly expenditures reported to HCFA. 
Without these reconciliations, the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements 
increases.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p><strong>Medicare electronic data processing (EDP).</strong>  Because HCFA's FY 1999 resources were
largely devoted to Year 2000 readiness issues, not all prior-year EDP control problems were
resolved.  Weaknesses remained in access controls at the HCFA central office and in
application change controls at a "shared" system used by certain Medicare contractors to
process and pay claims.  Internal controls over Medicare systems are essential to ensure the
integrity, confidentiality, and reliability of critical data while reducing the risk of errors,
fraud, and other illegal acts.
<p><strong><em>Controls Over Cash Management</em></strong>
<p>In a matter related to our financial statement audit, we recently reviewed certain controls over cash
management.  The HCFA and the Medicare contractors have agreements with several banks to
maintain Medicare accounts to cover payments to providers.  The HCFA expressed concerns about
the way one bank handled Medicare funds related to eight fiscal intermediaries and one carrier.  At
HCFA's request, we reviewed the financial activities of the bank and the Medicare contractors.  We
noted that during an 11-day period, the bank withdrew funds from the Federal Reserve in excess of
Medicare contractor expenditures.  The excess ranged from $104 million to over $420 million per
day and earned more than $700,000 in interest.
<p>In addition, since 1993, the bank has routinely withdrawn funds a day earlier than needed to cover
Medicare expenses and has earned interest on those funds by investing them overnight.  The bank
estimated that the interest earned through these overnight investments totaled $12.5 million.  In
1999, HCFA advised the bank to stop this practice because it was contrary to the provisions of the
agreement with HCFA and the Medicare contractors.  Bank officials believed that withdrawing
funds a day early was a "perk" of maintaining Medicare accounts and that bank charges alone were
not sufficient to cover administrative expenses for the accounts.
<p>Each of the Medicare contractors has a monthly limit on the total amount of Medicare funds that can
be drawn down by the bank, and HCFA and its contractors have various reconciliation procedures to
compare bank cash draws to expenditures and to Federal Reserve Bank reports.  However, these
controls were ineffective in preventing both types of improper withdrawals made by the bank.
<p><strong><em>CONCLUSIONS</em> <em>AND RECOMMENDATIONS</em></strong>

<p>We are encouraged by HCFA's sustained success in reducing Medicare payment errors and by the
important progress made in resolving prior years' financial reporting problems.  We remain
concerned, however, that inadequate internal controls over accounts receivable leave the Medicare
program vulnerable to potential loss or misstatement.  As HCFA begins a lengthy process to
integrate its accounting system with the Medicare contractor systems, internal controls must be
strengthened to ensure that debt is accurately recorded, an adequate debt collection process is in
place, and information is properly reflected on the financial statements.
<p>We offered a number of recommendations which, if implemented, will strengthen controls over
receivables and financial reporting.  With the Year 2000 remediation challenge successfully
completed, we urge HCFA to focus on these critical internal controls while continuing its efforts to
reduce improper payments and ensure provider integrity.   Specifically, we recommended that
HCFA:<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Establish an integrated financial management system at the contractors to promote
consistency and reliability in recording and reporting accounts receivable information.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Establish a formal review process over accounts receivable to detect unusual fluctuations,
anomalies, and unexpected variances.<br>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
<p>Ensure that contractors develop control procedures to provide independent checks of the
validity, accuracy, and completeness of receivable amounts reported to HCFA.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Develop an independent internal oversight group or internal audit function to monitor the
contractors' compliance with HCFA reporting requirements for accounts receivable and 
verify the accuracy and completeness of information reported to the HCFA central office.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Establish procedures for contractors to periodically reconcile accounts receivable balances to
supporting documentation.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Periodically review contractors' control procedures over the accounts receivable
reconciliation process.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Consider establishing a weekly limit on the total amount of Medicare funds that can be
drawn by contractor banks.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p>Require the HCFA regional offices to periodically test bank withdrawals to ensure there are
no early withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
