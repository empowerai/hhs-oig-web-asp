<hr>

<p>Good afternoon.  I am George Grob, Deputy Inspector General for Evaluation and
Inspections, in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.  I am pleased to testify at today's hearing on the Department's responses to
our June 1998 report on the Institutional Review Board system for protecting human
subjects of medical research.
<p>Mr. Chairman, the Department has taken a number of promising steps, but few of our
recommended reforms have been enacted.
<p><strong>Our June 1998 Report on Institutional Review Boards</strong>

<p><strong>Background.</strong>  In June 1998, we released a series of reports on the Federal system for
human-subject protections centers on institutional review boards (IRBs).  This broad-based
review was initiated after a 1995 OIG study, requested by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), raised significant concerns about the adequacy of subject protections
and the IRB system.  The report focused on medical device research and found, for
example, that in one instance that an investigator had implanted 264 investigational devices
when he only had approval for 75 implants.  We found another investigator had not gotten
informed consent from the subjects and yet other instances in which changes in the informed
consent documents that IRBs had requested were not incorporated.  Another investigator
moved from the city of practice without informing the subjects of his clinical trial who to
report to after he was gone.
<p><strong>Findings.</strong>  In the broad 1998 report, we warned that the effectiveness of IRBs was in
jeopardy.  We found that the clinical research environment had changed in the 20 years
since the system was first established and the changes have had significant implications for
IRBs.  IRBs were becoming overwhelmed by their workloads, lacking necessary resources
to keep up and becoming pressured to do more in a shorter time frame and with limited
information on many trials.  They provided little training to investigators and Board
members regarding principles and practices of human subject protection.  Of particular
significance, they conducted very little oversight of clinical trials once the trials had started. 
In addition, Federal oversight of protections was limited, leaving Department with little
sense of how well IRBs were actually doing their job.
<p>These findings led us to present numerous recommendations to the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), its Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).  Brief summaries of both our findings and recommendations
from the June 1998 report are attached to this testimony.
<p><strong>A Follow-up Report</strong>

<p>Based on the continued interest in human-subject protections and a request from this
subcommittee, we recently issued a follow-up report providing an accounting of how fully
our 1998 recommendations have been enacted.  We drew on information obtained over the
past two years from Department officials and pertinent documents, data reported to us by
the NIH and FDA, and interviews with Department officials who also provided comments
on a draft of this report, many of which are reflected in the final.  Let me state that this
report is not a further examination of the adequacy of the Federal oversight of human
subject protections or of the protections themselves.  Instead, we used as a starting point our
prior recommendations and provide an accounting of how fully they have been carried out. 
Attached at the end of this testimony is a table compiling each recommendation and a brief
description of what, if any, action has taken place.
<p><strong>The Department has taken action and initiated several promising steps.</strong>

<p><strong>Increased Enforcement.</strong>  Since June 1998, both OPRR and FDA have significantly stepped
up their on-site presence at research institutions.  Between April 1997 and May 1998, OPRR
had conducted an on-site investigation at only 1 institution.  Between June 1998 and March
2000, it conducted on-site investigations at 10 institutions.  Since June 1998, OPRR also
conducted off-site investigations (document reviews) at more than 140 additional institutions. 
It found performance problems at a number of institutions it investigated and has required 7
of them to suspend some or all of their federally funded research.  Where OPRR found
weaknesses in the institutions' systems of protections, it cited institutions for substantive,
broad-based deficiencies--ones that have direct consequences on the rights and safety of
research subjects.
<p>FDA's number of routine on-site investigations of IRBs increased from 213 in Fiscal Year
1997, to 253 in FY 1998, and 336 in FY 1999.  The Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, for example, issued eight warning letters to IRBs during FY 1999, compared to zero
in FY 1998.  The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research took administrative action
against eight IRBs during FY 1998 and 1999.
<p><strong>Sentinel Effect.  </strong>OPRR's oversight activities, in particular, have drawn the attention of the
research community to issues of human-subject protections.  The reviews at prominent
medical centers, including the temporary suspension of federally funded research at 7
centers, have had a ripple effect beyond the individual institutions visited by OPRR.  Many
major medical journals and newspapers have given prominent attention to OPRR's
enforcement actions.  The adequacy of IRB oversight has been a topic at a number of
national conferences and association meetings.
<p><strong>New Organization.</strong>  In July 1999, the Secretary announced the relocation of OPRR from
NIH to the Office of the Secretary and plans to establish a new advisory committee on
protection from research risks to provide scientific and ethical guidance to the office.  These
actions, although not yet complete, have been widely publicized and are being taken to
strengthen the stature and effectiveness of OPRR in its oversight role and are indicative of
the Secretary's commitment to strengthening subject protections.
<p><strong>Other Initiatives.</strong>  The Department has enacted two of our recommendations--as of October
1998, FDA now informs sponsors and IRBs associated with an investigator when FDA finds
evidence of misconduct on the part of clinical investigator; and in June 1999, NIH issued a
policy stating that all data and safety monitoring boards associated with NIH trials are
expected to forward summary reports of adverse events to IRBs.  Both actions are
significant.  For example, the summary information is key to an IRB's ability to ensure the
continued safety of subjects.  Both agencies have also increased their education outreach and
resources.  They have ongoing deliberations on additional proposed changes.
<p><strong>But overall, few of our recommended reforms have been enacted.</strong>

<p>Despite these positive steps, there are still need for additional reforms.  What follows is a
brief description of any the Department actions taken in response to our six broad
recommendations.  A table attached to this testimony provides a quick snapshot on the status
of the Department responses.
<p><strong>Flexibility and Accountability</strong>

<p>We called for the Department to lessen specific procedural requirements that add
questionable of value and to require that IRBs undergo regular performance-focused
evaluations.  Beyond one concrete action discussed below, there have been few enacted
reforms along the lines we recommended.  Little has been done to grant IRBs more
flexibility or to establish a Federal basis for assessing the effectiveness of
IRBs.
<p>In November 1998, FDA and NIH/OPRR jointly issued new regulation expanding the
categories of research that may be reviewed by IRBs through an expedited review
procedure.  There are also active deliberations by an NIH Advisory Group geared towards
reducing regulatory burden and streamlining processes for grantee institutions.  Among its
recommendations, the group proposed a change, about to be implemented, to the
requirement that IRBs review all protocols before funding decisions are made, an
improvement we suggested.
<p>The most notable development around IRB performance evaluations is in the private sector. 
A private group devoted to the ethical conduct of research, is working to develop
performance standards and apply them as part of an accreditation process.  Both NIH/OPRR
and FDA are participating in these discussions.
<p><strong>Oversight of Ongoing Research</strong>

<p>We made several recommendations to strengthen continuing protections of clinical research
subjects after the research has begun.  For example, we called for more explicit policies on
when and how data safety and monitoring boards could be used in certain research trials and
a suggested a requirement that they share summary information with IRBs.  We also called
for FDA to inform IRBs when it takes action against an investigator under the IRB's
purview and to establish a requirement that sponsors and investigators notify IRBs of any
prior IRB review of research.  Finally, we called for increased IRB awareness of on-site
research practices.
<p>As stated earlier, FDA now informs sponsors and IRBs about investigator misconduct and
NIH issued a policy requiring its data and safety monitoring boards (DSMBs) to forward
summary information to IRBs.  But, neither NIH nor FDA has issued requirements for
sponsors to notify IRBs of prior reviews, nor have they issued guidance to IRBs to increase
their attention to on-site research practices.  FDA has not set forth regulations regarding the
appropriate use for or composition of DSMBs, which can help provide and assemble
valuable information for IRBs.
<p>FDA requires all sponsors of gene transfer research, and sponsors overseen by the  Center
for Devices and Radiological Health, to routinely submit monitoring plans.  But both of
these policies do not address a large majority of clinical trials.  We urge FDA and NIH take
similar initiatives directed at other research areas.
<p><strong>Education and Training</strong>	

<p>We called for the Department to require institutions receiving Public Health Service Act
funds establish an education program for investigators and that IRBs be required to educate
their members.  No Federal regulations have been enacted requiring institutions to establish
education programs for clinical investigators.  Similarly, no Federal requirements have been
enacted calling for education for IRB members.
<p>NIH intramural researchers are required to complete a web-based tutorial in order to
conduct human-subjects research on campus.  We urge NIH to consider expanding this
policy to all extramural researchers, who conduct the majority of research funded by NIH. 
Both NIH and FDA have increased their educational outreach through numerous training
presentations and seminars for IRBs and professional groups.  NIH has constructed a
website containing bioethics resources and has launched new training grants in subject
protection issues and bioethics.  FDA is in the process of updating its Information Sheets, an
important source of IRB guidance.  NIH/OPRR hired a full-time educational staff person in
January 1999, and is in the process of further expanding this staff.
<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong>

<p>We called for a number of steps to mitigate the potential influence of conflicts on IRB
reviews such as a requirement increasing the number of nonscientific and noninstitutional
members on IRBs and a prohibition on equity owners of independent IRBs from
participating in the IRB review process.  We did not identify any significant action in the
Department to mitigate potential IRB conflicts of interest.  We continue to regard this as a
significant area warranting attention.  In the increasingly commercialized research
environment, potential for conflicts within research institutions loom larger than ever and it
is ever more important that IRB reviews be sufficiently independent, both in reality and in
appearance.
<p><strong>Workload Pressures</strong>	

<p>We called for OPRR to hold institutions accountable for the resource commitments they
made in their assurances and for FDA to modify its site visit protocol to more readily
identify situations in which limited resources may jeopardize subject protections.  OPRR's
enforcement efforts have brought attention to IRB resource shortages at individual
institutions.  However, no further action has been taken to develop indicators of adequate
resource levels or to enable greater investments to support IRB functions.
<p>One approach that NIH reports is under consideration, and is worthy of attention, would be
to allow institutions to allocate an additional increment of grant funds to provide necessary
resources for IRBs.  A well-supported IRB should be considered a necessary cost of doing
business.
<p><strong>Reengineering Federal Oversight</strong>

<p>We called for NIH to revamp its oversight and  assurance process and for FDA to revamp
its on-site inspection process.  We also called for the Department to require IRBs to register
before being allowed to review research under the Department jurisdiction.
<p>OPRR's and FDA's response in increasing their enforcement efforts is significant, as we
have already indicated.  By increasing their presence in research institutions, they have
fostered compliance with Federal regulations there-- and most likely at others as well.  But
neither body has yet enacted any significant revamping of their oversight processes as we
have called for.  This is unfortunate because stepped up enforcement without a more
efficient, performance-oriented enforcement process will still leave us with an oversight
system that falls well short of its potential.
<p>FDA has substantially increased its IRB inspections, but it has not engineered any significant
changes in its approach to these inspections.  The inspections remain narrow and focused on
procedural compliance, not results.  NIH/OPRR reports that it has been developing plans to
streamline the assurance process as we called for in our June 1998 report.  But no actual
change has taken place to date.
<p>It is important to note that FDA has formed a working group to establish an IRB registration
system.  The working group has agreed upon specifications for this registry that reflect
many of our suggestions.  However, nothing has been implemented yet.  We encourage the
group to follow through with this effort.
<p><strong>The Common Rule: A Significant Barrier to Departmental Progress</strong>

<p>The HHS core regulations concerning IRBs and human-subject protections are the basis of a
common Federal policy on human-subject protections.  The Federal policy, known as the
Common Rule, is adhered to by the Department and 16 other Federal agencies.
<p>Because any changes to the Rule call for the concurrence of all 17 Federal agencies,  we
must acknowledge that the reality of gaining concurrence among 17 Federal agencies
inhibits a timely and effective the Department response to a number of our
recommendations.
<p>Several of our recommendations can be carried out through administrative changes, for
example requiring education through contract and grant language or altering the assurance
or inspection processes.  However, other recommended changes, are subsumed in the
Common Rule.  A requirement, for instance, for more extensive representation on IRBs of
nonscientific and noninstitutional members or stronger requirements on IRBs having
sufficient independence, could be difficult to carry out without the agreement of the other 16
agencies.
<p>The intention of having a common Federal policy on human subject protections is an
important one.  One set of standards fosters a level of consistency in protections of human
subjects in many different areas of research and makes complying with Federal regulations 
easier for researchers and sponsors.  However, with the clinical research environment
changing rapidly, we believe it is essential for the Federal policy and regulatory actions to
keep pace.  Therefore, legislative change may be necessary to achieve a timely
implementation of many of our recommendations.
<p><strong>The Need for Action on a Broad Front</strong>

<p>Our June 1998 inquiry and continuing work in this area convinces us that IRBs alone cannot
do the job; other parties in the clinical research process, including sponsors and
investigators, must take responsibility for subject protections.  That is why, for example,
our recommendations include actions that call for investigator education.  Investigators,
while they are in a position to do the most harm to patients, are also in a position to do the
most good.  More explicit Federal guidelines on recruiting subjects and the use and
composition of data safety and monitoring boards can also help.  The National Bioethics
Advisory Commission is also likely to offer further guidance in the near future on the kind
of changes that need to be made in the Federal regulatory system.
<p><strong>New Opportunity for Leadership</strong>

<p>The Department has a significant new opportunity to exert Federal leadership in protecting
human subjects with the new office in the Office of the Secretary and a new advisory
committee on subject protection issues.  We urge that the new office give significant
attention to our prior recommendations.  We also urge that it continue the <em>important</em>
enforcement efforts undertaken by OPRR over the past 2 years.  The NIH/OPRR efforts
have served as a reminder to research institutions, sponsors, individual investigators, and
IRBs that the reviews must still be substantive in order to ensure adequate protections for
human subjects.  In the important quest to reduce regulatory burdens, it is important not to
lose sight of this underlying protection function.
<p>Both FDA and NIH will retain significant statutory and operational responsibilities for
protecting human subjects despite the impending establishment of a Departmental office for
subject protections.  FDA still has the most visible on-site presence and thus is in the best
position to identify shortcomings and opportunities for improvement.  NIH retains
significant roles in ensuring human-subject protections as a major sponsor of clinical
research and as a conduit to the research community.
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>

<p>We continue to support the recommendations we made in our earlier report and call for a
greater sense of urgency in carrying them out.  They offer actions that would strengthen
human-subject protections without impeding vital clinical research.  They reflect a respect
for the largely collegial manner in which IRBs operate.  Yet, they also recognize that
verification and accountability must also be important features of a system intended to
protect human subjects.	

<p>Our recommendations are not a complete blueprint for action.  In the months ahead, we will
be conducting further inquiry that more closely examines how the Department oversight can
enhance human-subject protections.
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this most important topic.  At this time, I would be
happy to answer any questions which you or the other members of the Subcommittee may
have.

<p align="center"><strong>FINDINGS</strong>

<strong><hr size="0">


</strong><p align="center"><strong><em>Institutional Review Boards: A Time for Reform<br>
</em>(OEI-01-97-00193), June 1998</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>The Effectiveness of IRBs Is in Jeopardy.</strong>

<p><strong>They Face Major Changes in the Research Environment.</strong>  The current framework of IRB practices was shaped
in the 1970s in an environment where research typically was carried out by a single investigator working under
government funding with a small cohort of human subjects in a university teaching hospital.  In recent years, that
environment has been changing dramatically as a result of the expansion of managed care, the increased
commercialization of research, the proliferation of multi-site trials, new types of research, the increased number of
research proposals, and the rise of patient consumerism.  Each of these developments has presented major
disruptions and challenges for IRBs.  "Never before," concluded one recent review, "has such a pressure-cooker
atmosphere prevailed within the IRB system."
<p><strong>They Review Too Much, Too Quickly, with Too Little Expertise.</strong>  This is especially apparent in many of the
larger institutions.  Expanded workloads, resource constraints, and extensive Federal mandates contribute to a
rushed atmosphere where sufficient deliberation often is not possible.  At the same time, the IRBs frequently are
hard-pressed to gain access to the scientific expertise they need to reach informed judgments about the research
taking place under their jurisdiction.
<p><strong>They Conduct Minimal Continuing Review of Approved Research.</strong>  In the environment described above,
continuing review often loses out.  Even where there is the will, there often is not the time to go beyond the
perfunctory obligations.  A lack of feedback from other entities that oversee multi-site trials contributes to the
problem.  The result is that IRBs have all too little information about how the informed consent process really
works and about how well the interests of subjects are being protected during the course of research.
<p><strong>They Face Conflicts That Threaten Their Independence.</strong>  Clinical research provides revenue and prestige to
the institutions to which many IRBs belong.  The institutions expect IRBs to support these interests at the same
time that they protect human subjects.  The resulting tension can lessen the IRBs' focus on their basic mission. 
The minimal "outside" representation that typically exists on IRBs deprives them of an important counterbalance
to the institutional interests.  For independent IRBs, the dependence on revenue from industry sponsors exerts
similar possibilities for conflict.
<p><strong>They Provide Little Training for Investigators and Board Members.  </strong>The IRB system depends heavily on
research investigators' commitment to uphold human-subject protections.  But as that system now operates, it
offers little educational outreach to investigators to help them become informed and sensitized about these
protections.  Similarly, it provides minimal orientation and continuing education for IRB members--a deficiency
that is especially detrimental to nonscientific and noninstitutional members.
<p><strong>Neither IRBs Nor The Department Devote Much Attention to Evaluating IRB Effectiveness.</strong>   IRBs rarely
conduct inquiries to determine how well they are accomplishing their mission; their judgments of effectiveness
rely mainly on the number of protection lapses or complaints that are brought to their attention.  The Department
agencies conducting oversight seldom go any further.  The Office for Protection from Research Risks, in the
National Institutes of Health, focuses almost entirely on up-front assurances.  The Food and Drug Administration
relies on compliance-focused inspections.

<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>

<strong><hr size="0">


<p align="center"><em>Institutional Review Boards: A Time for Reform<br>
</em>(OEI-01-97-00193), June 1998</strong>
<p><strong>1.  Recast Federal Requirements So That They Grant IRBs Greater Flexibility and Hold Them More
Accountable for Results.</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Eliminate or lessen specific procedural requirements that are of questionable value.</em>  Our aim was to
provide overburdened IRBs with greater discretion that would enable them to develop more innovative and
strategic approaches to their reviews.  There are requirements, for example, that limit what IRBs can
accomplish in conducting protocol reviews outside of convened board meetings.  In addition, we highlighted
requirements that call for IRBs to conduct full, annual reviews of approved protocols and that call for
complete reviews of Federal funding applications prior to funding decisions.<br>
 </li>

  <li>  <em>Require that IRBs undergo regular performance-focused evaluations that are carried out in accordance
with Federal guidelines.</em>  In our review, we were struck by how little attention Federal oversight bodies and 
IRBs themselves gave to evaluating how successful IRBs were in protecting human subjects.  It is time, we
concluded, for the Federal government to mandate self-evaluations or, better yet, evaluations conducted by
independent, outside parties.  We also urged that the results of such evaluations be made public.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>2.  Strengthen Continuing Protections for Human Subjects Participating in Research.</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Require Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) for certain high-risk and multi-site trials.</em>  DSMBs are
independent assessment bodies that provide medical, scientific and other expertise that typically is not
available on IRBs, thereby serving an invaluable function in protecting human subjects.  We recommended
that NIH and FDA take the lead in seeing that DSMBs become more firmly established as oversight
mechanisms and become more clearly accountable.<br>
 </li>

  <li>	  <em>Require DSMBs to provide summary information to IRBs.</em>  We urged that DSMBs provide their summary
assessments of adverse event reports to IRBs.  IRBs are swamped with individual adverse event reports from
multi-site trials, but these reports lack the essential context to confer meaning about the relative safety of the
trial.  DSMBs can provide this context and thereby enhance the IRB's capacity to assess ongoing safety.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Alert IRBs to corrective actions taken against investigators under the board's purview.</em>  Although FDA
provides information on its website about corrective actions that result from investigator inspections, the
Agency does not routinely inform the respective IRBs of such actions.  We recommended that FDA inform
individual IRBs when it takes corrective action against an investigator who is conducting research reviewed
by the IRB.<br>
 </li>

  <li>	  <em>Require sponsors and investigators to notify IRBs of any prior IRB review of a research plan.</em>  Sometimes
sponsors shop around for an IRB that will give their protocol a favorable review.  We pointed out that such
action can undermine the IRB review process and, accordingly, urged that this requirement be enacted.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Call for increased IRB awareness of on-site research practices involving human subjects.</em>  IRBs are rarely
aware of what actually takes place between investigator and subject.  We called for IRBs to move beyond
their focus on the informed consent document and periodically check for themselves how the actual consent
process is working.  For particularly sensitive or risky projects, we suggested they might call for the
participation of counselors, ombudsmen, or other third parties that could be available to make certain that the
consent process functions in the interest of human subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.  Enact Federal Requirements That Help Ensure That Investigators and IRB Members Are Adequately
Educated About and Sensitized to Human-Subject Protections.  </strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Require institutions to establish an education program for investigators in human-subject protections.</em> 
Such a requirement exists for research involving animal subjects.  We found the case for education
requirements no less compelling for research involving humans.  The mandatory education we called for
could be provided through media such as seminars, individual instruction, videos, or on-line tutorials.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Require investigators receiving funding under the Public Health Service Act for research involving human
subjects to provide a written attestation indicating that they will uphold Federal policies concerning human-subject protections.</em>  We recommended such an attestation as a way of heightening investigators' awareness of
their responsibilities as investigators and interest in participating in educational programs addressing human-subject protections.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Require IRBs to educate their members about human-subject protections.</em>  In order for IRBs to adequately
review research protocols to ensure human-subject protections, each board member must be educated in both
applicable Federal regulations and ethical principles.  We called for a specific mandate that IRBs and their
parent institutions provide initial and continuing education.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>4.  Help Insulate IRBs from Conflicts That Can Compromise Their Mission in Protecting Human Subjects.</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Require more extensive representation on IRBs of nonscientific and noninstitutional members.  </em>At present
just one IRB member can wear both of these hats and satisfy the requirement.  We found that to be an
untenable situation, one that can deprive IRBs of a valuable counterbalance to internal, institutional pressures
that can threaten their independence.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Reinforce to IRBs and their parent institutions the importance of IRBs maintaining sufficient independence. 
</em>It is particularly important that IRBs not report to a part of an institution responsible for bringing in research
funds.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Prohibit equity owners from participating in the IRB review process</em>.  Such a practice does not necessarily
inhibit the independence of the review process, but it establishes a situation that can undermine a perception
of impartiality.  We recommended that it should be disallowed.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>5.  Recognize the Seriousness of the Workload Pressures That Many IRBs Face and Take Actions That Aim
to Moderate Them.</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Require that IRBs have access to sufficient resources to adequately carry out their duties.</em>  Our
recommendation was directed not only to staff and board member resources, but also to space, computers, and
other essential elements.  We urged OPRR to hold institutions accountable for the resource commitments they
made in their assurances and for FDA to modify its site visit protocol so that it could more readily identify
situations where resource shortages jeopardize an IRB's ability to oversee research.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Reengineer the Federal Oversight Process</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	  <em>Revamp the NIH/OPRR assurance process.</em>  NIH/OPRR's oversight process has been concentrated on
reviewing up-front assurances aimed at obtaining an institution's commitment to adhere to Federal
requirements.  We found that assurance process to be paperwork-laden with little effect on IRB functioning. 
We urged that NIH/OPRR reorient the assurance process so that it rests on an institutional attestation to
conform to Federal requirements, and then devote more NIH/OPRR resources to periodic performance-based
reviews of institutions and their IRBs.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Revamp the FDA on-site inspection process.</em>  We recognized that FDA has a much greater on-site presence
than NIH/OPRR, but urged that FDA transform its site visit protocol from a narrow compliance orientation to
one that is much more performance-based.  Such an approach would pay particular attention to how
individuals were actually being approached about participating as human subjects and to how IRBs were
making risk-benefit trade-offs.<br>
  </li>

  <li>	  <em>Require IRBs to register with the Federal government.</em>  We found that one of the major impediments to
Federal oversight of human-subjects research is that there is no complete registry of the IRBs reviewing this
research.  Such a registry would be invaluable for FDA and NIH/OPRR as it would allow them to target their
oversight and communicate more effectively with IRBs.</li>
</ul>
