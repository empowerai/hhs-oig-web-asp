<br wp="br1"><hr>


Good Morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee.  I am Lewis Morris, Assistant
Inspector General for Legal Affairs in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS).  I am accompanied by Special Agent Steve Lack from our San
Francisco Regional Office who is familiar with many of the issues and cases I will describe today.
<p>The mission of the OIG is to identify ways to improve HHS programs and operations and protect
them against fraud, waste and abuse.  We do this by conducting independent and objective audits,
evaluations, and investigations, which provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to
Department officials, the Administration, the Congress, and the public.  In carrying out our mission,
we work with the Department and its operating divisions, the Department of Justice (DOJ), other
Federal and State agencies, and the Congress to bring about systemic improvements in HHS
programs and operations, and to prosecute and/or recover funds from those who defraud the
Government.
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today and provide the Committee with the OIG's
perspective on the issues presented by the role of third-party billing companies in the Federal health
care programs.  My testimony will provide:
<ul>
  <li>an overview of the role played by third-party billing companies;</li>
  <li>a description of OIG efforts to promote integrity among third-party billers;</li>
  <li>a look at some specific fraud investigations involving third-party billing companies;</li>
  <li>the insights the OIG has gained from these cases; and</li>
  <li>some suggestions for programmatic reforms.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Role of Third-Party Billing Companies</strong>

<p>Billing companies are becoming a vital segment of the health care industry.  Increasingly, health
care providers rely on billing companies to assist them in processing claims in accordance with
applicable statutes and regulations.  Additionally, health care providers consult with billing
companies for advice regarding reimbursement matters, as well as overall business decision-making.
<p>Billing companies provide a variety of types of services.  For example, some billing companies only
process bills that have already been coded by the provider, while others take on the added
responsibility of assigning billing codes based on the client's medical documentation.  In addition to
claims preparation, some billing companies also offer a spectrum of management services, including
accounts receivable management and bad debt collections.  Other third-party billing companies
specialize in a particular sector of the health care industry, such as physician services provided in
emergency rooms.
<p>In fiscal year 1998, the Medicare program processed over 700 million Part B claims and 149 million
Part A claims, the vast majority of which under both categories were electronic.  Even with its
enhanced program integrity functions, the Health Care Financing Administration is able to conduct
payment reviews on only 10 percent of these claims. The system must rely on the honesty and good
faith of health care providers, as well as those who process and submit claims on their behalf. 
Third-party billing companies that operate ethically can provide a great service to providers and the
Federal health care programs.  These companies can offer expertise in program reimbursement
requirements, help ensure that claims are accurately prepared, and free physicians and other
practitioners to devote their energies to the care of their patients.
<p><strong>OIG Efforts to Promote Integrity among Third-Party Billers</strong>
<p>In order to assist honest billers establish internal controls that promote adherence to Federal health
care program requirements, the OIG has taken proactive steps to promote integrity among the third-party billing industry.
<p><u>Compliance Guidance</u>.  The primary method by which the OIG has reached out to the billing
industry is through the release of the "Compliance Program Guidance for Third-Party Medical
Billing Companies," in November 1998.  Consistent with other OIG compliance guidance, the
Third-Party Billing Compliance Guidance sets forth the benefits of a compliance program, describes
the essential elements of a compliance program, discusses general compliance principles and
counsels companies on how they might use the Guidance.  Most importantly, the OIG formulated
the Guidance with the input of the third-party billing industry, as well as other interested parties.
<p>The Third-Party Billing Compliance Guidance also identifies the specific risk areas that should be
addressed by all billing companies.  Such areas include billing for items or services not actually
documented; unbundling and upcoding of claims; computer software programs that encourage
billing personnel to enter data in fields indicating services were rendered though not actually
performed or documented; knowing misuse of provider identification numbers which results in
improper billing in violation of rules governing reassignment of benefits; billing company incentives
that violate the anti-kickback statute; and percentage billing arrangements.
<p>In addition , the Guidance describes the risk areas for companies that provide coding services in
addition to billing services, including "assumption" coding (the coding of a diagnosis or procedure
without supporting clinical documentation); alteration of the documentation; coding without proper
documentation of all physician and other professional services; and billing for services provided by
unqualified or unlicenced clinical personnel.
<p>The OIG hopes that providing information and recommendations such as contained in the Guidance
will help lead third-party billing companies to voluntarily embrace corporate compliance programs
that fit their individual needs, and thus, help reduce the level of fraud, waste and abuse in Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursement.
<p><u>Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs)</u>.  Another manner in which the OIG seeks to promote
compliance in the third-party billing industry is through the imposition of CIAs on certain billing
companies involved in fraud schemes.  These agreements are imposed in global settlements in lieu
of exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs.  CIAs are imposed on companies to
help reorient a corporate culture that may have previously been prone to fraud and abuse.  In this
way, the OIG attempts to directly affect change in third-party billing entities.  Such CIAs may also
serve as admonitory examples for others within the industry.
<p>CIAs set forth specific requirements that a provider must meet in establishing a compliance program
or in maintaining an existing compliance program.  For instance, the CIAs imposed on third-party
billing companies require them to establish and maintain a compliance officer function, a code of
conduct, specific policies and procedures addressing billing and coding issues, a training program,
and annual audits and reviews.  Moreover, the companies must make annual reports to the OIG on
their efforts to comply with the CIAs.
<p><strong>Investigations of Third-Party Billing Companies</strong>

<p>Unfortunately, there are system vulnerabilities that an unethical billing company can take advantage
of and exploit for its financial gain.  The problems associated with dishonest third-party billing
companies are as old as the Medicare program itself.  As early as 1972, the Congress took action to
stop "factoring" arrangements, the practice of physicians and other providers reassigning their
Medicare and Medicaid receivables to a collection agency for a percentage of their face value.  The
agency in turn prepared and submitted the claims to the health care programs and received payment
in its name.  These reassignments were a significant source of incorrect and inflated claims.  Cases
of fraudulent billings by collections agencies and payment of substantial overpayments to these
"factoring" agencies were also found.  In response, Congress prohibited, with limited exceptions,
payment for covered services to anyone other than the patient or the person who provided the
service.
<p>Despite the effort to stop factoring of Medicare and Medicaid bills, some individuals and billing
companies circumvented the intent of the law by the use of a power of attorney, allowing the billing
company to receive Federal health care payments in the name of the provider, thus continuing the
abuses associated with reassignment of claims.  In 1977, the Congress responded by precluding the
use of a power of attorney as a device for reassignment of benefits.  However, a billing agency could
continue collecting Medicare or Medicaid payments on behalf of a health care provider, provided
that the agency does so pursuant to an agreement under which the compensation paid to the agency
for its services is unrelated to the dollar amount of the billings or payments, and is not dependent
upon the actual collection of any such payments.
<p>These Congressional efforts to curb program abuses continue to be thwarted by unethical billing
companies.  While the OIG cannot discuss any ongoing investigations, the following cases show
how easily a dishonest third-party billing company can establish a scheme that generates millions in
fraudulent claims.
<p><u>Physicians on Call</u>.  During the 1980's, the OIG investigated allegations that a billing company
called "Physicians on Call" used recent medical school graduates to perpetrate a fraudulent billing
scheme.  The company hired doctors, obtained Medicare providers numbers in their names, and then
contracted with nursing homes for the provision of monthly physician visits to perform examinations
of the residents.  Although these monthly examinations generally were brief, the billing company
upcoded the physician's visits to reflect extensive, and more highly reimbursed, services.  This
fraudulent upcoding was done without the knowledge of the doctors, who received payment from
the company based on the services actually rendered.  The scheme was uncovered by the Medicare
contractor during a routine review of claims for physician services.  As the named providers of
service on the Medicare claims, the physicians were assessed overpayments.  They were not able to
seek relief from Physicians on Call because it had gone out of business.
<p><u>Handle With Care, Inc.</u>  A criminal investigation from the early 1990's provides another example of
how vulnerable the Federal health care programs are to the schemes of dishonest billing companies. 
In this case, two sisters,  Kristina Brambila and Wendy Desalvo, set up a third-party billing company
known as Handle With Care, Inc. (HWC) to perform "lost charge" audits for nursing homes.  The
two sisters persuaded at least 70 nursing homes in 8 states that they would  review residents'
medical records and accounts for services that had not been billed to Medicare.  Using "tricks of the
trade" known only to HWC, the company billed Medicare on behalf of the nursing home for these
overlooked charges and kept 50 percent of the proceeds.  In actuality, HWC billed for surgical
dressings for nursing home patients who had not had surgery and fraudulently caused  Medicare to
pay approximately $7.4 million for nonrendered services.
<p>Because the billing company submitted the fraudulent claims under the nursing home's provider
number, it took OIG investigators a great deal of time and resources to tie what appeared to be
unrelated improper billings by different nursing homes back to a single third-party billing company. 
At the conclusion of the investigation, the two sisters were convicted of Medicare fraud and received
prison sentences.  Additionally, the Government reached False Claims Act (FCA) settlements with
15 of the involved nursing homes and recovered over $5 million cumulatively.
<p><u>Medaphis Corporation</u>.  While some third-party billing schemes involve a small group of
individuals, they can also involve some of the largest billing agencies.  For example, in 1998, the
United States investigated allegations brought by a whistle blower that the national third-party
medical billing companies, Medaphis and Medaphis Physician Services (Medaphis), was submitting
duplicate claims and using incorrect codes on claims submitted on behalf of a client.  During the
period of 1992 through 1996, a Medaphis subsidiary was alleged to have improperly submitted
multiple claims for payment for the same service to the same patient on the same date of service;
used incorrect or inapplicable diagnosis codes in resubmitting claims which had been denied based
on the diagnosis originally stated; and submitted other improper radiology and cardiology-related
claims.  Medaphis agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve its civil liability and entered into an
extensive five year corporate integrity agreement (CIA) that covers its activities throughout the
nation.
<p><u>Gottlieb Financial Services, Inc.</u>  In 1999, the United States resolved allegations against another
wholly-owned subsidiary of Medaphis Physician Services, Gottlieb Financial Services, Inc. (GFS),
that provided emergency department physician billing services.  When preparing claims for
evaluation and management services, GFS allegedly used an automated coding software system that
routinely upcoded emergency room visits.  In this instance, based on an inability to pay more,
Medaphis agreed to pay $15 million to settle its liability, $2.4 million of which went to the
whistleblower who brought the case under the <em>qui tam</em> provisions of the FCA.  Moreover, the
Medaphis CIA imposed as part of the earlier settlement was made part of this new settlement,
given
that GFS's conducted pre-dated the execution of the prior CIA.
<p><u>Professional Medical Billers d/b/a Professional Radiology Billers.</u>  Yet another example of the
Medicare program's vulnerability to third-party billing fraud can be found in a recently prosecuted
criminal case.  Professional Medical Billers d/b/a Professional Radiology Billers (PRB) provided
third-party billing services primarily to physicians.  From 1994 through 1996, PRB added fabricated
services to the physician claims and then submitted the claims to Federal health care programs under
the physicians' provider number.  PRB would reimburse the physicians for the legitimate claims
(less PRB's percentage for providing billing services) and keep all the payments for the fabricated
services.  The scheme was uncovered when one of the company's clients learned that his year-to-date earning from Medicare were double the amount that had been deposited into his bank account
by the billing service.
<p>Nancy Thetford and Tracey Huff, co-owners of PRB, pled guilty to criminal charges and
acknowledged that the scheme cost Medicare and Medicaid over $1 million.  Thetford was
sentenced to 5 years supervised probation and was excluded from Federal health care programs for
10 years.  Huff was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment and is also subject to mandatory
exclusion.  The company ceased to operate in the course of the investigation and is now defunct.
<p><u>Emergency Physician Billing Services, Inc.</u>  Perhaps the most alarming example of the systematic
abuse of the Federal health care programs by a third-party billing company can be found in the
recent case of Emergency Physician Billing Services, Inc. (EPBS).  At the time of the investigation,
EPBS provided coding, billing, and collections services for emergency physician groups in over 100
emergency departments in as many as 33 states.   Based upon allegations presented by a <em>qui tam</em>
relator, the United States charged that EPBS and its principle owner, Dr. J.D. McKean, routinely
billed Federal and state health care programs for higher level of treatment than was provided or
supported by medical record documentation.
<p>EPBS was paid based on a percentage of revenues either billed or recovered, depending on the
client.  EPBS coders received a base pay with bonuses based on the number of charts processed and
were required  to process 40 emergency room medical charts per hour, or the equivalent of a chart
every 90 seconds.  By contrast, a competitor of EPBS requires 120 charts per day.  The EPBS coders
were able to meet these quotas by taking short-cuts and disregarding information in the chart.  As
the trial court noted, no coder at EPBS ever attended training or any other informational meeting
regarding emergency department coding other than in-house EPBS training and no coder ever
contacted a physician with questions regarding a chart.
<p>After a trial in which the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma found
EPBS and Dr. McKean liable under the FCA, the defendants agreed to pay $15.5 million to resolve
their civil and administrative monetary liabilities.  In addition, Dr. McKean agreed to be excluded
from participation in the Federal health care programs for 15 years and EPBS entered into a
comprehensive CIA.  Currently, the Government is pursuing physician groups that benefitted from
EPBS's fraudulent practices.	

<p><strong>Insights Gained from these Investigations</strong>

<p>These investigations, as well as program evaluations by the OIG and GAO, highlight the Federal
health care program's potential vulnerability to fraud by unscrupulous third-party billing companies. 
The insights gained from the investigations include:
<ul>
  <li>payment incentives such as percentage compensation arrangements can encourage abuse; </li>
  <li>there is a loophole in the prohibition on reassignment rule; </li>
  <li>training of billers and coders may be inadequate;</li>
  <li>the ability to identify and track third-party billers is limited at best; and </li>
  <li>standards for participation (certifications, qualifications or conditions) to act as billing agents
for Federal health care programs are non-existent.  </li>
</ul>

<p><u>Payment incentives can encourage abuse</u>.  There can be little doubt that payment arrangements
where billing companies are reimbursed on a percentage basis create an environment ripe for abuse. 
The temptation to upcode or fabricate additional services may be irresistible when the billing
company's compensation depends upon the amount of revenue generated or claims submitted.  For
instance, EPBS was paid by its physician clients based on a percentage of revenues, and in turn
EPBS paid its coders a base salary with bonuses based on the number of charts coded.  Such
payment incentives discouraged coders from  paying close attention to the adequacy of
documentation in charts to support the claim to Medicare.
<p>Improper incentives appear to have been a factor in several of the cases discussed above. Although
we are not certain of the pervasiveness of these types of arrangements, our suspicion is that it
characterizes many third-party billing arrangements.
<p><u>Loophole in prohibition on reassignment rules</u>.  Although not addressed specifically by the court in
the EPBS case, the Government determined that the manner in which EPBS was compensated by its
clients undermined Medicare policy on reassignment.  As a general matter, Medicare prohibits the
reassignment of the right to payment to persons other than the provider or supplier who delivered the
service.  However, as an exception to this general rule, payment may be made to an agent who
furnishes billing and collection services to the health care provider if certain conditions are satisfied. 
Among the conditions to be eligible for the reassignment, the agent's compensation may not be
related to the dollar amounts billed or collected.  In other words, Medicare will only pay a third
party biller on behalf of its clients when the agent has no financial interest in how much is billed or
collected.
<p>Unfortunately, it appears that some billing companies have constructed payment arrangements that
circumvent the intent of the Medicare rule.  Rather than comply with the prohibition on incentive
payments, billing companies arrange for the Medicare payments to be made to the client for deposit
in a bank account in the client's name, usually at the same financial institution where the billing
company maintains an account.   The money is typically held in the client's account for twenty-four
hours or less, after which the Medicare funds from the individual provider client account are swept
into the billing company's general bank account.  There often is an agreement between the client and
the biller that the former will not remove any funds during the initial twenty-four hour period.  Then
the billing company remits to the client's account the reimbursement to which the client is entitled,
minus its percentage-based billing fee.  And in the case of dishonest billing companies, they also
withhold the proceeds from fabricated, upcoded or other improper claims submitted in the name of
the client.  Under this "lockbox" arrangement, as it is often called, the prohibition on reassignment
of claims to an incentive compensated billing agent does not apply because the payment is made
directly to the physician and not the agent.
<p><u>Training may be inadequate</u>.  The OIG is not aware of any studies examining the quality and extent
of training provided by billing companies to their personnel.  However, certain facts are clear.  First,
the Medicare program does not mandate that billing companies ensure that their personnel meet
minimal training requirements.  While there are certain private organizations that train and certify
coders and Medicare contractors can provide certain coding and billing training, such certifications
and outside training are not required by Medicare.  Moreover, it is the OIG's understanding that to
the extent that Medicare contractors issue educational guidance on billing and coding issues, such
guidance is only sent to providers and not to billing companies.
<p>Third-party billing companies that choose to abuse the Medicare program can take advantage of
these system weaknesses.  For example, EPBS did not send its coders to any training or any other
informational meeting regarding emergency department coding other than in-house EPBS training. 
Such in-house training was highly problematic as it was based on an internal coding manual created
by Dr. McKean and did not incorporate the CPT manual, the primary tool used by Medicare to
determine appropriate billing codes.		

<p><u>Ability to Identify third-party billers is limited</u>.  There are approximately 5,000 third-party billers in
the United States.  However, the OIG has just issued a report<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on computerized billing systems that
incidently raised the issue that HCFA's ability to identify these companies is limited.  Likewise, it is
unknown how many of the approximately 700 million claims per year processed by Medicare are
submitted by third-party billers.  One reason for this uncertainty is that many billing agencies submit
claims to Medicare using billing and submitter numbers (unique numbers assigned to billers and
providers by HCFA for electronic claim submission) of the providers for whom they bill.  As the
case of Handled with Care, Inc. demonstrates, a scam artist can hide behind the identification
numbers of a legitimate health care provider and evade detection.  Even if the billing company uses
its own submitter number, the electronic claims often are passed through clearinghouses that
reformat the claims and then submit them to Medicare.  Under this situation, the initial third-party
billing number may no longer appear on the claim.
<p><u>Standards for participation are non-existent</u>.  Given the inability to adequately identify who is doing
third-party billing, assessing the qualifications of these companies or their personnel is almost
impossible.  Currently, the Medicare program lacks any standards or eligibility criteria for allowing
third-party billing companies to prepare and submit claims to the program.
<p>The magnitude of this vulnerability is highlighted by a recent advertisement for a "step-by-step"
business guide for medical claims processing services found in a complementary airline magazine. 
For a mere $69 dollars, "How to Start a Medical Claims Processing Service" promises that your
"prescription for a healthy income" involves no more than owning a computer, printer, modem and
claims processing software.  As the ad also notes:  "There's no training needed and . . . with health
care reform, the need for processors (and the profits to be made) will only increase."  In short,
without any type of certification process or minimal standards for third-party billers, Federal health
care programs shall remain vulnerable.		

<p><strong>Suggestions for Reform</strong>		

<p>Based on its experience to date with third-party billing in the Federal health care programs, the OIG
has formulated some tentative suggestions for reform measures.
<p>First, those who administer the Federal health care programs need an effective mechanism to
identify third-party billers when they participate in Federal health care programs.  This identification
system should allow the programs to track billing companies' overall billing patterns, to link
specific claims with particular billers, and to require claims be submitted only from authorized sites. 
This may involve registering third-party billers and clearinghouses so as to provide an audit trail and
ensure that claims enter the Medicare system from authorized sources.
<p>Second, Congress should consider measures to expressly prohibit the use of payment incentives in
third-party billing contracts, no matter how the arrangement is structured.   In other words, the
"lockbox loophole" should be closed.
<p>Third, mandated minimal training as part of qualification standards may be a way to discourage
unscrupulous and ill-informed billers from gaining access to Federal health care programs and to
ensure high quality participation by honest billers who do participate.  In the interim, we believe
contractor education efforts should be provided directly to billing companies rather than indirectly
through providers.
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to share the views of the Office of Inspector General on this important
subject.  Special Agent Steve Lack and I welcome your questions.
