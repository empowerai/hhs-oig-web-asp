<br>


Pursuant to our discussions with Budget Committee staff, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of
the Department of Health and Human Services offers the following thoughts on identifying improper
payments and fraud in the Medicare program.  This statement focuses on the development and
purpose of the annual Medicare fee-for-service error rate and describes the numerous methods we
use to detect fraud and some of the results we have achieved in our continuing fight against fraud,
waste, and abuse.
<p>First, we would like to express our belief that the vast majority of health care providers are honest in
their dealings with Medicare.  When we talk about fraud, we are not talking about providers who
make innocent billing errors, but rather those who intentionally set out to defraud the Medicare
program or abuse Medicare beneficiaries.  The importance of our ongoing work is not only to
protect the taxpayers and ensure quality healthcare for Medicare beneficiaries but also to make the
Medicare environment one in which honest providers can operate on a level playing field and do not
find themselves in unfair competition with criminals.
<p>At the same time, we are concerned about all errors, even those that are totally innocent.  The
complexity of the Medicare program places an obligation on health care providers, beneficiaries,
fiscal intermediaries, carriers, and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to take
reasonable care to comply with its rules.  Thus, our audits and studies are also intended to identify
vulnerabilities to administrative errors and to the related dollar losses, which can be quite
significant.
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
<p>The HCFA is the single largest purchaser of health care in the world.  With expenditures of
approximately $316 billion, assets of $212 billion, and liabilities of $39 billion, HCFA is also the
largest component of the Department.  In 1999, Medicare and Medicaid outlays represented 33.7
cents of every dollar of health care spent in the United States.  In view of Medicare's 39.5 million
beneficiaries, 870 million claims processed and paid annually, complex reimbursement rules, and
decentralized operations, the program is inherently at high risk for payment errors and fraudulent
schemes.
<p>Like other insurers, Medicare makes payments based on a standard claim form.  Providers typically
bill Medicare using standard procedure codes without submitting detailed supporting medical
records.  However, regulations specifically require providers to retain supporting documentation and
to make it available upon request.
<p>The OIG is statutorily charged with protecting the integrity of our Department's programs, as well
as promoting their economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.  The OIG meets this mandate through a
comprehensive program of audits, program evaluations, and investigations designed to improve the
management of the Department; to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse; and to ensure that
beneficiaries receive high-quality, necessary services at appropriate payment levels.  As part of this
effort, we conduct annual audits of the Department's and HCFA's financial statements, as required
by the Chief Financial Officers Act, as amended by the Government Management Reform Act of
1994.
<p><strong>ANNUAL ESTIMATE OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS </strong>
<p>One objective of a financial statement audit is to determine whether there are material instances of
noncompliance with laws and regulations.  To that end, for the Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 financial
statement audit period, we developed the first methodology to measure noncompliance in the
Medicare fee-for-service program, which included reviewing supporting medical records.  This work
resulted in the first-ever, statistically valid, national rate of improper Medicare payments.  At
HCFA's request, we have continued these reviews because of the high risk of Medicare payment
errors and the huge dollar impact on the financial statements.
<p>This past year, we completed our fourth annual review, covering FY 1999, of the extent of fee-for-service payments that did not comply with laws and regulations.  Our primary objective each year
has been to determine whether Medicare benefit payments were made in accordance with Title
XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) and implementing regulations.  Specifically, we
examine whether services were (1) furnished by certified Medicare providers to eligible
beneficiaries; (2) reimbursed by HCFA's Medicare contractors in accordance with Medicare laws
and regulations; and (3) medically necessary, accurately coded, and sufficiently supported in the
beneficiaries' medical records.  Our objective is not to determine the extent of fraud in the Medicare
program.
<p><strong><em>Methodology</em>

</strong>
<p>To accomplish our objective, we begin with a statistically valid sample.  For FY 1999, our
multistage, stratified sample design resulted in a sample of 600 beneficiaries with 5,223 claims
valued at $5.4 million.  For each selected beneficiary, we review all claims processed for payment. 
We first contact each provider in our sample by letter requesting copies of all medical records
supporting services billed.  In the event that we do not receive a response, we make numerous
follow-up contacts by letter, telephone calls, and/or onsite visits.  Then medical review staff from
the Medicare contractors (fiscal intermediaries and carriers) and peer review organizations assess the
medical records to determine whether the services billed were reasonable, adequately supported,
medically necessary, and coded in accordance with Medicare reimbursement rules and regulations.
<p>Concurrent with the medical reviews, we make additional detailed claim reviews to determine
whether (1) the contractor paid, recorded, and reported the claim correctly; (2) the beneficiary and
the provider met all Medicare eligibility requirements; (3) the contractor did not make duplicate
payments or payments for which another primary insurer should have been responsible under
Medicare secondary payer requirements; and (4) all services were subjected to applicable deductible
and co-insurance amounts and were priced in accordance with payment regulations.
<p><strong><em>Results in Brief</em></strong>

<p>These audit procedures have enabled us to determine the extent of sampled claims that did not
comply with Medicare laws and regulations.  By projecting the sample results, we have estimated an
annual national error rate.  In FY 1999, for instance, net payment errors totaled an estimated     
$13.5 billion, or about 7.97 percent of total Medicare fee-for-service benefit payments.  As in past
years, the payment errors could range from inadvertent mistakes to abuse or outright fraud, such as
phony records or kickbacks.  We cannot quantify what portion of the error rate is attributable to
fraud.
<p>Our historical analysis of payment errors from FY 1996 through FY 1999 identified four major error
categories:  unsupported services, medically unnecessary services, incorrect coding, and noncovered
services and miscellaneous errors.  Where appropriate, we also identified specific trends by the types
of health care providers whose claims were erroneous.  For example, this past year's estimated
$5.5 billion in unsupported services was largely attributable to home health agencies ($1.7 billion),
durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers ($1.6 billion), and physicians ($1.1 billion).
<p>When the sampled claims were submitted for payment to Medicare contractors, they contained no
visible errors.  It should be noted that the contractors' claim processing controls were generally
adequate for (1) ensuring beneficiary and provider Medicare eligibility, (2) pricing claims based on
information submitted, and (3) ensuring that the services as billed were allowable under Medicare
rules and regulations.  However, their controls were not effective in detecting the types of errors we
found.  Instead, reviews of patient records by medical professionals detected 92 percent of the
improper payments.
<p>Summing up, our error rate methodology enables us to quantify, with statistical certainty, the extent
of improper payments and to clearly see the pervasiveness of these improper payments across the
various types of Medicare services.  The methodology also identifies the types of errors and the
types of providers accountable for these errors.  More importantly, it provides a performance
measure for HCFA's use in reducing improper payments.  We have seen significant progress in this
area; the FY 1999 $13.5 billion estimate represents a 42 percent reduction since the FY 1996
estimate of $23.2 billion.
<p><strong><em>Using the Error Rate Process as an Internal Control</em></strong>

<p>The HCFA subsequently incorporated the error rate process as part of its internal control structure. 
It intends to further expand the scope of this technique through two processes: Comprehensive Error
Rate Testing (CERT) and the surveillance portion of the Payment Error Prevention Program (PEPP). 
The PEPP is designed to produce an error rate on inpatient hospital services, and CERT, while
similar to the current methodology, provides more detail on error causes at specific Medicare
contractors.
<p>The current error rate process has been endorsed by the General Accounting Office (GAO) for
several years and is consistent with its report, "Increased Attention Needed to Prevent Billions in
Improper Payments" (GAO/AIMD-00-10), calling for agencies to establish processes to determine
compliance with laws and regulations.  The GAO states that "cost-effective internal controls should
be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention of or prompt detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency's assets."  We concur with GAO and
believe that HCFA's current and proposed error rate processes will do exactly that.
<p><strong><em>Expanding the Error Rate Methodology to Measure Fraud</em>

</strong>
<p>With respect to incorporating into the error rate methodology the additional techniques being
discussed at this hearing, we believe that beneficiary interviews and provider profiling are
appropriate tools in certain circumstances.  While medical reviews clearly were the primary
identifier of improper payments in all 4 years' error rate samples, we also conducted beneficiary
and/or caregiver interviews concerning services billed by high-risk providers.  For example, we
contacted beneficiaries who had received home health services to determine whether they were, in
fact, homebound -- a requirement for Medicare reimbursement of these services.  In FY 1996, when
problems in meeting this requirement were more prevalent, beneficiary and caregiver visits were
quite valuable in establishing whether beneficiaries were homebound.  However, when errors shifted
in the following years to problems with beneficiaries' plans of care, these types of contacts had
limited value in determining improper payments.
<p>This observation is shared by Medicare contractor fraud control units, which find that beneficiary
interviews generally are not a valuable resource for detecting fraud.  According to fraud control
officials, beneficiaries (like any other patients) do not always remember what services were
rendered, do not understand the usual/customary charges associated with surgeries, or do not
recognize the scope of certain therapy services.  Recalling specific details of time spent or services
performed by the physician during an office visit 6 or 8 months ago would be a major challenge for
anybody, with often questionable results.  We therefore believe that beneficiary contacts should be
used on a case-by-case basis for selected high-risk Medicare services.  For instance, because of the
high risk of abusive billing practices by DME providers, we are expanding our ongoing FY 2000
error rate methodology to include contacts with beneficiaries who received DME services.
<p>On the other hand, the fraud control units we contacted found provider profiling an excellent
technique for identifying fraud.  This technique highlights irregular billing patterns and other
anomalies so that a provider's claims can be targeted for more detailed review of medical records. 
We, too, apply this technique, not as part of our error rate methodology but in in-depth reviews of
individual providers.  These reviews often follow our multi-State reviews used to develop a
"national" error rate for specific provider types or services.  Through individual provider audits, we
can identify patterns of misconduct or multiple questionable actions that may be referred for
investigation.  It is interesting to note that a review at one provider often takes as many, if not more,
resources than a multi-State error rate review.
<p>We do not devote investigative resources to cases unless we have a proper predication, such as a
particularly egregious situation or a strongly suspected pattern of abuse based on a sample.  For
example, in the current error rate process, if we find a claim for services that were not performed, we
cannot conclude that there is a pattern of abuse or fraud.  If we were to expand the audit scope as
suggested by GAO, we would have to review a significant number of additional provider claims to
establish such a pattern.  In addition, substantial evidence must be developed before an investigation
can be initiated.  For instance, to obtain a search warrant, both the U.S. Attorney and the Federal
magistrate must be convinced that there is probable cause, based on the evidence, that a crime has
occurred.  Thus, determining fraud is extremely time-consuming, often taking several years and
thousands of staff-hours to prove intentional deception or misrepresentation on the part of just one
provider.  Additionally, expanding the current error rate methodology in an attempt to determine
actual or potential fraud would go substantially beyond what is expected in a normal internal control
process, and it is unclear whether cost-effective corrective actions could be developed to preclude
the types of schemes discussed below.
<p><strong>FRAUD DETECTION</strong>

<p><strong><em></em></strong>As we have stated, the error rate methodology does not detect fraud, such as kickbacks, deliberate
forgery of bills or supporting documents, or violations of the Stark law regarding the financial
relationship between an entity and a physician or an immediate family member.  To fulfill this
function of our legislative mandate, we look to sources and techniques outside the error rate process. 
And we know from our investigations and from complaints we receive that waste, fraud, and abuse
are still pervasive in the health care sector.  We are therefore continuing to watch all areas of
Medicare through our audits, inspections, and investigations, as well as to encourage and receive
support from industry and beneficiary groups in our efforts.
<p>Before we describe these efforts, it may be useful to define what we mean by "fraud."  The
Government's primary enforcement tool, the civil False Claims Act, covers only offenses that are
committed with <em>actual knowledge</em> of the falsity of the claim, <em>reckless disregard</em> of the truth or falsity
of the claim, or <em>deliberate ignorance</em> of the truth or falsity of the claim.  The other major civil
remedy available to the Government, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, has the same standard of
proof.  Neither statute covers mistakes, errors, misunderstanding of the rules, or negligence, and we
are very mindful of the difference between innocent errors ("erroneous claims") and reckless or
intentional conduct ("fraudulent claims").
<p>To actually determine fraud, we typically obtain information through a combination of investigative
techniques tailored to each case.  These tools include subpoenas of medical and billing records, use
of search warrants, investigative interviews of provider employees, surveillance, and undercover
operations.  For example, establishing that a claim is tainted by an illegal kickback often requires an
analysis of contracts in the context of safe harbors as well as a review of the provider's Medicare
and private billings over time.  Once this information is gathered, it is presented to a U.S. Attorney
whose office will evaluate the information and, with input from the OIG, make a final decision on
whether the conduct constitutes criminal or civil fraud.  If the evidence demonstrates an intentional
violation of the law, the U.S. Attorney may opt to present the case to a Federal grand jury for
potential criminal action.  If no criminal intent can be shown, but there is evidence of provider
knowledge that false claims were submitted, a civil False Claims Act case may be authorized.
<p>Now let us describe the sources and techniques that we use to detect and combat fraud, along with
some related accomplishments.
<p><strong><em>Allegations of Wrongdoing</em></strong>
<p>The OIG receives allegations of wrongdoing from a number of sources, including beneficiaries, ex-employees of providers, competitors, contractors, and Qui Tam complaints.  Each of these
allegations is taken seriously and is evaluated as quickly and thoroughly as possible.  Because Qui
Tams are based on insider information, they have proved most useful in terms of identifying large-
dollar vulnerabilities.  In fact, since Calendar Year 1996, we have received 1,074 Qui Tam
allegations, of which over 300 are under active investigation.
<p>For example, one case that began with a Qui Tam complaint centered on misconduct engaged in by
National Medical Care, a nationwide dialysis company, and various of its subsidiaries before a 1996
merger with Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., the Nation's largest provider of kidney dialysis
products and services.  The Government recently reached a record-breaking Medicare fraud
settlement with Fresenius.  As a result of a joint investigation by OIG and multiple law enforcement
agencies, the company agreed to a global resolution under which three subsidiaries pled guilty, and
it agreed to pay $486 million to resolve the criminal and civil aspects of the case.  As part of the
civil settlement agreement on credit balances, the company paid directly to HCFA $11 million for
overpayments that were previously reported to the fiscal intermediaries but never recouped.  The
alleged criminal misconduct involved illegal kickback activity, submission of false claims for
dialysis-related nutrition therapy services, improper billing for laboratory services, and false
reporting of credit balances.  As part of the settlement, the company also entered into the most
comprehensive corporate integrity agreement ever imposed by OIG.
<p><strong><em>Medicare Contractor Fraud Control Units</em>

</strong>
<p>Medicare contractor fraud control units, which are a required part of the Medicare claim processing
contractors' operations, are used in the effort to prevent, detect, and deter Medicare fraud and abuse.
They employ a number of techniques, including sampling claims to determine propriety of
payments, contacting beneficiaries to verify delivery of services, reviewing DME certificates of
medical necessity, analyzing high-cost procedures and items, and analyzing local billing trends
against national and regional trends for the top 30 national procedures.  Unusual trends are targeted
for focused medical review.  Potential fraud is also identified by researching complaints and
referrals received from beneficiaries, providers, and industry insiders and through various data
analysis techniques.  One proactive technique profiles providers using special software designed to
highlight irregular billing patterns and other anomalies to target a provider's claims for more
detailed review.
<p>If fraud is indicated, the fraud control units refer cases to the OIG and other law enforcement
authorities for consideration of civil or criminal prosecution and application of administrative
sanctions.  Over a third of the more than 1,600 referrals in FYs 1998 and 1999 were developed using 
proactive techniques.
<p><em><strong>Audits and Evaluations</strong></em>

<p>Many of our leads on potential fraud are developed through audits and evaluations of various aspects
of the Medicare program, most often on a provider-by-provider basis.  Some significant examples
are summarized below:
<ul>
  <li>
<p><em><strong>Home Health Care</strong></em>.  Looking behind the explosive growth in Medicare expenditures for
home health care since 1990, OIG, using claim data from 1995 through part of 1996, found
that 40 percent of the payments were improper.  We also determined that many home health
agencies shared characteristics that could undermine the Department's ability to recover
overpayments or levy sanctions.  Our recommendations to strengthen the Medicare
certification process and to otherwise protect the trust fund were adopted in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.  Conducted at the Department's request, our follow-up work, which
examined 1998 claim data, noted that the payment error rate had fallen to 19 percent.
<p>	Additional reviews at individual home health agencies have led to 420 investigations of
potential fraud since October 1997, and 130 of these investigations are ongoing.  A
particularly egregious case of misappropriated Medicare funds and potential abuse of
Medicare patients was noted at St. John's Home Health Agency, the highest paid home
health agency in South Florida.  We found that St. John's billed Medicare for nonrendered or
upcoded home health services, that nurses and home health aides permitted subcontracting
groups to use their names and/or create fraudulent documents to support nonrendered
services, and that some nursing visits were provided by unlicensed persons.  Further,
subcontractors paid kickbacks to St. John's employees in order to do business with them.  In
December 1999, 26 people were indicted for racketeering, conspiring to racketeer, conspiring
to launder money, and conspiring to submit false claims to the Medicare program. 
Subsequent to plea or trial, there were 24 guilty verdicts (1 individual became a fugitive and
1 was acquitted); all 24 of those found guilty are in the process of being excluded from
Federal health care programs.
<p>	<br wp="br2">
  <li>
<p><strong><em>Durable Medical Equipment.  </em></strong>After sampling 36 new durable medical equipment applicants
in the Miami, Florida, area, HCFA reported in 1996 that 32 were not bona fide businesses. 
Among other problems, some bogus applicants did not have a physical address or an
inventory of DME.  According to HCFA, those companies should not have been issued a
supplier number because they were not operational entities.  To determine the prevalence of
this problem, we sampled suppliers and applicants in 12 large metropolitan areas in New
York, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and California at HCFA's request.  Our inspection found that
1 of every 14 suppliers and 1 of every 9 new applicants did not have a required physical
address.  When we checked questionable addresses, we usually found that the business had
closed or had a questionable presence at the address.  Some addresses were merely mail drop
locations or were nonexistent or could not be located.  These types of problems with physical
addresses often indicate potentially illegitimate business arrangements.
<p>	A classic example is a case we uncovered in New York.<strong> </strong> The OIG was drawn into
investigating this scheme after numerous Medicare beneficiaries complained to their carriers
that they had not received the services for which Medicare was billed.  We interviewed the
beneficiaries and verified that claims had been submitted for services that were not actually
rendered.  These companies billed Medicare for millions in fraudulent claims.  In one
instance, three of the companies billing for ear implants received checks from Medicare
totaling approximately $1 million in less than a month.  The bank where the money was
being deposited became suspicious and called the carrier which, in turn, stopped payment on
the checks.  The carrier had placed a system alert on these companies if they submitted
claims for MRI services, so the fictitious companies began submitting claims for ear
implants and were paid.
<p>	<br wp="br2">  <li>

<p><strong><em>Partial Hospitalization and Community Mental Health Centers</em></strong>.  In collaboration with
HCFA, we examined the growth of Medicare expenditures to community mental health
centers for partial hospitalization services (highly intensive outpatient psychiatric services). 
We found that Medicare was paying for services to beneficiaries who had no history of
mental illness and for therapy sessions that consisted of only recreational and diversionary
activities, such as watching television, dancing, and playing games.  Our review in five
States, which accounted for 77 percent of partial hospitalization payments to mental health
centers nationally during 1996, disclosed that over 90 percent of the services, or $229 million
in Medicare payments, were unallowable or highly questionable.  From that review, we were
able to identify potentially abusive centers for in-depth audits and, based on our results,
referred all of these centers for investigation of potential fraud.  Currently, investigations are
underway at 18 centers identified from this work and from other sources.<br>
<br wp="br2">  <li>
<p><strong><em>Hospital Outpatient Psychiatric Services</em></strong>.  The OIG conducted a 10-State review of
outpatient psychiatric services which accounted for 77 percent of the value of partial
hospitalization and other outpatient psychiatric claims at acute care hospitals nationally.  We
estimated that almost 60 percent of the $382 million in 1997 outpatient psychiatric claims
made by hospitals did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements.  These unallowable
services were not reasonable and necessary for the patient's condition, not authorized and/or
supervised by a physician, not adequately documented or not documented at all, or rendered
by unlicensed personnel.  Our reviews at individual hospitals found similar problems, as well
as alteration of medical records after we selected the records for review.  To determine
whether fraud was a factor in these cases, additional work is being performed.  Overall, we
have 69 ongoing investigations.
<p><em><strong>Undercover Operations</strong></em>

<p>We occasionally conduct undercover operations to identify potential fraud.  Past undercover
operations have targeted podiatrists, opthalmologists, chiropractors, medical doctors, DME
companies, billing companies, and laboratories for various Medicare billing fraud schemes, such as
billing for medically unnecessary services, billing for services not provided, soliciting and receiving
kickbacks, upcoding services, unbundling services, and misusing provider Medicare billing
numbers.  Many of these undercover operations are conducted jointly with other Federal agencies,
including the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the
Drug Enforcement Agency, since violations often fall within their jurisdictions as well.
<p>For example, an ongoing multiagency undercover project targeted certain DME providers.  The
DME companies offered cash kickbacks to undercover operatives (Federal agents) in exchange for
patient referrals.  In addition, some companies billed Medicare and/or Medicaid for medically
unnecessary services, services not provided, and/or upcoded services.  The operation also identified
physicians involved in the scheme.  To date, this project has resulted in 20 convictions with nearly
$1 million in restitutions, fines, and savings.  Additional cases are currently being adjudicated, and
more convictions are expected.
<p align="center">* * * * * *

<p>In conclusion, we would like to commend HCFA for incorporating an improper payment
methodology into its internal control structure for Medicare, and we note that it was one of the first
health care programs to develop such a technique.  Modifications to the methodology being made by
HCFA would further enhance its ability to identify areas in need of corrective action.  With respect
to other techniques being discussed today to expand the error rate process, we believe they are
currently being used to the extent appropriate.  For example, we have used beneficiary contacts in
high-risk areas for the past 4 years.  Such techniques as provider profiling have long been used as a
means for targeting providers for fraud investigations and, as we have noted, have led to a
significant number of investigative referrals.  To incorporate additional fraud development
techniques into the error rate methodology, in our opinion, would be cost prohibitive and extremely
time-consuming and would divert substantial resources from the Department's highly successful
fraud-fighting efforts.  We believe that all the techniques discussed have their appropriate uses in a
comprehensive, flexible anti-fraud system.  We, HCFA, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and
other enforcement entities will continue to apply these techniques in the most cost-effective manner
that ensures the best outcomes for Medicare and other Federal health care programs.</li>
