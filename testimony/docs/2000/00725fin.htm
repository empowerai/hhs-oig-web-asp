<hr>
<p>


Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee.  I am John E. Hartwig,
Deputy Inspector General for Investigations in the Office of  Inspector General.  Thank
you for the invitation to appear today to discuss our efforts and accomplishments in our
ongoing fight against waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program as well as the
challenges that continue to face us.  We have made substantial progress in combating
these problems but the challenges that confront us are still daunting.  We appreciate the
interest and support of the Subcommittee and Congress in helping to provide the tools
and resources we need to address the problem of Medicare.</p>
<p>Over the years we have made numerous recommendations in our reports that would help
prevent fraud and abuse against the Department's programs and strengthen the hand of
the Department to detect and prosecute each fraud.  Congresswoman Judy Biggert and
Senator Susan Collins have both introduced bills which contain provisions designed to
support our work and recommendations.  We very much appreciate this support for
health care fraud enforcement and thank Congresswoman Biggert, Senator Collins and
the various cosponsors for introducing these bills.  We also appreciate the fact that the
need for legislative action is being considered by this Subcommittee today.  My
testimony will provide a broad picture of the conditions underlying the need for enhanced
methods and authorities to protect Federal tax dollars, not only for Medicare and our
office, but for other offices of Inspectors General as well through such provisions as
statutory law enforcement provisions.
<p>With your endorsement and passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), our office acquired important and much needed
authorities and financial resources which have permitted us to expand and intensify our
fight against health care fraud.  As a result of this funding, the Office of Investigations
has been able to move steadily toward its goal of extending its investigative staff to be
physically present in all States in the country particularly those areas that were
underserved in lean budget years prior to HIPAA.
<p>As we talk about Medicare fraud today, I must emphasis again that we continue to
believe that most health care providers do their best to provide high quality care and are
honest in their dealings with Medicare.  When we talk about fraud, we are not talking
about providers who make innocent billing errors, but rather those who intentionally set
out to defraud the Medicare program or abuse Medicare beneficiaries.  The importance of
our ongoing work is not only to protect the taxpayers and ensure quality healthcare for
Medicare beneficiaries, but to also make the Medicare environment one in which honest
providers can operate on a level-playing field and do not find themselves in unfair
competition with criminals.
<p>As a result of an unparalleled cooperative response to the problem of health care waste,
fraud and abuse by the Congress, the Administration, the healthcare community, and
senior advocacy groups, we have been able to identify, expose and respond to the
problem more completely and accurately than before.  It is bigger, more sophisticated,
and more formidable than many may have imagined.  Twenty years ago, Medicare
expended $22 billion, and we were primarily investigating single-subject cases.  Back
then a million dollar case was considered rather large.  Currently, program outlays exceed
$200 billion, and multiple-subject cases are commonplace.  We see millions of dollars
stolen in a single scheme.  With today's technology, fraudulent providers can bill the
system electronically, make quick hits for large amounts of money, and move on before
they are detected.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
In addition to the change in the nature of health care fraud, we have also noticed a change
in the individuals committing health care fraud.  In the past, most of our investigations
involved individuals with a legitimate reason for being in the health care system, but who
misused their positions to fraudulently bill Medicare due to greed.  In recent years, we
have begun investigating an increasing number of criminals with no medical background,
merely in the program to make large amounts of money illegally.  Today's criminals
know where the money is and how to get it.  They also know where the radar is and how
to fly under it, undetected.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Because we have better tools, and are better organized than in the past, we continue to
have successes and are confident of favorable outcomes on several fronts. However, we
must temper our optimism and remain vigilant.  Due to the complexity of the Medicare
program and the tremendous number of dollars flowing through the program, there will
always be those who will continue to seek loopholes and look for ways to siphon those
dollars earmarked for maintaining and improving the health of the elderly and disabled in
this country.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br>
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) was created in 1976 and is statutorily charged
with protecting the integrity of our Department's programs, as well as promoting their
economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  The OIG meets this statutory mandate through a
comprehensive program of audits, program evaluations, and investigations designed to
improve the management of the department and to protect its programs and beneficiaries
from fraud, waste and abuse.  Our role is to detect and prevent waste, fraud and abuse,
and to ensure that beneficiaries receive high quality, necessary services, at appropriate
payment levels.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
To determine fraud, the OIG typically obtains information through a combination of
investigative techniques tailored to each case.  These tools include subpoenas of medical
and billing records, use of search warrants, investigative interviews of provider
employees, surveillance, and undercover operations.  The OIG also receives allegations
of wrongdoing from a number of sources, including beneficiaries, ex-employees of
providers, competitors, contractors and Qui Tam (False Claims Act) complainants. 
Because Qui Tams typically are based on insider information, they have proved most
useful in terms of identifying large-dollar vulnerabilities.  In fact, since calendar year
1996, we have received 1,074 Qui Tam allegations, of which over 300 are under active
investigation.  The Medicare contractor fraud control units also refer cases to the OIG
and other law enforcement authorities for consideration of civil or criminal prosecution
and application of administrative sanctions.  In FYs 1998 and 1999, 1,600 referrals were
made by these fraud units.  And finally, many of our leads on potential fraud are
developed through our audits, inspections and evaluations of various aspects of the
Medicare program.  

<br wp="br1"><br>
The Government uses criminal and civil remedies to address health care violations of
law.  Criminal statutes are used to prosecute health care offenders who willfully intend to
commit a crime. The standard of proof in these violations is beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In addition, the Government uses civil prosecutions against offenses that are committed
with the actual knowledge of the falsity of the claim, with reckless disregard or with
deliberate ignorance of the truth or the falsity of the claim.  The other major civil remedy
available to our agency is the Civil Monetary Penalties Law which has the same standard
of proof as the civil False Claims Act.  Neither the criminal nor civil statutes are used to
cover mistakes, errors, misunderstanding of the rules, or simple negligence.  Our office is
very mindful of the differences between innocent errors ("erroneous" claims ) and
intentional or reckless conduct ("fraudulent claims") and strive to affect appropriate
resolutions to these different types of inappropriate claims.

<br wp="br1"><br>
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is the largest single purchaser of
health care in the world.  With expenditures of approximately $316 billion, assets of $212
billion, and liabilities of $39 billion, HCFA is also the largest component of the
Department.  In 1999, Medicare and Medicaid outlays represent 33.7 cents of every
dollar of health care spent in the United States.  In view of Medicare's 39.5 million
beneficiaries, 870 million claims processed and paid annually, complex reimbursement
rules, and decentralized operations, the program is inherently at high risk for payment
errors and fraudulent schemes.

<br wp="br1"><strong><br>
NATURE OF MEDICARE FRAUD AND ABUSE</strong>

<p>We in the Office of Inspector General are heartened by the support we have received
from the Congress, the Administration, the healthcare community and Medicare
beneficiaries in our fight against fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare program.  While
our recent error estimates in the fee-for-service part of Medicare shows a general decline,
it is still too high; all money improperly paid is wasteful.  We recognize these audits do
not always detect well known forms of fraud such as kickbacks or deliberate forgery of
bills.   Whatever the audits reveal or fail to reveal, we know from our investigations and
from complaints that we receive that waste, fraud and abuse is still pervasive in the health
care sector.

<br wp="br1"><br>
All of this is to say that we cannot let our guard down in our fight against fraud, waste,
and abuse.  We are still watching all areas of Medicare through our audits, inspections
and investigations.  And, we are continuing to encourage and receive support from
industry and beneficiary groups in our efforts.  At this time, however, I would like to
single out some areas where we continue to have special concerns and give some
examples of the results of several significant evaluations, audits and investigations which
exemplify the types of fraudulent and abusive activities we continue to see.

<br wp="br1"><strong><em><br>
Lack of Physical Address</em>

</strong>

<p><strong><em>	DME - </em></strong>After sampling 36 new durable medical equipment applicants in the
Miami, Florida area, HCFA reported that 32 were not bona fide businesses. 
Among other problems, some bogus applicants did not have a physical address or
an inventory of DME.  According to HCFA, those companies should not have
been issued a supplier number because they were not operational entities.  To
determine the prevalence of this problem, we sampled suppliers and applicants in
12 large metropolitan areas in New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois and California at
HCFA's request.  Our inspection found that 1 of every 14 suppliers and 1 of every
9 new applicants did not have a required physical address.  When we checked
questionable addresses, we usually found that the business had closed or had a
questionable presence at the address.  Some addresses were merely mail drop
locations or were nonexistent or could not be located.  These types of problems
with physical addresses often indicate potentially illegitimate business
arrangements.

<br wp="br1"><em><strong><br>
Services Not Rendered</strong></em>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>DME -</em></strong> A classic example is a case we uncovered in New York.  The OIG was
drawn into investigating this scheme after numerous Medicare beneficiaries
complained to their carriers that claims had been submitted for services that were
not actually rendered.  These companies billed Medicare for millions in fraudulent
claims.  In one instance, three of the companies billing for ear implants received
checks from Medicare totaling approximately $1 million in less than a month. 
The bank where the money was being deposited became suspicious and called the
carrier which, in turn, stopped payment on the checks.  Previously the carrier had
placed a system alert on these companies when they had submitted fraudulent
claims for MRI services.  Because of this alert for improper MRI billings, the
fictitious companies then began submitting claims for ear implants instead.  </li>

</ul>

<p>	As another example, the OIG investigated a matter involving members of a
Russian organized crime syndicate who conspired to defraud the Medicare
program by submitting false claims for durable medical equipment that was not
prescribed, needed or delivered.  One of the subjects of the investigation had a
criminal record involving narcotics violations.  A search at his home uncovered
firearms, drugs and drug paraphernalia.  In all, four individuals were found guilty
of fraud.  The loss to the Medicare program as a result of the scheme was $1.7
million.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<em><strong>Improper Acquisition and Use of Medicare Beneficiary Identification Numbers</strong>

</em>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>DME-</em></strong> In New York, two sales people from two DME companies were arrested
and because of statements made, a search warrant was executed on one of the
subject's residences.  Agents found evidence of false Medicare billings.  The
scheme consisted of the two subjects visiting senior citizen high-rises and
conducting health fairs where they coaxed beneficiaries into giving them their
Medicare numbers.  The subjects then furnished these numbers along with
certificates of medical necessity to two DME companies. These companies then
billed for equipment, much of which were never supplied, causing payments of
more than $750,000 from the Medicare program.  Both subjects arrested had
recent, lengthy criminal records, including assaults on Federal agents and both
DME companies had previously been convicted as a result of OIG investigations. 
Each of the subjects was found guilty and sentenced to 2 years, 9 months
incarceration and 2 years probation.</li>

</ul>

<p><em><strong>Excessive Billings for Individual Beneficiaries</strong></em>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong>DME -</strong></em>We have uncovered another example of the improper use of Medicare
beneficiary identification numbers in the Los Angeles area.  We have found Los
Angeles is permeated with fraudulent health care operations including
laboratories, clinics, and DME.  In 1997, in concert with the OIG and FBI's
investigations of these entities, Transamerica Occidental Insurance, the Medicare
contractor, reviewed the increased billings attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. 
We found some very disturbing patterns.  Many beneficiaries showed an
extremely high Medicare service rate.  An example of one beneficiary's durable
medical equipment history is demonstrated in Chart A.</li>

<p>Our review indicated that beneficiaries were being ping-ponged from one entity to
another or their billing information was being traded or sold by many alleged medical
providers. When we looked at over-utilized beneficiary numbers, we found they
represented individuals who were enticed into the scheme by cash or gratuity, were
mentally handicapped, and/or were homeless.
<p>In February 1999, pre-pay edits were instituted on 40 beneficiary numbers, denying all
Medicare payments.  There were no complaints.  CHART B illustrates the four month
savings to the Medicare program on just 10 of these beneficiaries.

<p>In August 1999, an additional 120 beneficiary numbers were placed on payment denial
screens.  There were still no complaints from beneficiaries.  Since these screens were
implemented the Medicare contractor has denied claims totaling over $7.3 million.  We
anticipate adding more Medicare beneficiary numbers to this project.
<p>In addition to these investigations, we found several other problems in the area of durable
medical equipment.
<p><strong><em>OIG Evaluations of Specific DME Services -</em>

</strong>

<ul>
  <li>	We found that Medicare paid an estimated $20.6 million in 1997 for
services that started after a beneficiary's date of death.  Almost half of this
was for durable medical equipment claims.</li>

  <li>	We recently reported that 42 percent of claims for orthotic body jackets
were for more expensive items than the one actually provided.</li>

  <li>	We reported that nearly 25 percent of certificates of medical necessity for
home oxygen were inaccurate or incomplete.  In addition, 13 percent of
beneficiaries reported never using their portable oxygen systems. </li>

  <li>	We found that 57 percent of documentation for therapeutic shoe claims
were missing or inaccurate.</li>

  <li>	We found that Medicare allowed an estimated $79 million in 1997 in
claims for blood glucose test strips, of which the appropriate documentation
was flawed or missing.  Of this, $16.5 million in claims were for
beneficiaries who were not eligible to receive test strips because they did
not receive insulin.  In 18 percent of the claims, reviewers could not find
documentation indicating that the product was delivered.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Partial Hospitalization and Community Mental Health Centers</em></strong>

<p>In collaboration with HCFA, we examined the growth of Medicare expenditures to
community mental health centers for partial hospitalization services (highly intensive
psychiatric services).  We found that Medicare was paying for services to beneficiaries
who had no history of mental illness and for therapy sessions that consisted of only
recreational and diversionary activities, such as watching television, dancing and playing
games.  Our review in five States, which accounted for 77 percent of partial
hospitalization payments to mental health centers nationally during 1996, disclosed that
over 90 percent of the services, or $229 million in Medicare payments, were unallowable
or highly questionable.  From that review, we were able to identify potentially abusive
centers for in-depth audits and, based on our results, referred all of these centers for
investigation of potential fraud.  Currently, investigations are underway at 18 centers
identified from this work and other sources.
<p><strong><em>Hospital Outpatient Psychiatric Services</em></strong>

<p>The OIG conducted a 10-State review of outpatient psychiatric services, which accounted
for 77 percent of the value of the partial hospitalization program and other outpatient
psychiatric claims at acute care hospitals nationally.  We estimated that almost 60 percent
of the $382 million in 1997 outpatient psychiatric claims made by hospitals did not meet
Medicare reimbursement requirements.  These unallowable services included: services
not reasonable and necessary for the patient's condition; services not authorized and/or
supervised by a physician; services not adequately documented or not documented at all;
and services rendered by unlicenced personnel.  Our reviews at individual hospitals
found similar problems, as well as alteration of medical record after we selected the
records for review.  To determine whether fraud was a factor in these cases,  additional
work is being performed.  Overall, we have 69 ongoing investigations.
<p><em><strong>Medicare Contractors</strong></em>

<p>The Medicare program is administered by the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) with the help of 64 contractors that handle claims processing and administration. 
The contractors are responsible for paying health care providers for the services provided
under Medicare fee-for-service, providing a full accounting of funds and conducting
activities designed to safeguard the program and its funds.  There are two types of
contractors -- fiscal intermediaries and carriers.  Intermediaries process claims filed
under Part A of the Medicare program from institutions, such as hospitals and skilled
nursing facilities; carriers process claims under Part B of the program from other health
care providers such as physicians and medical equipment suppliers.
<p>Of all the problems we have observed, perhaps the most troubling has to do with
contractors' own integrity -- misusing government funds and actively trying to conceal
these actions and altering documents and falsifying statements that specific work was
performed.  In some cases, contractors prepared bogus documents to falsely demonstrate
superior performance for which Medicare rewarded them with bonuses and additional
contracts.  In other examples, contractors adjusted their claims processing so that system
edits designed to prevent inappropriate payments were turned off, resulting in misspent
Medicare Trust Fund dollars.  We have also encountered problems associated with
financial management and accounting procedures and longstanding weaknesses in
internal controls, including deficiencies related to the receivable amounts reported in
HCFA's financial statements and electronic data processing.
<p>In addition, there have been numerous allegations that contractors have falsified
statements that specific work was performed, and had altered, removed, concealed and
destroyed documents to improve their ratings on Medicare performance evaluations. 
Wrongdoing has been identified and we have entered into civil settlements with 13
Medicare contractors since 1993, with total settlements exceeding $350 million.  In
addition, two contractors have entered into guilty pleas for obstruction of a federal audit.
<p><em><strong>Home Health </strong></em>

<p>Looking behind the explosive growth in Medicare expenditures for home health care
since 1990, OIG, using claims data from 1995 through part of 1996, found a high
percentage of the payments were improper.  We also determined that many home health
agencies shared characteristics that could undermine the Department's ability to recover
overpayments or levy sanctions.  Our recommendations to strengthen the Medicare
certification process and to otherwise protect the Trust Fund were adopted in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  Conducted at the Department's request, our follow-up
work, which examined 1998 claims data, noted that the payment error rate had fallen to
19 percent.  Additional reviews at individual home health agencies have led to 420
investigations of potential fraud since October of 1997, and 130 of these investigations
are ongoing.
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Improper Billing and Potential Abuse - </em> </strong>A particularly egregious case of
misappropriated Medicare funds and potential abuse of Medicare patients was
noted at St. John's Home Health Agency, the highest paid home health agency in
South Florida.  We found that St. John's billed Medicare for nonrendered or
upcoded home health services, that nurses and home health aides permitted
subcontracting groups to use their names and/or create fraudulent documents to
support nonrendered services, and that some nursing visits were provided by
unlicensed persons.  Further, subcontractors paid kickbacks to St. John's
employees in order to do business with them.  In December 1999, 26 people were
indicted for racketeering, conspiring to racketeer, conspiring to launder money and
conspiring to submit false claims against the Medicare program.  Subsequent to
plea or trial, there were 24 guilty verdicts (1 individual became a fugitive and 1
was acquitted); all 24 of those found guilty are in the process of being excluded
from Federal health care programs. 	</li>
  <li><strong><em>Ghost Employees and Lack of Medical Credentials  -</em> </strong> A married couple, neither
of whom had medical certification, portrayed themselves as physical therapists
and even contracted with several home health agencies to provide services to
beneficiaries.  One of the subjects began her own HHA using ghost employees and
assuming the identities of six licensed therapists.  Through this company and
claims submitted by other HHA's for the couple's services, the Medicare program
and private insurers were defrauded of over $400,000.  Both husband and wife
were found guilty of fraud and four home health agencies entered into civil
settlements with the Government on their failure to check the credentials of 
contracted physical therapists.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Use of Deceased Physician's Billing Number</em></strong>

<p>A subject in Florida was sentenced to 13 months incarceration for impersonating a
physician and submitting false claims to Medicare, the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services(CHAMPUS) and private insurance programs.  A
pharmacist reported that a doctor was prescribing large amounts of controlled substances. 
After some inquiries, it was found that the prescribing doctor had been dead since 1986. 
The subject, who was a friend and attorney of the deceased doctor, had intercepted a
letter from Florida querying the doctor's application to practice medicine.  The subject
then received the deceased doctor's renewed license and practiced medicine at several
clinics in Florida.  He acted as medical director of the clinics and then opened another
with his wife as office manager.  The subject was ordered to pay $113,800 in restitution,
$45,800 of that to Medicare.  

<br wp="br1"><br>
<strong><em>Dialysis Company</em>

</strong>

<p>A case that began with a Qui Tam complaint centered on misconduct perpetrated by
National Medical Care, a nationwide dialysis company, and several of its subsidiaries
before its 1996 merger with Fresenius Medical Care Holdings Inc. (FMCH), the Nation's
largest provider of kidney dialysis products and services.  The Government recently
reached a record-breaking Medicare fraud settlement with Fresenius.  As a result of a
joint investigation by OIG and multiple law enforcement agencies and an OIG audit,
FMCH agreed to a global resolution under which three subsidiaries pled guilty, and the
company agreed to pay $486 million to resolve the criminal and civil aspects of the case. 
As part of the civil settlement agreement for credit balances, the company paid directly to
HCFA $11 million for overpayments which were previously reported to the fiscal
intermediaries but never recouped.  The alleged criminal misconduct involved illegal
kickback activity, submission of false claims for dialysis-related nutrition therapy
services, improper billing for laboratory services and false reporting of credit balances. 
As part of the settlement, the company also entered into the most comprehensive
corporate integrity agreement ever imposed by the OIG.

<br wp="br1"><strong><br>
RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS </strong>

<p>Many specific, positive changes have been made to shore up the over $200 billion
Medicare program and its payment methods.  Thanks to increased resources provided
through recent legislation, our Department, the Department of Justice (DoJ), and related
agencies at the State and Federal levels now have increased authority and capacity to
fight fraud and to reduce waste in all federally-funded health care programs.  These new
tools have facilitated our efforts to prevent fraud, waste and abuse from occurring in the
first place.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<em><strong>HIPAA Accomplishments - Increased Recoveries, Exclusions, Convictions and
Settlements </strong></em>

<p>The Fraud and Abuse Control Program (the Program), a key part of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, enabled us to boost our efforts in identifying
and preventing waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare.  This legislation has provided much
needed resources, stronger enforcement tools, and a management structure to coordinate
the efforts of numerous fraud fighting units of Federal, State and local governments.

<p>The Program is under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, working through the Inspector General.  HIPAA mandates a
comprehensive program of investigations, audits and evaluations of health care delivery;
authorizes new criminal, civil and administrative remedies; requires guidance to the
health care industry about potentially fraudulent health care practices; and establishes a
national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions imposed against health care
providers.  The Act also provides an innovative mechanism to fund these new anti-fraud
efforts, thereby assuring that needed resources are always available for the effort.

<br wp="br1"><br>
We are grateful to the Congress in passing this landmark legislation and we are pleased to
report that we are already reaping substantial benefits from the additional resources and
authorities.  In the past three years under HIPAA (FY 1997 through FY 1999), we have
reported overall savings of $31.0 billion.  This is comprised of  $226 million in audit
disallowances, $2.1 billion in investigative receivables, and $28.7 billion in savings from
implemented legislative or regulatory recommendations and actions to put funds to better
use.  The savings that result from our recommendations that are implemented into law or
regulation, and independently scored by the Congressional Budget Office or HCFA,
represent taxpayer or Medicare Trust Fund dollars that will not be spent for fraudulent
gain.
<p>During this same period, we excluded more than 8,697 abusive or fraudulent individuals
and entities from doing business with Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal and State
health care programs.  Additional accomplishments include 1,085 convictions of
individuals or entities that engaged in crimes against departmental programs, including
Medicare.  We increased convictions by nearly 20 percent in 1997, another 16 percent in
1998 and by almost 54 percent in 1999.
<p><em><strong>Medicare Fee-For-Service Payment Error Rate</strong></em>

<p>The OIG issued its fourth report on the Medicare fee-for-service payment error rate and
recently testimony before this Subcommittee on our findings.  Based on a statistically
valid sample, improper payments totaled an estimated $13.5 billion, or about 8.0 percent
of the $169.5 billion in FY 1999 processed fee-for-service payments.  Improper payments
include those for: unsupported services, medically unnecessary services, errors due to
incorrect coding and noncovered services.  Over the four years we have conducted this
audit, the improper payment rate declined by 42 percent, from a midpoint of $23.2 billion
(14 percent) in 1996,  to $13.5 billion (8.0 percent) in FY 1999--a drop of $9.7 billion.
<p>Many Medicare watchers attribute at least part of  this downward trend to the increased
oversight and enforcement efforts of our office, HCFA, DoJ and the FBI that were made
possible by the steady funding stream created by HIPAA.  According to the Medicare
Trustees and the Congressional Budget Office, these waste, fraud and abuse efforts
contributed to Medicare's lowest inflation rate in history and to the extension of the
viability of the Trust Fund until 2025 -- a 26 year extension brought about over the last
three years.

<br wp="br1"><strong><em><br>
Waste, Fraud and Abuse Prevention</em>

</strong>

<p>The OIG has continued to expand activities designed not just to uncover existing waste,
fraud and abuse, but to prevent it.  A cornerstone of our prevention efforts has been the
development of compliance program guidance to encourage and enlist the private health
care industry in the fight against waste, fraud and abuse.  The guidance is developed in
cooperation with the provider community and identifies steps that health care providers
may voluntarily take to improve their compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules.  We
have published eight compliance guidance documents covering hospitals, clinical
laboratories, home health agencies, third-party billing companies, durable medical
equipment, hospices, Medicare + Choice organizations and nursing facilities.  We have
recently invited comments on our draft guidance related to individual physicians and
small group practices.

<br wp="br1"><br>
The OIG has also increased its activities with respect to monitoring settlement
agreements with integrity provisions and corporate integrity agreements that have been
entered into by health care providers as part of a global settlement of OIG investigations
and audits.  The current caseload of approximately 440 is expected to increase to over
475 by the end of 2000.  Our efforts to focus on preventing health care fraud also
includes guidance to the industry on the propriety of health care transactions.  The OIG
has published two significant final regulations creating 10 new safe harbors to the Federal
anti-kickback statute.  Finally, the OIG continues to promote beneficiary involvement in
identifying fraudulent activities.  This includes operating our HHS hotline which
currently receives approximately 48,000 calls per month. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<strong>UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br>
We occasionally conduct undercover operations to identify potential fraud.  Past
undercover operations have investigated podiatrists, ophthalmologists, chiropractors,
medical doctors, DME companies, billing companies and laboratories for various
Medicare billing fraud schemes, such as billing for medically unnecessary services,
billing for services not provided, soliciting and receiving kickbacks, upcoding services,
unbundling services and misusing provider Medicare billing numbers.  Many of these
undercover operations are conducted jointly with other Federal agencies including the
Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), since violations often fall within their jurisdictions
as well. 

<br wp="br1"><br>
An ongoing multiagency undercover project investigated certain DME providers.  The
DME companies offered cash kickbacks to undercover operatives (Federal agents) in
exchange for patient referrals.  In addition, some companies billed Medicare and/or
Medicaid for medically unnecessary services, services not provided, and/or upcoded
services.  The operation also identified physicians involved in the scheme.  To date, this
project has resulted in 20 convictions with nearly $1 million in restitutions, fines and
savings.  Additional cases are currently being adjudicated, and more convictions are
expected.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<strong>STATUTORY PROVISIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br>
We appreciate the hard work of this Subcommittee, and in particular Congresswoman
Biggert (and Senator Collins), to craft legislation designed to help the law enforcement
community.  Such efforts will further strengthen the HHS Office of Inspector General to
detect and investigate Medicare fraud and we recognize that many of the provisions that
Congresswoman Biggert has included in H.R. 3461 will facilitate a more efficient and
effective anti-fraud effort.  We look forward to having a dialogue today about the
provisions in this important legislation.  

<br wp="br1"><strong><br>
LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY</strong> 

<br wp="br1"><br>
Statutory law enforcement authority is and has been a top priority for the HHS-Office of
Inspector General, as well as the inspector general community, for a number of years. 
We appreciate the recognition that H.R. 3461 gives to this very important issue. 
Currently, we operate through temporary grants of law enforcement authority, granted by
the United States Marshals Service.  The HHS-OIG conducts lengthy and complex
investigations that require the exercise of law enforcement powers (arrests, search
warrants, undercover and consensual monitoring activities).  In order to carry out these
responsibilities, the HHS-OIG needs a permanent, not conditional, grant of law
enforcement authority.

<br wp="br1"><br>
In support of IG law enforcement authority, earlier this year the Administration submitted
to the Congress a legislative proposal that would amend the Inspector General Act to
authorize criminal investigators in the offices of 23 presidentially-appointed Inspectors
General to exercise law enforcement powers-- namely authority to seek and execute
search and arrest warrants, make an arrest without a warrant for offenses committed in
their presence and to carry a firearm -- in the course of their official duties.

<br wp="br1"><br>
Further details on this statutory law enforcement issue are attached to this statement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br>
As I stated at the beginning of my testimony, I believe a concentrated effort by a large
number of people has resulted in tangible progress in combating fraud, waste and abuse
in recent years.  I particularly appreciate the strong partnerships that we have formed with
the Congress, program managers and the law enforcement community.  But as I have also
discussed with you today, the problems that remain are serious, complicated and have
profound consequences.  I am particularly concerned about the deliberate fraud which we
cannot always precisely measure but that we know continues.  We must never let down
our guard, and we must continue to dedicate the resources and make the concerted effort
to reduce these problems and continue to ensure the integrity of the Medicare program..

<br wp="br1"><br>
We in the Office of Inspector General continue to actively oversee the new resources and
safeguards provided in the HIPAA and to ensure their effectiveness in preventing and
combating criminal activities.  For true criminals, the only effective safeguards are
effective program measures to prevent fraud and a strong law enforcement presence with
equally strong penalties applied to defrauders.  In addition, we believe that granting
statutory law enforcement authority would be a very positive and important step in
providing continuity and permanence for our enforcement activities.
<p align="left">I greatly appreciate the opportunity you have given me today to focus attention on the
types of fraud and abuse that still confront the Medicare program, the opportunity to
share with you our progress as a result of some of our recent initiatives, and the ability to
have a discussion on legislation vital to the inspector general community.   I would be
happy to answer any questions.

<strong>ATTACHMENT</strong>

<p>Earlier this year, the Department of Justice submitted to the Congress a legislative
proposal that would amend the Inspector General Act to authorize criminal investigators
in the offices of 23 presidentially-appointed Inspectors General to exercise law
enforcement powers in the course of their official duties --  authority to seek and execute
search and arrest warrants, make an arrest without a warrant for offenses committed in
their presence, and to carry a firearm.
<p>It is important to emphasize that this grant of statutory law enforcement authority would
extend <u>no</u> new authorities, but would simply recognize in statute authorities that are
already being exercised.  Criminal investigators in the covered OIGs have exercised law
enforcement powers for many years under designations as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals. 
Beginning in the mid-1980s the Department of Justice approved these deputations on a
case-by-case basis.  As the role of Inspectors General evolved, the need for such
appointments was so consistent and the volume of requests so large that "blanket"
deputations evolved.   Since approximately 1995, virtually all criminal investigators in
the offices of the 23 covered Inspectors General have exercised law enforcement
authorities under office-wide deputations.	

<p>Although OIGs are already exercising law enforcement powers, both the Department of
Justice and the OIGs believe that statutory recognition of these authorities is vital.  Under
the current arrangement, the U.S. Marshal's Service confers law enforcement authority
upon over 2,500 OIG agents across the Federal government.  However, day-to-day
supervision and control over the exercise of those authorities rests with each Inspector
General.  The Marshals cannot and do not monitor the thousands of pending OIG
investigations in which law enforcement authorities are being exercised.  The proposed
statutory grant of law enforcement authority would appropriately place all  responsibility
for law enforcement authorities to the Inspectors General, themselves, with important
oversight by and accountability to the Attorney General.
<p>Representatives of the IG community have been meeting with congressional staff to
discuss statutory law enforcement authority for designated OIGs.  During these
discussions, some concern has been expressed that a statutory grant of authority -- instead
of a renewable administrative deputation -- might result in <em>decreased</em> oversight of law
enforcement.  Exactly the opposite is true.
<p>First, under this proposal, law enforcement powers must be exercised in accordance with
guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General.  These guidelines will govern issues
such as use of force, consensual interception of communications, coordination with other
Federal investigators and prosecutors, adherence to personnel and training standards, and
periodic reporting.  Where an Inspector General fails to adhere to guidelines for exercise
of law enforcement authorities, the Attorney General is authorized to suspend or rescind
such authorities.  Thus, the Justice Department retains oversight of the exercise of law
enforcement powers. 

<p>In addition, for the first time, Inspectors General would be subject to "peer reviews" of
their exercise of law enforcement powers, to be conducted by another Inspector General
or committee of Inspectors General.  The results of each review will be communicated
directly to the Attorney General.   With these DoJ guidelines and  peer reviews, the
Justice Department's bill would actually result in <em>enhanced</em> accountability by OIGs in
their exercise of law enforcement authorities.
<p>A statutory grant of authority would also provide certainty and permanence for OIG
enforcement activities. <strong> </strong>The OIGs regularly conduct complex investigations that require
the ongoing exercise of law enforcement authorities (arrests, search warrants, and
undercover activities) during investigations that often last for years.  As members of
numerous national and local task forces, other Federal, State and local law enforcement
officers depend on OIGs' uninterrupted participation in the enforcement activities of the
task force.  Administrative deputations, which must be periodically renewed, cannot offer
such a guarantee of continuity.<strong>  </strong> 

<p>In this regard, we have learned that the Justice Department is considering not renewing
all OIG blanket deputation authorities as of January 31, 2001.   If blanket deputations to
the 23 OIGs covered in the bill are terminated, without passage of a statute granting law
enforcement authority to IGs, it  would jeopardize literally thousands of open
investigations of fraud against agency programs across government.  Investigations of
fraud in health care, Federal procurement, telecommunications, Federal construction,
bribery of public officials, crimes in subsidized housing, corruption in highway
construction, child support enforcement and a host of other cases would simply cease. 
Moreover, if we were forced to return to a process in which we sought deputation for
each individual case, the administrative burden for both the Department of Justice and the
Inspectors General would, indeed, be enormous.  We ask that the Congress foreclose this
possibility with a grant of statutory law enforcement.  

<br wp="br1"><br>
Statutory law enforcement authority would also be consistent with and promote the
continued independence of the Inspectors General.   Under the current arrangement,
delay or non-renewal of a deputation could be perceived as an attempt to influence and
OIG, or even derail an investigation.  We emphasize that we know of <u>no</u> instance in
which such interference has occurred; however, a statutory grant would foreclose this
perception.	

<p>The Department of Justice's legislative proposal would also ensure the consistency of
law enforcement powers among OIGs.  Some Inspectors General already exercise law
enforcement powers under statutory authority unique to their offices (e.g., the OIGs at the
Departments of Defense and Agriculture).  Pending bills would confer law enforcement
authority on other specific OIGs.  The proposal sent by the Justice Department would
ensure that <em>all</em> statutory Inspectors General operated under the same law enforcement
authorities and with the same accountability and oversight.	

<p>Congressional staff have also asked whether the proposed legislation would broaden the
authority of the Inspectors General or expand the categories of those authorized to
exercise law enforcement powers.  It would not.  Law enforcement authority could only
be exercised by trained, qualified law enforcement officers who report to the Assistant
Inspector General for Investigations (auditors could not exercise these authorities), and
only in connection with investigations that are already in the jurisdiction of the Inspector
General to conduct.  Thus, the proposal would have no impact on the jurisdiction of the
various Inspectors General. <strong> </strong>Moreover, the proposal would carry with it no additional
costs, since OIG agents are already exercising these authorities, are already fully trained
in their exercise, and are already Federal law enforcement officers for purposes of the law
enforcement retirement system, and otherwise.
<p>The OIGs have achieved impressive successes in law enforcement.  We regularly face
situations which pose dangers to ourselves, our fellow law enforcement officers, and
members of the public.  For many years, we have exercised law enforcement authorities
to further our statutory responsibilities to investigate fraud in our respective agency
programs and operations.  We have achieved these successes with an impressive record
of professional and responsible conduct.
<p>The Department of Justice has recognized this evolving role of Inspectors General by
submitting to the Congress a legislative proposal that offers reliable, permanent law
enforcement authorities to qualifying OIGs.  On behalf of the entire OIG community, we
urge you to endorse this proposal.
