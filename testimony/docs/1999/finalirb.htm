<hr>
<p>Good morning. I am Dr. Mark R. Yessian, Regional Inspector General for Evaluation 
  and Inspections, in the Office of Inspector General's Boston office, U.S. Department 
  of Health and Human Services (HHS). I am pleased to testify at today's hearing 
  on the Federal role in protecting human subjects of medical research. My testimony 
  will focus on Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), the bodies that for more than 
  20 years have been charged under Federal law with ensuring human-subject protections. 
  With me is Laura C. McBride who was a key architect of these studies. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Mr. Chairman, the current system of protecting human subjects in medical research 
  is in need of major reform. This is a conclusion we emphasized in a series of 
  reports in June 1998. It is one we reiterate today. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Federal regulations were established requiring institutional 
  review boards to review research protocols. The review is required to ensure 
  human subjects are protected and are adequately informed of the risks and benefits 
  of participating in research. Within the Department of Health and Human Services 
  (HHS), both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes 
  of Health (NIH) have responsibilities for human-subject protections and oversight 
  of IRBs. NIH's Office for Protection from Research Risks, however, will soon 
  be relocated to the Office of the Secretary for HHS where responsibility will 
  transfer to the Assistant Secretary for Health. (For further background on IRBs 
  and their functions, see the primer at the end.) </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Background on Our Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>In mid-1997, we initiated a broad, systemic review in response to concerns 
  raised in a prior Office of Inspector General study. In that study, we examined 
  clinical trials involving four investigational medical devices, and, in each 
  case, discovered limitations related to IRB review. These concerned serious 
  matters such as the implantation of a device in three times the number of human 
  subjects specified in the IRB-approved research protocol, the initiation of 
  a research effort without the changes called for in the informed consent document, 
  and the continuation of a research project for six weeks beyond when the IRB 
  had suspended it. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We were also aware of concerns about the IRB system raised by others--for instance, 
  the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments and the General Accounting 
  Office. Both groups raised questions in their respective reports about the adequacy 
  of the IRB review process. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  In our most recent inquiry, we conducted a broad-based analysis of the IRB system 
  in order to gain an in-depth understanding of (1) the challenges facing IRBs 
  and (2) how the IRBs and the Federal government were meeting these challenges. 
  Toward that end, we developed a multi-faceted methodology drawing on many sources. 
  These included analyses of Federal records; an extensive literature review; 
  site visits to IRBs in 6 academic health centers; additional site visits accompanying 
  FDA inspectors; a survey on the electronic e-mail forum for those associated 
  with IRBs; and the systematic gathering of data from representatives of about 
  75 IRBs. This inquiry resulted in four reports issued in June 1998. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FINDINGS</strong></p>
<p>Our overriding finding in these reports was that the system of protections, 
  which has been so carefully developed over the years, is in need of reform. 
  We based this conclusion on six main findings. We reiterate them below. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>1. IRBs Face Major Changes in the Research Environment.</strong> </p>
<p>The research environment has undergone significant change in the 20 years since 
  the Federal IRB regulations were first established. In the late 1970s, research 
  was most often conducted by a single investigator at an academic medical center 
  under government funding. Today, almost the opposite is true. Many research 
  protocols are now multi-center trials involving thousands of subjects, numerous 
  investigators and institutions spread out across the country or even the world. 
  Each institution has little knowledge of what is occurring at other sites, if 
  problems have arisen, or even if other IRBs have called for changes in the protocol. 
  A greater proportion of research is funded by commercial sponsors. Research 
  is conducted increasingly at sites outside of academia where institutions can 
  more easily accommodate commercial sponsors desire for quick turnaround and 
  efficient research conduct. IRBs feel pressure to accommodate these sponsors 
  for whom time is money. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>2. IRBs Review Too Much, Too Quickly, with Too Little Expertise.</strong> 
</p>
<p>IRBs, composed mainly of volunteer members, are working under increasing strains. 
  More and more research is being conducted and, as a result, IRBs across the 
  country are inundated with protocols to review. Some of the sites we visited 
  are now reviewing more than 2,000 protocols annually. These IRBs are also being 
  flooded with adverse-event reports from the multi-center trials they oversee. 
  In an effort to cope with the increased workload, many IRBs are forced to rely 
  on a pre-assigned reviewer to examine and summarize research plans. In some 
  IRBs, unless one of the assigned reviewers raises a question or concern about 
  the research, the board engages in little or no discussion at its meeting. Some 
  IRBs have been able to increase the length of their meetings, but many others 
  are forced to squeeze more reviews into a fixed block of time. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Science is becoming increasingly complex and many IRBs find that they lack sufficient 
  scientific expertise on their boards or staffs to adequately assess protocols. 
  This is particularly evident for protocols involving advanced biomedical techniques--such 
  as genetic testing--that raise scientific issues as well as moral and ethical 
  questions that may not be apparent to the untrained eye. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>3. IRBs Conduct Minimal Continuing Review of Approved Research.</strong> 
</p>
<p>The IRBs' ongoing review of research can serve as an important safety net for 
  human subjects. The review involves a re-review of the protocol and an analysis 
  of the adverse event data to ensure the risk to subjects is minimal. However, 
  continuing review has become a low priority and is also often limited to a paper-based 
  review at many IRBs. Board members and officials we spoke with reported that 
  they seldom left the board room to visit the research site. Although many IRBs 
  would like to, few oversee the consent process. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>4. Neither IRBs nor HHS Devote Much Emphasis to Evaluating IRB Effectiveness. 
  </strong></p>
<p>IRBs have little basis for knowing how well they are accomplishing their mission 
  of protecting human subjects. Seldom do IRBs seek out feedback from human subjects 
  or their families. Federal oversight does not compensate for these deficiencies 
  as it, too, is not geared to evaluating effectiveness. OPRR's oversight is limited 
  almost entirely to an up-front assurance process. The assurance is a document 
  stating an institution's commitment to adhere to Federal requirements. Most 
  IRB staff we spoke with told us the assurance has little impact on IRB functioning. 
  The OPRR generally goes on-site only in instances of alleged breakdowns in IRB 
  protections. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  FDA oversight involves a more frequent on-site presence. However, their visits 
  focus almost entirely on IRB compliance with the procedural requirements set 
  forth in Federal regulations--such as attendance at review meetings, completeness 
  of minutes, and a review of the informed consent document. Such matters can 
  be important indicators of performance, but they give FDA little direct feedback 
  on the actual effectiveness of IRBs. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>5. IRBs Face Conflicts that Threaten Their Independence.</strong> </p>
<p>Research monies, particularly from commercial sponsors, is an important source 
  of revenue and/or prestige for most institutions. For example, at one of the 
  academic medical sites we visited, about 25 percent of the operating budget 
  (nearly $200 million) derives from research activities. This revenue source 
  is increasingly important as medical institutions are squeezed by managed-care 
  cost pressures. An important counterbalance to these sorts of pressures is the 
  perspectives of certain IRB members whose concerns are primarily in nonscientific 
  areas or who are not otherwise affiliated with the institution. However, Federal 
  regulations require only one of each. We found few such &quot;outside&quot; 
  members on the boards. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>6. IRBs and Their Institutions Provide Little Training for Investigators 
  and Board</strong> <strong>Members. </strong></p>
<p>The review process can involve complicated ethical issues and scientific questions. 
  Because of this, the education of board members is important. An understanding 
  of the issues is also essential for research investigators who, themselves, 
  initiate the informed consent process and interact directly with research subjects. 
  However, IRBs face significant obstacles which include not only insufficient 
  resources, but the reluctance of many investigators to participate in training 
  sessions. For new IRB members, their orientation to the role is seldom much 
  more than a stack of materials to read and on-the-job learning. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>We found the stresses on the IRB system to be significant enough for us to 
  make a number of strong recommendations to NIH/OPRR and FDA. The thrust of our 
  recommendations was for a more streamlined approach to providing human-subject 
  protections, both at the local and Federal levels. At the same time, we called 
  for a greater emphasis on accountability, performance, and results. Our recommendations 
  included a number of actions, many of which, in the near-term, could help to 
  address the vulnerabilities in the system. Some of our key recommendations were 
  as follows. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grant IRBs Greater Flexibility but Hold them More Accountable for 
    Results</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We called for eliminating or loosening a number of the procedural requirements 
  that Federal regulations currently impose on IRBs, to allow IRBs to meet the 
  significant challenges facing them. Greater flexibility could allow IRBs, for 
  example, to concentrate their limited time and resources on protocols involving 
  substantial risks to subjects. A <em>quid pro quo</em> for allowing IRBs greater 
  flexibility is an increased emphasis on accountability. Therefore, we recommended 
  regular, Federal performance-focused evaluations, whose results should be made 
  public, and more extensive representation on IRBs of nonscientific and noninstitutional 
  members. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reengineer the Federal Oversight Process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We suggested reorienting the Federal oversight system to focus on IRB performance. 
  In particular, NIH/OPRR should rework its assurance process so that it rests 
  essentially on an institutional attestation to conform to the Federal IRB requirements 
  in order to free scarce OPRR resources for on-site reviews and education sessions. 
  FDA should search for ways of revamping its inspections, so that they focus 
  less on narrow compliance matters and more on performance issues. FDA and OPRR 
  should combine efforts to require a registration process whereby IRBs would 
  submit basic descriptive information annually to HHS. This simple information 
  would allow Federal bodies to more effectively target their oversight and facilitate 
  dissemination of education materials. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengthen Continuing Protections for Research Subjects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The IRB system has long relied on an ethic of trust in the research community. 
  However, trust alone does not provide sufficient continuing protection. IRBs 
  need to be more aware of what is actually happening at the research site. For 
  example, they spend a significant amount of time reviewing and editing the language 
  of an informed consent document-- documents that can run up to 20 pages in length. 
  But, they know little about what actually happens in the interaction between 
  subject and investigator. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Another key mechanism of ensuring IRBs' meaningful reviews of approved research 
  is requiring certain outside sources to provide IRBs with valuable information. 
  Data Safety Monitoring Boards oversee many large-scale trials and continually 
  monitor the safety and efficacy of trials. Assessments of adverse events across 
  many disparate sites could help IRBs in their continuing reviews and reduce 
  their workload. Also, the FDA should provide IRBs with feedback on actions it 
  takes against investigators that are engaged in research at the IRBs' institution. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhance Education for Research Investigators and IRB Board Members</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Investigators are the ones who actually interact with and consent subjects. 
  Investigator education can help convey to investigators that along with the 
  considerable independence that they have in the research process, there exists 
  a significant responsibility to ensure human-subject protections. Investigators, 
  who are adequately sensitized to human-subject protections, can also serve to 
  minimize the need for regulatory intervention by the Federal government or by 
  IRBs themselves. Board members must also be trained on Federal requirements. 
  There are also many hidden ethical issues, particularly with the newer types 
  of research such as genetics, to which IRBs must be sensitive. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>AN UPDATE</strong> <br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>Our reports were released a year and a half ago. Since then there have been 
  some encouraging developments. But, the system of protections is still in jeopardy 
  and the need for strong federal action is still compelling. I'll close by elaborating 
  on each of these points. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong><u>Encouraging Developments</u></strong> <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Federal Initiatives.</strong> Progress has been made at the Federal 
  level, mainly in the activities of OPRR. In the year before our report was issued, 
  OPRR made only one on-site visit to a research institution. Since that time, 
  it has conducted a number of such visits, including one that resulted in the 
  temporary termination of all federally sponsored research at the Duke University 
  Medical Center. Some of their reviews represent the most probing and results-focused 
  inquires we have found of IRB performance, resulting in strong recommendations 
  to the IRBs. They are also taking a more active role in issuing further educational 
  outreach programs. NIH has issued guidance on the transmittal of information 
  to IRBs from data-safety boards used for trials it funds. </p>
<p><strong>Local Efforts.</strong> These Federal efforts, in particular the recent 
  shutdown at Duke University, in tandem with our reports and recent media attention 
  have served as a catalyst for change at IRBs and their institutions. Many IRB 
  representatives told us that they have been able to garner more support and 
  resources from their institutions. For example, an IRB Chair from a small community 
  research institution called to ask for 20 copies of our report in order to hold 
  their first-ever IRB training program. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>Professional Responses.</strong> There is a newly developed momentum 
  to certify IRB administrators and to develop a system for the private accreditation 
  of IRBs. Both of these efforts represent potentially important ways of raising 
  the bar in current IRB practice. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong><u>A System Still in Need of Reform</u></strong> <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  As encouraging as the above developments are, the system of protections provided 
  by IRBs remains in jeopardy. The same danger signs are widespread: expanded 
  workloads, quick reviews, threats to IRB independence, inadequate information, 
  and insufficient training. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Underlying pressures on IRBs continue to build and make it more difficult for 
  them to do their job: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increasing Commercialization of Research.</strong> One of the most 
    significant challenges IRBs face is the commercialization of research. Industry 
    is now the largest sponsor of clinical research in the country. With the increasing 
    prominence of industry comes the pressure for &quot;more, faster, better&quot; 
    IRB reviews. Investigators are expected to recruit subjects quickly and IRBs 
    are prodded for timely approvals of research protocols. IRBs' own institutions 
    are often focused on bringing in important research dollars from industry 
    sponsors. Many see thorough IRB review as a hurdle for their research efforts. 
    Hand in hand with the commercialization of research is the potential for conflicts 
    of interests. It is important to note that these conflicts are prominent in 
    all research settings-- academia, industry, and independent-- and from all 
    sources of funding. <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li><strong>Increasing Burden on IRB Members.</strong> IRB members, who are 
    often volunteers, are increasingly hard-pressed to devote the substantial 
    time required for IRB reviews. They are asked to review more projects, more 
    adverse event reports, many of which occur off site, and analyze complex ethical 
    issues raised by new areas of research (i.e., gene therapies and genetic testing). 
    All of this must be accomplished in a limited amount of time and while members 
    must balance competing responsibilities within their own institution. <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li><strong>Increasing Need for Subjects.</strong> Because of the growing amount 
    of research, investigators and research sponsors must find more and more human 
    subjects. The intensified quest for subjects heightens recruitment pressures 
    and leaves IRBs with many difficult questions to confront. Should they be 
    concerned about recruitment bonuses that sponsors give to investigators? What 
    about when investigators mine patient databases to find potential subjects? 
    Should investigators offer fees to physicians when the physicians refer their 
    patients as subjects? Few guidelines exist to help answer such questions. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Continued Need for Federal Action</u></strong> <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  A number of IRBs have enacted policies to help balance the pressures and minimize 
  conflicts of interest. However, most IRBs are hard-pressed to keep up with the 
  changing environment around them. Even if they are able to enact changes, they 
  may be at a competitive disadvantage to do so. Research sponsors often view 
  a burdensome and lengthy review process as a negative when deciding which sites 
  will conduct their research. Therefore, we need stronger Federal action. Federal 
  requirements can help safeguard adequate protections and establish a level-playing 
  field among research sites. Adequate protections would also help maintain the 
  integrity of the research enterprise. Just one unfortunate incident can damage 
  public confidence in research and, in turn, limit progress. </p>
<p>We continue to support all of the recommendations offered in our report. We 
  regard the following as particularly significant actions that Federal bodies 
  could take to shore up protections for human subjects. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>1. Maintain adequate Federal on-site presence.</strong> Visit by Federal 
  bodies can help reinforce to institutions the importance of IRBs. These visits, 
  particularly when conducted randomly, can serve to identify cracks in the local 
  IRB system before problems occur and serve as technical assistance. When unfortunate 
  incidents or complaints do arise, quick Federal responses can provide an outside 
  perspective on necessary corrective actions. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>2. Require investigator and IRB member education.</strong> The NIH should 
  require that institutions which receive funds for human-subject research under 
  the Public Health Service Act have a program to educate their investigators 
  about human-subject protections. Investigators, before participating in this 
  research, should be asked to sign a written attestation, similar to the one 
  required for FDA research, acknowledging their responsibility for human-subject 
  protections. Also, IRBs should be required to provide an orientation program 
  for new members and a continuing education program for all members before reviewing 
  research funded by NIH or under FDA purview. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>3. Require more extensive representation of nonscientific and noninstitutional 
  members on IRBs.</strong> The current requirement of only one nonscientific 
  and one noninstitutional member on an IRB is inadequate. This regulation can 
  be met with the selection of just one person; boards often have 15-20 members. 
  &quot;Independent&quot; members can provide an important counterbalance to institutional 
  interests and potential conflicts. They also provide an important voice which 
  may be attuned to the needs and sensitivities of the community. There should 
  be enough of these members to ensure their voices are heard. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  <strong>4. Require IRBs register with the Federal government.</strong> Current 
  estimates suggest the number of IRBs in the country is somewhere between 3,000 
  and 5,000. However, no one knows for certain how many IRBs there are, nor where 
  they are. IRBs should be required to register with the Federal government and 
  provide minimal descriptive information annually. Identifying information would 
  help target more effective oversight. Also, it would ensure that Federal bodies 
  be able to more efficiently disseminate important guidance and notices of upcoming 
  educational opportunities. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to underscore that the current system 
  of protections is supported by many conscientious researchers committed to protecting 
  human subjects and many competent, dedicated IRB staff. But the system they 
  function in has become brittle, with a few cracks. The effectiveness of the 
  system is in jeopardy. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  It is vital to reform this system so that human subjects receive adequate protections, 
  so that we can confidently recruit the participants we need for clinical research, 
  and so that the research process itself remains on a productive, fast track--one 
  that will improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and introduce new 
  and effective products and treatments for addressing them. It is particularly 
  important for the Federal government to exert leadership in triggering reform 
  because in an increasingly commercialized, competitive research environment, 
  the Federal government is best suited to establishing the level playing field 
  on which contending parties participate. <br
wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this most important topic. At this 
  time, I would be happy to answer any questions which you or the other members 
  of the Subcommittee may have. <br

          REVIEW BOARDS: THE BASICS</font></b>
        <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><b> 
        <p>What Do They Do?</p>
        </b> 
        <p>The responsibilities of IRBs fall into two main categories: initial 
          review and continuing review of research involving human subjects.</p>
        <p> <b>Initial Review: </b>IRBs review and approve a research plan before 
          the research is carried out. This review encompasses the research protocol, 
          the informed consent document to be signed by subjects, any advertisements 
          to be used in recruiting subjects, and other relevant documents. In 
          carrying out this review, the boards seek to ensure any risks subjects 
          may incur are warranted in relation to the anticipated benefits, that 
          informed consent documents clearly convey the risks and the true nature 
          of research, advertisements are not misleading, and the selection of 
          subjects is equitable and justified. IRBs focus much attention on the 
          informed consent document as it is the vehicle for providing information 
          to potential research subjects.</p>
        <p> <b>Continuing Review: </b>The continuing review process is multifaceted 
          and includes required reviews &quot;at an interval appropriate to the 
          degree of risk but not less than once per year.&quot; In addition to 
          this continuing review, study amendments and reports of unexpected adverse 
          experiences by subjects are received periodically and reviewed to ensure 
          that the risk-benefit ratio of the research has not changed and remains 
          acceptable.</p>
        <b> 
        <p>Why Were They Established?</p>
        </b> 
        <p>As public awareness and concern about the treatment of human subjects 
          in research increased, the need for additional review mechanisms was 
          evident. These concerns grew from stories of the abuse of subjects during 
          the World War II trials at Nuremberg, the promotional distribution of 
          thalidomide resulting in numerous children born with birth defects, 
          the administration of cancer cells to chronically ill and senile patients 
          at a hospital in New York, and others. A 1966 article by Henry Beecher 
          brought prominent attention to human research abuses in medical schools 
          and hospitals citing 22 cases involving highly questionable ethics. 
          The formal requirements for the establishment of IRBs were outlined 
          in regulations stemming from the National Research Act of 1974 and in 
          FDA regulations issued in 1981.</p>
        <b> 
        <p>Where Are They Located?</p>
        </b> 
        <p>An estimated 3,000-5,000 IRBs can be found across the country. They 
          are most commonly associated with hospitals and academic centers. Boards 
          also exist in managed-care organizations, government agencies (such 
          as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, 
          and State governments), or as for-profit entities that are independent 
          of the institutions in which the research takes place.</p>
        <b> 
        <p>How Are They Organized?</p>
        </b> 
        <p>Federal regulations require that boards have at least five members 
          with varying backgrounds. At least one member must have primarily scientific 
          interests, one must have primarily nonscientific interests, and one 
          must be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution in which the IRB 
          resides. A quorum, with at least one member whose interests are primarily 
          nonscientific present, is needed for voting.</p>
        <b> 
        <p>How Does the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Oversee 
          Them?</p>
        </b> </font>
        <p><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1">Two agencies within HHS share 
          responsibility for IRB oversight: the Office for Protection from Research 
          Risks (OPRR) in NIH and the FDA. The OPRR’s main tool for oversight 
          is the assurance document. Any institution that intends to conduct HHS-funded 
          research must have an assurance on file with OPRR. The assurance is 
          a written statement of an institution’s requirements and procedures 
          for its IRB and human subject protections. Institutions conducting multiple 
          HHS-supported studies can apply for a multiple project assurance (MPA) 
          which can be renewed every five years. Institutions with smaller HHS-funded 
          workloads, however, use a single project assurance (SPA) for each such 
          project it conducts. The OPRR also conducts a small number of site-visits. 
          The FDA’s main mechanism for IRB oversight is the inspection process. 
          The FDA also inspects research sponsors and scientists (known as research
