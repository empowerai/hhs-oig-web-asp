<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I am Joseph E. Vengrin, Assistant Inspector
General for Audit Operations and Financial Statement Activities of the
Department of Health and Human Services. With me today is Ed Meyers, Director,
Information Systems Audits and Advanced Techniques. We share the Committee's
concerns regarding the security of Government information systems, and
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on the vulnerability of Medicare
claim processing systems.
<p>In conducting annual audits of the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) financial statements, which are required by the Government Management
Reform Act of 1994, we contract with independent public accounting (IPA)
firms to express an opinion on the financial statements and report on internal
control deficiencies. As part of the body of work underpinning these audits,
the IPA firms perform various internal control tests of the Medicare program,
including its automated systems. The purpose of these tests is to determine
the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures to be performed during
each year's audit.
<p>Strong internal controls over Medicare systems are essential to ensure
the integrity, confidentiality, and reliability of critical data and to
reduce the risk of errors, fraud, and other illegal acts. However, since
fiscal year (FY) 1996, when we first began the financial statement audits,
we have noted continuing material internal control weaknesses in the systems,
particularly those operated by contractors. Material weaknesses are defined
as serious deficiencies in internal controls that can lead to material
misstatements of amounts reported in subsequent financial statements unless
corrective actions are taken. Also, such weaknesses could allow (1) unauthorized
access to and disclosure of sensitive information, (2) malicious changes
that could interrupt data processing or destroy data files, (3) improper
Medicare payments, or (4) disruption of critical operations. My statement
today will summarize the significant problems noted in the FY 2000 financial
statement audit.

<p><b>Medicare Automated Systems</b></center>

<p>By way of background, the Medicare program provides health insurance
for 39.5 million elderly and disabled Americans at a cost of about $215
billion in FY 2000. The program is administered by HCFA, the largest component
of the Department of Health and Human Services. Medicare services are provided
through either fee-for-service arrangements or managed care plans.
<p>HCFA relies on extensive computerized operations at both its central
office and contractor sites to administer the Medicare program and to process
and account for Medicare expenditures. The HCFA central office systems
maintain administrative data, such as Medicare enrollment, eligibility,
and paid claims data, and process all payments to health care providers
for managed care. The fee-for-service claim processing system, the Department's
most complex and decentralized system, is operated with the help of more
than 50 contractors located throughout the country. There are two types
of contractors: Intermediaries process claims from institutions, such as
hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, filed under Part A of the Medicare
program, while carriers process Part B claims from other health care providers,
such as physicians and medical equipment suppliers. These contractors and
their data centers use several "shared" systems to process and pay provider
claims. Currently, each intermediary uses one of two shared systems, and
each carrier uses one of four shared systems. All of the shared systems
interface with HCFA's Common Working File system to obtain authorization
to pay claims and to coordinate Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. This
fee-for-service network processed over 890 million claims totaling $173.6
billion during FY 2000.
<p>Generally, Medicare claim processing begins when a health care provider
submits a claim to a contractor. The claim is entered into a shared system
which captures, edits, and prices the claim. Once the claim has passed
all shared system edits and has been priced, it is submitted to the Common
Working File for validation, verification of beneficiary eligibility, and
payment authorization.

<p><b>Systems Control Weaknesses</b></center>

<p>As we have previously reported, the underlying internal control environment
for Medicare claim processing operations needs substantial improvement.
Our FY 2000 audit identified numerous weaknesses in general controls, which
involve access controls, entity-wide security programs, application development
and program change controls, segregation of duties, operating system software,
and service continuity. General controls affect the integrity of all applications
operating within a single data processing facility and are critical to
ensuring the reliability, confidentiality, and availability of data.
<p>Of 124 general control weaknesses identified, 115 were found at the
sampled Medicare contractor sites and 9 were found at the HCFA central
office. About 80 percent of these weaknesses involved three types of controls:
access controls, entity-wide security programs, and systems software.
<p><b>Access Controls</b>
<p>Access controls ensure that critical systems assets are physically safeguarded,
that logical (e.g., electronic) access to sensitive computer programs and
data is granted only when authorized and appropriate, and that only authorized
staff and computer processes access sensitive data in an appropriate manner.
Weaknesses in such controls can compromise the integrity of program data
and increase the risk that data may be inappropriately used and/or disclosed.
<p>Access control weaknesses represented the largest problem area. The
most widespread weaknesses concerned administration of the controls themselves.
At several contractors, passwords were not properly administered, systems
security software was not implemented effectively, or access privileges
were not reviewed frequently enough to ensure their continuing validity.
We also reported that controls did not effectively prevent access to sensitive
data. For instance, computer programmers and other technical support staff
had inappropriate access to the data files used in the fee-for-service
claim process, such as beneficiary history files. Under these conditions,
the Common Working File system was vulnerable to inappropriate use.
<p>At some contractors, programmers had inappropriate access to system
logs; this provided an opportunity to conceal improper actions and obviated
the logs' effectiveness as "detect" controls. At one contractor, the computer
operator could override installation system security precautions when restarting
the mainframe computer system. We also noted weaknesses in controls over
access to sensitive facilities and media within those facilities. For example,
at one contractor, inappropriate individuals had access to the computer
center's command post. At another, the computer production control area
was not secured during normal business hours.
<p><b><i>Penetration Tests. </i></b>As part of their assessment of access
controls, IPA firms performed low-level internal and external penetration
testing at eight Medicare contractor sites. The purpose of this testing
was to identify real and postulated security risks to, and vulnerabilities
of, the information systems. A variety of common penetration testing procedures
revealed additional access control risks at certain contractor sites. When
dial-up connections were made, computer systems permitted an excessive
number of failed remote access log-in attempts before disconnection and
disclosed more information about themselves than necessary. In addition,
inadequate password protections permitted unauthorized access to certain
computer systems, and insufficient controls over print output queues permitted
unauthorized "read" access to sensitive data. Such weaknesses increase
the risk of unauthorized remote access to sensitive Medicare systems and
data.
<p><b>Entity-Wide Security Programs</b>
<p>Entity-wide security programs ensure that security threats are identified,
risks are assessed, control techniques are developed, and management oversight
is applied to ensure the overall effectiveness of security measures. These
programs typically include policies on how and which sensitive duties should
be separated to avoid conflicts of interest and stipulate what types of
background checks are needed during the hiring process. Entity-wide security
programs afford management the opportunity to provide appropriate direction
and oversight of the design, development, and operation of critical systems
controls. Inadequacies in these programs can result in inadequate access
controls and software change controls affecting mission-critical operations.
<p>We reported that several contractor sites lacked fully documented, comprehensive
entity-wide security plans that addressed all aspects of an adequate security
program. Inadequate risk assessments, a lack of comprehensive security
awareness programs, and inadequate policies were among the weaknesses noted
at the contractors. At the HCFA central office, we found no security assessment
of, or security plans for, significant application systems; insufficient
security oversight of the Medicare contractors; no formal process to remove
system access of terminated HCFA employees and contractors; and deficiencies
in the management review and approval process.
<p><b>Systems Software Controls</b>
<p>Systems software controls help to prevent unauthorized individuals from
using software to read, modify, or delete critical information and programs.
Systems software is a set of programs designed to operate and control the
processing activities of computer equipment. Generally, it supports a variety
of applications that may run on the same computer hardware. Some systems
software can change data and programs on files without leaving an audit
trail.
<p>Weaknesses in systems software controls related to managing routine
changes to the software to ensure their appropriate implementation and
configuring operating system controls to ensure their effectiveness. Such
problems could weaken critical controls over access to sensitive Medicare
data files and operating system programs.
<p><b>Shared System Weaknesses</b>
<p>Since FY 1997, we have reported that the Medicare data centers have
inappropriate access to the source code of the Fiscal Intermediary Shared
System, which is used by certain Medicare contractors. This unresolved
weakness was expanded this year to include the Common Working File system,
which all shared systems use to obtain authorization to pay claims. Access
to source code renders the Medicare claim processing system vulnerable
to abuse, such as the implementation of unauthorized programs and the implementation
of local changes to shared system programs. While HCFA requires contractors
to restrict local changes to emergency situations, local changes are often
not subjected to the same controls that exist in the standard change control
process.
<center>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></center>

<p>In summary, we remain concerned that inadequate internal controls over
Medicare operations leave the program vulnerable to loss of funds, unauthorized
access to and disclosure of sensitive medical information, malicious changes
that could interrupt data processing or destroy data files, improper payments,
or disruption of critical operations. Further, because of weaknesses in
the contractors' entity-wide security structures, HCFA has no assurance
that information systems controls are adequate and operating effectively.
While all of these weaknesses are troubling, we do not know whether the
resulting vulnerabilities have been exploited in terms of compromised medical
<br>information, fictitious Medicare claims, diversion of taxpayer dollars,
or some other type of fraud or abuse by an "insider" or a hacker.
<p>What most concerns us are the continuing problems identified in access
and entity-wide security controls. HCFA must ensure that Medicare contractors
develop corrective action plans that not only address identified weaknesses
but also attempt to determine the fundamental causes of the weaknesses.
Among the efforts planned and underway by HCFA is an improved corrective
action process. We expect that HCFA's testimony will fully address that
process, as well as other short- and long-term actions to shore up information
systems controls. We urge HCFA to sustain its focus on these critical internal
controls. Furthermore, HCFA and the Medicare contractors should routinely
conduct penetration testing to ensure the integrity of their information
technology environment.
<p>We in the Office of Inspector General will continue to work with HCFA
to overcome the persistent risks to the security of the Medicare program.
For example, as required by the Government Information Security Reform
Act (GISRA) of 2000, we have begun an<b> </b>independent evaluation of
HCFA's security program. Our evaluation will incorporate the results of
several efforts: the internal control testing conducted during our annual
financial statement audits, our ongoing work to ensure compliance with
Presidential Decision Directive 63, our additional work focused on access
and entity-wide security controls at selected Medicare contractors, information
systems reviews (known as Statement on Audit Standards 70 examinations)
conducted by IPA firms under contract with HCFA, and other security assessments
performed by consultants for HCFA.
<p>I will be happy to discuss the extent of our GISRA work, as well as
any other matters, in response to your questions.
