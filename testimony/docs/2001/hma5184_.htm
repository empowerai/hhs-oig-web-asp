<hr size="1">Good Morning, Madam Chairman. Human tissue is an important
source of medical treatment, benefitting thousands of Americans every year.
However, concerns have been raised about current practices and the future
developments of this field.
<p>Last year, more than 750,000 pieces of human skin, bone, and heart valves
were distributed for transplantation. This does not include eyes and other
types of human cells or tissue. It came from over 20,000 donors and their
families who so generously made this important gift at the time of a loved
one's death. These families and a relatively small number of tissue banks,
who procure, process, store, and distribute tissue, have been the foundation
of this medical service for many years. Recently, however, the tissue banking
industry has expanded and become more complex. Tissue is being put to new
uses, and processing has grown more sophisticated. Entrepreneurial firms
have stepped in to develop and market new products and treatments from
human tissue. Unfortunately, standards of practice have not kept pace with
this growth and development.
<p>Earlier this year, the Office of Inspector General issued two reports
on tissue banking. We have provided copies of both reports to the members
of this Subcommittee. Our reports address the adequacy of the quality assurance
oversight mechanisms for this industry and the extent to which donor families
can make informed decisions about consenting to donation. I will discuss
both these facets of tissue banking and offer recommendations to improve
them.
<p><b>OVERSIGHT OF TISSUE BANKING</b>
<p>External oversight of the tissue banking industry is currently limited,
although recent actions by the Food and Drug Administration have improved
the situation. Regulations now under development will result in even stronger,
and much needed, supervision of the industry. Portions of the industry
have developed their own accreditation system, and two States license and
inspect tissue banks. However, as of now, serious gaps remain.
<p><b>The Food and Drug Administration</b>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) focuses on preventing transmission
of communicable disease by requiring donor screening and testing. No new
cases of disease transmission through human tissue have been identified
since the FDA's initial regulation of tissue in 1993. This absence of new
cases points to significant strengths and accomplishments in the current
system. Nevertheless, we identified situations that show the need for continued
vigilance and monitoring. For example, FDA inspectors have found serious
deficiencies in tissue banks' screening and testing practices where they
have conducted inspections. It is reasonable to believe that similar problems
exist where they have not conducted them.
<p><b>Inspections.</b> FDA has conducted 188 inspections of 118 tissue
banks since 1993. However, at the time of our study some tissue banks had
never been inspected by FDA. We found at least 36 tissue banks that have
never been inspected, out of 154 tissue establishments that we identified.
FDA has indicated that because regulation of tissue banks is an unfunded
mandate, it has had to borrow resources from other programs to carry out
these inspections.
<p>FDA lacks a prescribed cycle for reinspection of tissue banks. At the
time of our study, out of 118 tissue banks that FDA had inspected, 68 were
inspected only once. Due to limited resources, the agency has established
a priority list for follow-up inspections, focusing on banks with the most
serious deficiencies.
<p>Since we issued our report, FDA has begun inspecting all known tissue
banks.
<p><b>Registration.</b> At the time of our study, the number and location
of tissue banks were unknown. Information was unavailable about the number
of tissue banks in operation and the products they produce and distribute.
Subsequently, on January 19 of this year, FDA published a final rule requiring
the registration and listing of all tissue banks.
<p><b>Quality Control.</b> FDA has also been developing two additional
regulations that would provide stronger assurances regarding the handling
and use of human tissues. The first, on good tissue manufacturing practices,
was issued as a draft on January 8 of this year. The closing date for public
comments was May 8. The second, on suitability of donors and tissue products,
had been issued as a draft rule in September, 1999. The comment period
was extended through July of last year, and comments are now being analyzed.
The scope of FDA's current regulation is limited to donor screening and
testing to prevent transmission of HIV and Hepatitis.
<p><b>The American Association of Tissue Banks</b>
<p>The American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) conducts a voluntary
accreditation program. It currently accredits 58 tissue banks. Accreditation
addresses not only donor screening and testing practices, but operational
and organizational aspects, such as qualifications of tissue bank personnel
and banks' safety practices, equipment testing, facilities, labeling, and
quality assurance programs. Some banks have failed to meet basic standards
of the AATB and have been denied accreditation.
<p>Seeking accreditation is purely voluntary. We identified 90 tissue banks
that are not accredited. These banks are under no obligation to meet the
standards or policies set by the association, and for many banks there
is no incentive to seek accreditation.
<p><b>States</b>
<p>New York and Florida are the only two States to license and inspect
tissue banks. In addition to screening and testing, these States require
banks to report adverse incidents. They also address areas such as how
tissue is recovered and tracked, emergency procedures, equipment standards,
conflict of interest, community involvement, labeling standards, laboratory
testing, and disposition of unused tissue. A few States, including California,
Georgia, and Maryland, require tissue banks to be licensed by the State.
<p><b>Overall</b>
<p>Until FDA's proposed rule on good tissue practices is finalized, tissue
banks have no external requirements for quality and handling of tissue
if they are not accredited by AATB or licensed by New York or Florida.
Of the 154 tissue banks we identified, 67 are neither accredited by AATB
nor inspected by Florida or New York.
<p><b>Recommendations Regarding FDA Oversight</b>
<p>In our reports, we called upon the Food and Drug Administration to take
a number of steps to ensure the safety and quality of tissue transplanted
in this country. Needless to say, FDA should move forward with pending
oversight efforts. As noted earlier, we recommended that FDA set a realistic,
yet aggressive, date by which it would complete an initial inspection of
all tissue banks and determine an appropriate minimum cycle for tissue
bank inspections.
<p>We also believe FDA should examine whether there are areas in which
oversight can be coordinated with other entities.<b> </b>We called on FDA
to work with States and professional associations to determine in what
areas, if any, oversight activities could be coordinated. If this approach
were appropriate, it could help maximize agency resources and reduce redundant
regulatory burden on tissue banks.
<p><b>DONOR CONSENT</b>
<p><b>Expectations of Donor Families</b>
<p>Donor families have some basic expectations about their decision to
donate a loved one's tissue. These relate to the way the donated tissue
is used and to the respect of the donor, even after death.
<p><b>Intended Use and Supply.</b> Families expect that their loved one's
tissue will be used to improve the lives of people with medical needs,
either through transplantation or medical research. For many families,
donation is seen as a way of creating something positive from the death
of their loved one. However, concerns have been raised that some tissue
may be used for purposes other than those intended by the donor. For example,
donors may intend or believe that their skin will be used for the treatment
of burn victims. However, in some cases it might be used for elective cosmetic
surgery. Some believe that this might contribute to a shortage of skin
for essential medical uses. However, there is no national system for tracking
the availability and use of tissue and determining where there may be a
shortage. It is not clear how much tissue goes for cosmetic uses or whether
such use contributes to a shortage.
<p>After we began our inspection, both the American Association of Tissue
Banks and the American Burn Association published results of surveys which
they took to determine the adequacy of the supply of skin for burn surgery.
Their reports indicate that supplies were tight, with surgeons having to
delay or make do with alternative treatments in some cases. However, these
surveys were not detailed enough to know if any burn victims were unable
to get the treatment they needed, or if any supply shortages occurred as
a result of diverting skin to lower priority usages.
<p><b>Respect.</b> Families we talked to emphasized their desire that the
donor will be treated with respect<b> </b>during the surgical processes
of tissue recovery, during funeral preparations, and while tissue is processed,
distributed, and transplanted. Once it has been processed, however, tissue
is treated more like a commodity than a donation. The packages in which
human tissue is supplied--bottles, vials, containers shrink-wrapped in
plastic--resemble many other medical supplies. The packaging does not indicate
the special nature of the donation that underlies the enclosed materials.
Nor do marketing materials indicate the nature of the donation. These product
brochures look like typical medical supply catalogues, contributing to
a perception that tissue is no different than any other supply. Neither
of these practices reinforces the respect that donor families expect to
be given for the donated gift of human tissue.
<p><b>The Process of Obtaining Consent and Donations</b>
<p>Current practices in requesting consent raise concerns about what information
is provided to families and how this is done.
<p><b>Circumstances and Timing. </b>Tissue banks must obtain consent for
donation within hours following the death of a loved one. The recent, often
sudden and unexpected, death of a loved one means that families may be
upset at the time they are asked for consent to donation. In the face of
sudden tragedy, they may simply be unable to understand detailed information
about a topic as complex as tissue donation. Because of the circumstances,
detailed discussion about multiple aspects of tissue donation and tissue
banking--recovery, processing, distribution, commercial relationships--may
go well beyond the capacity of families to comprehend what they are hearing.
<p>At the same time, families may not wish to receive detailed information
about tissue banking. Families may want to consent to donation, but do
not want to hear specific details about the invasive surgical procedures
associated with recovering tissues. As the mother of one tissue donor told
us, "I really didn't need any more information than what was provided;
frankly, I wouldn't have been able to deal with much more at that point."
At the same time, however, much information needs to be communicated to
the family at the time of consent; at a minimum, authorization for removal
of specific tissues is required. Families also must agree whether the tissue
may be used only for transplantation, or for other uses such as research
and education.
<p><b>Request by Telephone. </b>Tissue banks often request consent over
the telephone, rather than in person. In most cases, tissue banks make
these requests after the family has left the hospital. Tissue bank staff
told us that it is more productive to give the family time to return to
the familiar surroundings of home, rather than the coldness of a hospital.
<p><b>Staff Supervision. </b>Many tissue banks rely on staff from other
organizations to obtain consent. These external requestors could be staff
from organ procurement organizations, telephone triage agencies, hospital
staff, chaplains, or social workers.
<p>Those banks that make the request directly are able to train and monitor
the performance of their own staff. However, training and oversight are
much more limited for external requestors. Those training programs tend
to be shorter, and few tissue banks provide continuing education or follow-up
training to these requestors. Tissue banks also do less direct monitoring
of these requestors' performance, and we found that few tissue banks actively
assess the performance of external requestors.
<p><b>Written Materials. </b>Tissue banks provide donor families with little
written material at the time of donation.<b> </b>Few tissue banks routinely
give families a copy of the form that they have signed, giving their consent
to donation. The consent form is more than a receipt. It is the legal authorization
governing the removal of tissue and specifying purposes for which the tissue
may be used.
<p>Following donation, it is general practice for tissue banks to send
families a letter thanking them for the gift and expressing condolences.
Aside from this letter, tissue banks provide little additional written
information to families about tissue use, processing, or other entities
with whom they have financial arrangements.
<p>Because, as we noted above, families may not understand everything that
is told to them at the time of donation, more information may be beneficial
at a later date, so that the family could refer to it as desired.
<p><b>Standards for Obtaining Consent</b>
<p>Until recently, standards governing how families are approached and
what they are told about tissue donation have been sparse. Neither Federal
law, such as the National Organ Transplant Act, nor the individual States'
Anatomical Gift Acts address what information tissue banks should provide
in obtaining consent. However, some initial progress toward development
of standards has occurred.
<p><b>Donor Family Advocates.</b> Last Fall, the National Donor Family
Council proposed key elements that should be included when tissue banks
approach families for donation. These elements include:
<ul>
<li>
Explanation of how tissue is recovered, processed, stored and distributed;</li>

<li>
Explanation that the tissue may be used or modified for transplantation;</li>

<li>
Explanation that the family may limit or restrict the use of tissue; and</li>

<li>
Requirements that the consent form be reviewed with families and that a
copy be offered to the family.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tissue Industry.</b> Also in the midst of our inquiry last Fall, The
American Association of tissue Banks, the Association of Organ Procurement
Organizations, and the Eye Bank Association of America issued a joint statement
that addresses elements of informed consent. This statement encourages
the provision of information to families including:
<ul>
<li>
Identification of specific tissues that are being requested for donation;</li>

<li>
Explanation that retrieved tissues may be used for transplantation, therapy,
research, or education; and</li>

<li>
A general description of the recovery process.</li>
</ul>
The statement also recognizes that families may seek additional information
about donation. If so, additional explanations should be provided to address
such issues as:
<ul>
<li>
The possibility that the gift may take a different form than originally
recovered;</li>

<li>
Transplantation may include reconstructive and aesthetic surgery; and</li>

<li>
Multiple organizations (non profit and/or for profit) may be involved in
facilitating the gift.</li>
</ul>
The full text of the statements from both of these groups is in our reports.
<p><b>Recommendations Regarding Donor Consent</b>
<p>We have called upon the Department of Health and Human Services to provide
assistance to efforts to develop standards. For example, we encourage the
Health Resources and Services Administration (which houses the Division
of Transplantation) to work with donor family groups representing the tissue
banking industry. We believe that they could help these organizations develop
guidelines for conveying information to families about tissue donation.
We also have called upon the Health Care Financing Administration to address
informed consent for tissue donation through its oversight of the organ
procurement system.
<p>Although the Department can provide guidance and assistance, the basic
responsibility for ensuring that families are informed about all aspects
of tissue donation must rest with the tissue banks themselves. The tissue
banks and their staff and contractors are the ones who interact with the
donor family at the time of requesting consent.
<p>Because each case and each situation is unique, those who interact with
families to request donation must have the flexibility to recognize the
individual concerns present at that moment in time and to adapt their discussion
to the unique needs and responses of each donor family. We do believe,
however, that some essential precepts should govern the interaction that
tissue banks have with families.
<p><b>Written Materials.</b> First, at the time of obtaining consent, tissue
banks should provide families with written materials that provide fuller
disclosure about the uses of tissue and the nature of the gift.<b> </b>Tissue
banks should give written material to families at the time the banks ask
for consent to donation, or in the days immediately following the request.
The material would serve as one way to supplement the information that
requestors give the family during their conversation about donation. At
the same time, it would provide requestors with flexibility to adapt that
conversation to the unique needs and responses of each donor family. At
a minimum, this material should include:
<ul>
<li>
A copy of the signed consent form;</li>

<li>
Written material on how to follow up with the tissue bank if concerns arise;</li>

<li>
A full description of the uses to which donated tissue may be put; and</li>

<li>
A list and description of other companies and entities with which the bank
has relationships for processing and distributing tissue.</li>
</ul>
<b>Recognition of Donors. </b>Second, tissue processors and distributors
should ensure that information accompanying their product clearly indicates
it is derived from donated human tissue. Such a step would require only
minor changes in packaging and marketing materials. However, it would go
a long way towards showing ongoing respect for the donor, the family, and
the gift of donation. Tissue banks should:
<ul>
<li>
Indicate clearly on all tissue packaging that the contents are derived
from donated human tissue; and</li>

<li>
Indicate clearly on all marketing and informational material that these
products are derived from donated human tissue.</li>
</ul>
<b>Conduct of Requestors. </b>Third, tissue banks should foster greater
accountability for the performance of those who request consent for donation.&nbsp;
Responsibility for ensuring that requestors are providing accurate, sensitive,
and appropriate information rests with tissue banks and the processors
with whom they work. These organizations should:
<ul>
<li>
Ensure that requestors--both from their own organizations and elsewhere--are
fully and appropriately trained;</li>

<li>
Provide continuing education for requestors; and</li>

<li>
Conduct an ongoing assessment of requestor performance to ensure they are
providing full and accurate information to families approached for donation.</li>
</ul>
<b>Public Disclosure. </b>Fourth, the tissue banking industry should work
with groups representing donor families to explore a process for periodic
public disclosure about tissue banks' financing. Such disclosure would
respond to family and general public concerns about knowing the sources
of funding for tissue banks and other entities with which the bank has
financial arrangements. The examination would consider whether financial
information would be useful as part of a package of information provided
to donor families. The examination would consider:
<ul>
<li>
What types and how much financial information would be useful for families
and individuals making decisions about donation;</li>

<li>
The advantages and disadvantages of disclosure, including the potential
impact of financial disclosure on donation;</li>

<li>
Whether the information should be provided in all cases, or only if requested
by a family; and</li>

<li>
The content, style, and format of disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<b>Supply and Usage.</b> The tissue banking industry should refine and
periodically repeat its surveys regarding the availability of tissue. The
refinements should provide more precise information about the extent to
which patients' needs are being met. Tissue banks should also try to obtain
more information about the uses made of the tissue that passes through
their operations. This will enable them to provide better information on
this subject to donors. Finally, some upgrading of inventory measurement
and control systems should be adopted within the industry, probably through
automated data systems, in order to allow for more effective sharing of
tissues among tissue banks to meet situations where supplies are low and
needs are critical.
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>Both FDA and the tissue banking industry have made progress toward improving
the consent and donation processes and quality assurance oversight mechanisms
for processing human tissue. But gaps remain. The recent gains need to
be rounded out and solidified. Standards of operation still have to catch
up with the growth and complexity of this health care sector. I hope the
findings and recommendations in our reports will be helpful in this regard.
