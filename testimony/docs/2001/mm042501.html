<br><b>Improper Payments</b>
<p><b>Statement of</b>
<br><b>Michael F. Mangano</b>
<br><b>Acting Inspector General</b>
<p><b>April 25, 2001</b>
<p><b>Office of Inspector General</b>
<br><b>Department of Health and Human Services</b>
<br>
<hr>Good morning Mr. Chairman.&nbsp; My name is Michael F. Mangano.&nbsp;
I am the Acting Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS).&nbsp; It is my pleasure to be here today to give you an
update on our work with regard to improper payments in Departmental programs.
<p>Today, I will provide an overview of the types of payment errors revealed
by our most recent Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) audit.&nbsp;
Over the past five years, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has
undertaken audits of Medicare's fee-for-service claims to estimate the
extent of payments that did not comply with Medicare laws and regulations.
These payment errors, comprised of improper provider billings, make up
the largest category of inappropriate payments in the Medicare program.&nbsp;
These errors can include simple billing mistakes as well as fraudulent
billings.&nbsp; We continue to believe that most health care providers
do their best to provide high quality care and are honest in their dealings
with Medicare.&nbsp; At the same time, we must be concerned about all errors,
even those which are totally innocent.&nbsp; Our annual measurement of
Medicare payment errors not only allows HCFA to focus on the areas where
increased compliance is needed, but also enables HCFA to identify approaches
to building a better Medicare program.
<p>I will also describe instances of specific inappropriate payments made
as a result of the complex, antiquated, and incompatible technology environment
in which Departmental programs operate.&nbsp; These examples include Medicare
and Medicaid payments made on behalf of deceased or incarcerated beneficiaries,
as well as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) payments made
to fugitive felons.&nbsp; Taken together, these problems indicate systemic
vulnerabilities which could lead to much more serious losses of funds if
not remedied.
<p><b>MEDICARE PAYMENT ERROR RATE</b>
<p>We recently released our report <i>Improper Fiscal Year 2000 Medicare
Fee-for-Service Payments</i> (A-17-00-02000) in which we present the results
of our review of Fiscal Year (FY) 2000 Medicare fee-for-service claims.&nbsp;
Based on our statistical sample, we estimate that improper Medicare benefit
payments made during FY 2000 totaled $11.9 billion, or about 6.8 percent
of the $173.6 billion in processed fee-for-service payments reported by
HCFA.&nbsp; It is important to note that this is an error rate estimate
and not a fraud estimate.&nbsp; These improper payments could fall on a
continuum anywhere from simple inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and
abuse.
<p>When the sampled claims were submitted for payment to Medicare contractors,
they contained no visible errors.&nbsp; We found that the contractors'
claim processing controls were generally adequate for: (1) ensuring beneficiary
and provider Medicare eligibility; (2) pricing claims based on information
submitted; and (3) ensuring that the services as billed were allowable
under Medicare rules and regulations.&nbsp; However, their controls were
not effective in detecting the types of errors we found.&nbsp; Instead,
reviews of patient records by medical professionals detected 92 percent
of the improper payments.&nbsp; Our historical analysis of payment errors
from FY 1996 through FY 2000 identified four major payment error categories:
medically unnecessary services, unsupported services, coding errors, and
noncovered services.
<p><b>Medically unnecessary services</b>, the largest error category this
year, amounted to $5.1 billion in improper payments.&nbsp; This category
covers situations in which the medical review staff found enough documentation
in the medical records to make an informed decision that the medical services
or products received were not medically necessary.&nbsp; The following
is an example of services that were determined not medically necessary:
<ul>
<li>
A physician was paid $3,305 for 40 hypnotherapy sessions with an Alzheimer's
patient.&nbsp; The medical records stated that the patient was neither
attentive nor cooperative during the initial mental status exam.&nbsp;
Since the patient could not participate in that exam, the medical reviewer
determined that hypnotherapy treatment was not medically necessary, reasonable,
or appropriate for a 95 year old Alzheimer's patient.</li>
</ul>
<b>Unsupported services</b> represented the largest error category in three
of the last 5 years.&nbsp; In FY 2000, they accounted for an estimated
$4.3 billion in improper payments. Such services include those where there
is insufficient documentation to determine the patient's overall condition,
diagnosis, and extent of services performed ($2.3 billion) or where there
was no documentation to support the services provided ($2 billion). An
example of unsupported services follows:
<ul>
<li>
A hospital was paid $722 for outpatient radiation therapy services.&nbsp;
The medical records contained no documentation to support the provision
of these services.&nbsp; After repeated unsuccessful attempts to obtain
such documentation, the claim was denied.</li>
</ul>
<b>Coding errors</b> represented $1.7 billion in improper payments (the
net of upcoding and downcoding errors). For most of the coding errors found,
the medical reviewers determined that the documentation submitted by providers
supported a lower reimbursement code. Physician and inpatient Prospective
Payment System (PPS) claims accounted for over 90 percent of the coding
errors over the 5 years reviewed. An example of incorrect coding includes:
<ul>
<li>
A hospital was paid $19,452 for providing a diagnostic related group service
to a patient admitted with a chronic inflamation of the membrane lining
the abdominal wall.&nbsp; The principal diagnosis code was shown as another
infection. The medical reviewers concluded that the diagnosis code should
have been related to an infection due to a dialysis catheter. As a result,
$7,125 was denied.</li>
</ul>
<b>Noncovered services and other errors</b> consistently constituted the
smallest error category.&nbsp; Noncovered services are defined as those
that Medicare will not reimburse because the services do not meet Medicare
reimbursement rules and regulations.&nbsp; Such services include most routine
physical examinations; eye and ear examinations to prescribe or to fit
glasses or hearing aids; and, most routine foot care.
<p>Since we developed the first error rate for FY 1996, HCFA has closely
monitored Medicare payments and has instituted appropriate corrective actions.&nbsp;
The HCFA has also worked with provider groups to clarify reimbursement
rules and to impress upon healthcare providers the importance of fully
documenting services.&nbsp; Additional initiatives on the part of the Congress,
HCFA, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General have
focused resources on preventing, detecting, and eliminating fraud and abuse.&nbsp;
All of these efforts, we believe, have contributed to reducing the improper
payment rate by almost half -- from $23 billion, or about 14 percent of
Medicare program expenditures, in FY 1996 to $11.9 billion, or about 6.8
percent of the $173.6 billion in Medicare payments, in FY 2000.
<p>The decrease in improper payments has had a positive effect on Medicare's
financial situation.&nbsp; From 1991 to 1996, the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) reported that Medicare's rate of inflation averaged 10.9 percent
per year.&nbsp; In FY 1998, the rate of inflation for the Medicare fee-for-service
program dropped to the lowest in the program's entire history (since 1965)
-- 1.5 percent.&nbsp; Overall, CBO calculated the average Medicare inflation
rate for FY 1997 to FY 2000 at 3.2 percent. CBO commented that: "Most of
the decline can be explained by a strong effort to ensure compliance with
payment rules." (The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011,
CBO, January 2001)
<p>As of 1996, the Trustees of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund projected
that the Trust Fund would be insolvent in 1999. However, over the past
5 years, the Trustees have extended their estimate of the financial life
of the Trust Fund by 30 years, from 1999 until 2029.&nbsp; One of the primary
contributing factors cited by the Trustees has been "the continuing efforts
to combat fraud and abuse." (Status of the Social Security and Medicare
Programs, Trustees Annual Report, March 1999).&nbsp; We believe that these
positive economic findings with respect to the financial integrity of the
Medicare program, which will positively impact on both taxpayers and beneficiaries,
are due in large part to the fact that the vast majority of health care
providers are engaged in submitting accurate claims to HCFA and providing
high quality, medically necessary services.
<p><b>INAPPROPRIATE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAYMENTS</b>
<p>Numerous OIG audits and investigations have revealed instances where
antiquated and complex computer systems have resulted in inappropriate
payments being made on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.&nbsp;
Several recent OIG audits and inspections examined whether the Medicare
or Medicaid programs were being billed for services which occurred after
the date of a beneficiary's death and whether these programs were paying
for such services. We have also recently completed work to identify inappropriate
payments made on behalf of incarcerated Medicare beneficiaries.
<p><b><i>Payments Made on Behalf of Deceased Beneficiaries</i></b>
<p><b>Medicare Services:</b> In our inspection, <i>Medicare Payments for
Services After Date of Death</i> (OEI-03-99-00200), we found that Medicare
paid an estimated $20.6 million in 1997 for services that started after
a beneficiary's date of death. These payments were made because of several
system problems. Approximately $12.6 million was paid because Medicare
had not yet received beneficiary date of death information from the Social
Security Administration (SSA) Master Beneficiary Record at the time the
claim was processed. For example, for one beneficiary who died in May 1997,
HCFA did not receive the date of death information until October 1997.
This delay allowed three months of rental payments for a nebulizer to be
paid in June, July, and August 1997.
<p>The remaining $8 million was paid for services where the beneficiary's
date of death was in its system at the time the claim was processed and
approved for payment, but HCFA's Common Working File system, the system
used by fiscal intermediaries and carriers to process fee-for-services
claims, did not prevent the claims from being paid. Over half of the $8
million was for durable medical equipment claims. For example, for one
beneficiary who died in November 1997, HCFA received the date of death
information in that same month. However, in January 1998, HCFA paid claims
on behalf of that beneficiary for durable medical equipment items with
service dates in December of 1997.
<p>We also found some payments for services where HCFA's Enrollment Database,
which contains entitlement data for Medicare beneficiaries, and the Common
Working File contained different dates of death. In one example, a beneficiary
received four services relating to ambulance transport on May 12, 1997.
Although data from the Enrollment Database indicated that the beneficiary
died on May 9, 1997, the Common Working File contained a different date
of death of May 13, 1997. In such examples, we found no indication of which
file contained the accurate date of death and therefore do not know whether
or not the claims were paid in error.
<p>As a result of our findings, we recommended that HCFA require contractors
to conduct annual post-payment reviews to identify and recover payments
made for services after death; revise their Common Working File system
edit to ensure that durable medical equipment payments are not made for
deceased beneficiaries; and periodically reconcile date of death information
between the Enrollment Database and Common Working Files. In January 2001,
HCFA implemented the system change necessary to revise the Common Working
File edits to prevent payment of durable medical equipment services billed
after the beneficiary's date of death. HCFA has also recently issued instructions
to Medicare contractors requiring them to conduct the necessary post-payment
review activities to identify payments made on behalf of deceased beneficiaries.
However, HCFA indicated that there is no way to systematically compare
the Enrollment File and Common Working File to determine which date of
death is accurate without a manual review; therefore, they will need to
take into account contractor workload while implementing this recommendation.
<p><b>Medicaid Services: </b>In 1994, the OIG began an initiative to work
more closely with State Auditors in reviewing the Medicaid program. Through
this initiative, the OIG/State Audit Partnership Plan was developed to
expand Medicaid program audits and allow State Auditors to apply methodologies
we have successfully used in our Medicare audits. As an example, the State
of Ohio's Office of the Auditor examined whether Medicaid was paying for
services on behalf of deceased recipients (<i>Payments for Medicaid Services
to Deceased Recipients</i>,<b> </b>A-05-00-00045). The audit determined
that, during a period of almost 6 years, the Ohio Department of Human Services
(ODHS) paid $82 million for services to Medicaid recipients after the recipients'
date of death. This amount consisted of 115,000 payments to over 4,000
different providers for services provided to almost 27,000 apparently deceased
recipients. The average time to discover and recover an overpayment was
just over five months after the recipient's date of death. About 93 percent
of the unrecovered payments were in four categories of service: skilled
nursing facility (75 percent of the unrecovered payments), intermediate
care facility (7 percent), pharmacy (6 percent), and durable medical equipment
(5 percent).
<p>Subsequent analysis by the Ohio Department of Human Services confirmed
that information in the Medicaid recipient master file is not always accurate.
Ohio auditors determined that almost 30 percent of 34,330 Medicaid recipients
who died during 1997, according to the Ohio Department of Health's Vital
Statistics file, did not have a date of death entered on the recipient
master file (meaning that providers could still bill and be reimbursed
for Medicaid services). Moreover, 4.6 percent of the 24,463 recipients
who had a date of death on the recipient master file had a death date that
differed from the Vital Statistics death date by more than one day.
<p>The Office of the Auditor recommended that the Ohio Department of Human
Services recover the outstanding amount when feasible and cost effective,
make corrections to prevent additional overpayments from being made for
deceased recipients, and seek legislative authority to develop and apply
sanctions against providers who do not timely report a recipient's death
or who bill for or retain unearned reimbursements. The State has now recovered
all of the overpayments identified in this audit.
<p><b><i>Payments Made on Behalf of Incarcerated Beneficiaries</i></b>
<p><b>Medicare Payments: </b>We are currently conducting a series of audits
on Medicare payments provided on behalf of beneficiaries who were in the
custody of Federal, State, or local law enforcement agencies at the time
services were provided. Under current Federal law and regulations, payments
for such services are generally unallowable. The State or other government
component operating the prison is presumed to be responsible for the medical
needs of its prisoners.
<p>The rules for determining whether Medicare will pay are complex and
administratively cumbersome. Under sections 1862(a)(2) and (3) of the Social
Security Act, the Medicare program will not pay for services if the beneficiary
has no legal obligation to pay for the services and if the services are
paid for directly or indirectly by a governmental entity. Regulations at
42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 411.4(b)(1) and (2) state the Medicare
program may not pay for services provided to beneficiaries who are in the
custody of penal authorities <i>unless</i> the authorities require that
all individuals pay for such services and enforce that requirement by pursuing
collection for repayment. The State or other Government component operating
the prison is presumed to be responsible for the medical needs of its prisoners.
According to HCFA's procedural manuals for its contractors, this is a rebuttable
presumption that may be overcome only at the initiative of the Government
entity. The entity must establish that it enforces the requirement to pay
by billing and seeking collection from all individuals in custody, whether
insured or uninsured, with the same vigor it pursues the collection of
other debts. It must pursue collection, including the filing of lawsuits
to obtain liens against an individual's assets outside the prison and income
from non-prison sources.
<p>The Social Security Administration, on the other hand, has a simple
rule regarding payments to prisoners. A person's Social Security benefits
are suspended if he/she is incarcerated for a month or more.
<p>In our report <i>Review of Medicare Payments for Services Provided to
Incarcerated Beneficiaries</i>(A-04-00-05568), we found that the Medicare
program is vulnerable to improper payments for services provided to incarcerated
beneficiaries. According to data provided to us by the SSA, there were
38,600 Social Security beneficiaries entitled to Medicare who were incarcerated
as of July 2000. We used this data to determine whether Medicare claims
have been paid on behalf of any of these beneficiaries during Calendar
Years 1997 through 1999. To date, we have identified $32 million in Medicare
fee-for-service payments on behalf of 7,438 incarcerated beneficiaries
during Calendar Years 1997 through 1999. We also found that some incarcerated
beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare managed care plans during their
incarceration.
<p>We are in the process of determining the amount of Medicare payments
made on behalf of incarcerated beneficiaries which may be improper. We
are concerned, however, because, in general, no Medicare payments should
be made for services rendered to prisoners unless certain strict conditions
are met by the government component (i.e., Federal, State, or local) which
operates the prison. We are now determining if the government components
operating prisons meet the strict conditions for Medicare payments to be
allowable. The development underway includes researching State laws to
determine if prisoners are required to repay their medical expenses. If
such a law exists, the government entity must then prove that it enforces
this requirement. Examples we are investigating include:
<ul>
<li>
Medicare paid $25,423 for services to an inmate charged with killing his
mother.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In another State, Medicare paid a facility $97,283 on behalf of nine inmates
who were incarcerated for various crimes including arson, attempted assault,
breaking and entering, and burglary.</li>
</ul>
The HCFA does not identify Medicare beneficiaries who are in prison, making
it virtually impossible for Medicare contractors to prevent improper payments.
To minimize this risk, we recommend that HCFA formalize its efforts to
obtain additional data from SSA in the daily transmission of enrollment
data, which identifies incarcerated beneficiaries, and design and implement
system controls in the Enrollment Database and Common Working File to alert
contractors when a Medicare claim is submitted for services for an incarcerated
beneficiary. We recognize that implementing the routine transfer of necessary
information from SSA and making the necessary system enhancements will
take time. In the interim, we recommend that HCFA periodically obtain a
file on incarcerated beneficiaries for post-payment reviews from SSA similar
to the file we obtained during our review.
<p><b>Medicaid Payments for Inmates of Public Institutions:</b> We are
in the process of reviewing Medicaid payments for services provided to
inmates of public institutions. Our involvement began with information
received from the Louisiana Office of Legislative Auditor. The Auditor
was concerned that the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals was
including the cost of services provided to inmates in determining its Medicaid
net uncompensated care costs for disproportionate share hospital payments
made to State operated hospitals. The Louisiana Office of Legislative Auditor
had interpreted that neither disproportionate share hospital payments nor
Federal financial participation payments are allowable for services provided
to inmates of public institutions, specifically prisoners in a penal institution.
<p>Based on audit work to date, we found that HCFA has not established
a definitive coverage policy that is consistent with the intent of the
governing statute that generally prohibits Federal financial participation
payments for inmates of public institutions. The current Medicaid coverage
policy contains a provision allowing for Federal financial participation
payments for services provided to inmates of public institutions when the
inmate is an inpatient in a medical institution. We believe this provision
is contrary to the intent of the Medicaid statute. We believe the intent
was to ensure that Medicaid funds are not used to finance care that has
traditionally been the responsibility of the State and local governments.
Also, HCFA has no specific guidance on the availability of disproportionate
share hospital payments to hospitals for uncompensated care provided to
inmates. We expect to complete our review this summer.
<p><b><i>Other OIG Work</i></b>
<p>In addition to the improper payments described above, we have also done
extensive work through audits and inspections to identify duplicate payments
made in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For example, we have examined
if Medicare fee-for-service payments were made on behalf of beneficiaries
enrolled in Medicare managed care plans. This work involves identification
of specific overpayments, as well as identification of the system vulnerabilities,
which have allowed such payments to occur. Additionally, we have work underway
to identify whether Medicare payments are being made on behalf of deported
aliens. Preliminary results indicate that such payments are being made.
<p><b>TANF BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE FUGITIVE FELONS</b>
<p>The problems of ensuring the appropriateness of payments in a complex
program environment are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid. This is illustrated
in the following account of income assistance payments which we discovered
were being made to fugitive felons.
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for
Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance, oversees the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 increased the flexibility
of the States in operating the TANF program. The Act allows States to provide
assistance so that children may be cared for in their own home; promote
job preparation, work and marriage; prevent and reduce the incidence of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encourage the formation and maintenance
of two parent families. Section 408 of the Act identifies prohibitions
and other requirements for the TANF program including a requirement that
States not use any part of the grant to provide assistance to any individual
who is fleeing to avoid prosecution, custody or confinement after conviction
for a felony, as defined under the laws of the place from which the individual
flees.
<p>Project Cornhusker is an initiative of our Office to reduce fraudulent
TANF payments in the metropolitan area of Omaha, Nebraska. This is the
first such joint project we have undertaken with local law enforcement
to identify individuals with felony fugitive warrants who are recipients
of federal assistance in violation of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. As
part of this effort, the active felony warrants for Douglas County, including
Omaha, were matched with the active TANF beneficiary files maintained by
the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. This computer match
produced 64 wanted individuals.
<p>On March 21 and 22, 2001, OIG agents assisted the Douglas County Sheriff's
Office and the Omaha Police Department in the arrest of 24 individuals
wanted for felonies committed in their jurisdiction. These arrests were
made possible because of the cooperation of the Nebraska Department of
Health and Human Services, local police and OIG. Twelve additional arrests
were made without OIG assistance.
<p>The majority of the arrested subjects were wanted for non-violent crimes,
such as felony theft, bad checks, burglary and crimes against property.
Three subjects were arrested on warrants for assault, one with a deadly
weapon. Specific information concerning some of the arrests are identified
below:
<ul>
<li>
A subject was arrested and found to have three Social Security cards in
another individual's name. He also had a birth certificate in that subject's
name with two passport photos of himself. This information was sent to
the Social Security Administration, Office of Inspector General, Office
of Investigations.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
An individual was arrested and found to be in possession of black tar heroin.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Upon request, an individual present during the arrest of a TANF recipient
produced identification. A check of law enforcement records showed that
the individual was currently wanted in Louisiana for failure to pay court
ordered child support. He was subsequently arrested on that charge.</li>
</ul>
Because of the success of this effort, we are considering replicating this
type of joint initiative in the future.<b></b>
<p><b>MODERNIZING DEPARTMENT INFRASTRUCTURE</b>
<p>The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has named
reforming the management of the Department's operations as one of his top
priorities. Specific priorities include improving the management of HCFA
and making appropriate investments in Department management and infrastructure.
<p><b><i>Improve the Management of the Health Care Financing Administration:</i></b>.
The demands on HCFA have grown dramatically in the last few years. On the
one hand, the agency needs adequate resources to successfully administer
the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs;
on the other hand, it must be recognized that patients, providers and States
have legitimate complaints about the scope and complexity of the regulations
and paperwork that govern these programs. The Department has therefore
begun a thorough examination of HCFA's missions, its competing demands,
and its resources.
<p><b><i>Invest in Department Management and Infrastructure:</i></b> The
Secretary has noted that one of the major challenges in a large, decentralized
Department such as HHS is finding ways to bring together diverse activities
and to develop coordinated systems for managing its programs.
<p>In the area of financial management, the Secretary has proposed an additional
$50 million investment in a unified financial accounting system. The OIG
has found major problems with the Department's current system structure,
which involves separate accounting systems operated by multiple agencies.
Department plans to replace these antiquated systems with one or two unified
financial management systems should help to increase standardization, reduce
security risks, and allow HHS to produce timely and reliable financial
information needed for management decision-making, and provide accountability
to the external customers.
<p>In the information technology arena, the Secretary has proposed $30
million to improve information technology systems through investments in
the Information Technology, Security and Innovation Fund. As seen in my
examples today, these systems are highly antiquated, incompatible, and
vulnerable to exploitation. The Secretary has proposed that funds would
be used to implement an Enterprise Infrastructure Management approach across
the Department that would minimize vulnerabilities while maximizing cost
savings and the ability to share information.
<p>We fully support these proposals and continue to promote adequate departmental
resources to ensure efficient and effective claims processing, policy development
and regulation, and quality assurance. We remain concerned that the currently
inadequate internal controls leave the Medicare program vulnerable to potential
loss of funds, misstated financial statements, disclosure of sensitive
information, and disruption of critical claim processing. Further, out-of-date
and overly complex computer systems are not adequately preventing inappropriate
program payments.
<p>Over the past 5 years, the Trustees have extended their estimate of
the financial life of the Trust Fund by 30 years, from 1999 until 2029.
The expanded solvency projection provides a window of opportunity to develop
a departmental technology infrastructure for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
Over time, such an investment will lead to further savings -- by reducing
payment errors of all types and by making program operations more efficient.

<p>This concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer any questions.</center>
