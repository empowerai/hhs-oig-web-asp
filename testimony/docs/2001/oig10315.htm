<p>Medicare Reform
<p>Statement of
<br><b>George F. Grob</b>
<br>Deputy Inspector General for Evaluation and Inspections
<p>March 15, 2001
<p>Office of Inspector General
<br>Department of Health and Human Services
<br>
<hr>
<p>Good morning, Madam Chairman. I want to thank you for your invitation
to address this panel on Medicare reform. You asked us to discuss how the
government can do its job better, to ensure that beneficiaries are protected
and that tax payer dollars are used wisely and responsibly without placing
undue burdens on providers.&nbsp; I am very pleased to do so.
<p>Medicare is a national treasure. But it would be even more valuable
if it were operating more efficiently and effectively. Despite herculean
efforts to modernize it and recent success in doing so, there is a sentiment,
especially among health care providers, that it is not as efficient as
it should be. In fact, discussions in policy circles and in the national
and professional media emphasize its administrative burdens, inefficiencies,
and aggravations. There is some talk of major reforms.
<p>The Medicare program has been evolving since its creation. It has been
"reformed" and modernized many times--including the gradual abandonment
of cost and charge based reimbursement in favor of prospective payment
systems and fee schedules, and the introduction of managed care. The Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, with its new payment systems for nursing homes, home
health agencies, and hospital outpatient departments and the new beneficiary
options and protections in Medicare+Choice, is the most recent and substantial
reflection of these movements. The program as it is, including the most
recent reforms, which are not yet fully implemented, is our starting point
for further reforms.
<p>It is with this history in mind, and with insights drawn from more than
twenty years of audits, program evaluations, and investigations conducted
by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) that I would like to offer our
own suggestions on where to go from here.
<p>First, I will identify facets of Medicare program administration which
require immediate and continuing attention; then I would like to address
some concerns which have been raised about recent initiatives to address
waste, fraud, and abuse.
<p><b>PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION</b>
<p>Following are the recommendations of the Office of Inspector General
(OIG) to promote the efficient and effective operations of the Medicare
program. We believe that these proposals will also reduce administrative
burdens and frustrations for providers. You asked us to be specific; I
hope this is helpful.
<p><b>Further Reduce and Control Improper Payments.</b> Continue, even
intensify, ongoing efforts to help further reduce improper Medicare fee-for-service
payments. Billions of dollars are at stake, and years of Medicare solvency
will be lost if oversight is reduced. As we announced last week in our
most recent annual report on this subject, Medicare made $11.9 billion
in improper payments in FY 2000, 6.8 percent of all Medicare fee-for-service
payments. This is down substantially from the $23.2 billion, or 14 percent,
first reported for 1996. But it is still too high. Then as now, most of
the error is due to unsupported services and lack of medical necessity
for services rendered.
<p>The reasons for these improper payments could range from inadvertent
mistakes to outright fraud and abuse. We cannot quantify what portion of
the error rate is attributable to fraud. The vast majority of health care
providers are honest, hard working professionals dedicated to the care
of their patients. I will repeat this later in my testimony, since it deserves
emphasis.
<p>Reducing errors would be one of the best ways to turn down the frustration
and sense of hassle felt by health care providers and the Medicare contractors
who administer the program. For example, our annual reports show that hospital
documentation errors have been completely eliminated for the last two years.
This not only shows that such improvements can be made, but it also illustrates
how one source of controversy and irritation can be minimized for all parties
involved. To further achieve such improvements, we recommend more training
for providers, further refinement of Medicare guidelines and regulations
where needed, concerted efforts to reduce errors with respect to specific
codes most frequently found in error, selected surveillance by peer review
organizations (PROs) of high risk areas, and adoption by health care providers
of compliance plans that promote adherence to Medicare program requirements.
<p><b>Overhaul Medicare Contractor Structures and Authorities.</b> Allow
the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) greater flexibility in
the methods it uses to select, organize, and supervise the contractors
who handle the day-to-day operations of the Medicare program. This includes
authorities to use entities other than insurance companies, select them
competitively, pay them on other than a cost basis, organize them according
to functions or benefits areas, and hold them accountable for performance.
<p>The Medicare program is administered by the Health Care Financing Administration
with the help of 50 contractors (Part A intermediaries and Part B carriers)
that handle claims processing and administration.
<p>Over the years we have detected serious problems with contractor operations,
including fundamental problems with accounting, electronic data processing,
and fraud control. We have even uncovered integrity problems with some
of the contractors themselves--altering documents and falsifying statements
that specific work was performed. In some cases, contractors prepared bogus
documents to demonstrate superior performance, which Medicare then rewarded
with bonuses and additional contracts. Our investigations have resulted
in 15 civil settlements and criminal convictions since 1993, with total
settlement amounts exceeding $350 million. Two contractors pled guilty
to obstruction of Federal audits. A number of investigations are ongoing.
HCFA has been working to correct problems with contractors. However, some
serious concerns remain.
<p>Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPPA), HCFA was granted new authority and flexibility in contracting
for program integrity functions. It may enter into contracts or work orders
for specific program safeguard functions, such as medical review, fraud
detection, cost report audits, and reviews to identify primary payers to
whom Medicare is the secondary payer. We support this authority and look
forward to the changes in Medicare contracting that are taking place under
the new Medicare Integrity Program.
<p>In contrast to these new and promising developments for integrity functions,
the Medicare statute places substantial limits on how HCFA obtains contractor
assistance to administer the Medicare program. For example, it limits HCFA
to choosing only insurance companies to process Part B claims. As for intermediaries,
most of them are selected by the National Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association
from companies nominated by providers (e.g., hospitals). All contracts
must be cost based; other reimbursement methods such as firm fixed price
cannot be used. Furthermore, beyond the program integrity functions mentioned
above, HCFA is not allowed to let contractors specialize according to function.
<p>HCFA has proposed broader, more flexible contracting authority in the
past, but these proposals were not approved. Intrinsically, more flexibility
makes sense and we support it. So does the General Accounting Office.
<p>Another promising development is the designation of specialty contractors
such as the durable medical equipment regional carriers. They review and
pay all claims for medical equipment and supplies. There are only four
of them, which appropriately concentrates their expertise in this complex
area. They are bolstered by a data analysis unit, staffed by one of these
carriers but supporting them all. This enables them to analyze payment
and usage patterns which may suggest possible improper or questionable
conduct. They are also able to effectively collaborate on the formulation
of national coverage policies and payment control systems. A recent OIG
evaluation found that these entities are effective. This approach, however,
has not been used elsewhere, except for home health and hospice care. However,
even these specialized intermediaries are not supported by the kind of
data analysis unit that the medical equipment carrier utilize. We believe
that specialty contractors, with a supporting analytic unit, would make
sense for problematic areas and recommend that they be more widely used.
<p>More flexibility and specialization will, we believe, bring greater
expertise and efficiency to contractor operations. This will, in turn,
improve their relations with providers and facilitate provider education
and understanding of Medicare rules and regulations.
<p><b>Improve Accounting Systems.</b> Speed up current efforts to establish
a modern, integrated, dual entry accounting system for accounts receivable
to accurately portray and control the billions of dollars in transactions
in this category annually.
<p>Medicare accounts receivable primarily represent overpayments owed by
health care providers to the Health Care Financing Administration and funds
due from other insurers when Medicare is the secondary payer. For FY 2000,
HCFA reported a net accounts receivable balance of $3.8 billion, comprised
of gross outstanding receivables of $8.1 billion and an aggregate allowance
for uncollectible accounts of $4.3 billion.
<p>In FY 1998, we had to qualify our audit opinion on the Department-wide
financial statements, primarily because of serious problems in Medicare
contractors' ability to report accounts receivable. For example, they could
not support beginning accounts receivable balances; they reported incorrect
activity and collections; and they could not reconcile reported ending
balances with subsidiary records. We reported Medicare accounts receivable
as a material internal control weakness because Medicare contractors used
rudimentary, single-entry accounting systems that lacked general ledger
capabilities for Medicare program activity and reported receivable activity
to HCFA based on ad hoc spreadsheets.
<p>In collaboration with the Office of Inspector General, HCFA initiated
a major effort in FY 1999 to address these deficiencies. As a result of
this effort, the receivables balance was fairly presented as of the end
of FY 1999. However, internal controls are still not adequate to ensure
that future receivables would be properly reflected in Medicare financial
reports. The contractors still use ad hoc, single-entry accounting systems,
do not accrue liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and do not use proper cutoff procedures.
<p>A project team, formed under the guidance of HCFA's Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Information Officer, expect to complete the development
and implementation of an integrated system by the year 2007. Every effort
should be made to advance this expected completion date.
<p>Improving the accounting systems will reduce financial errors, thereby
improving the soundness of the trust funds, with no additional burden on
providers.
<p><b>Adequately Support the Infrastructure.</b> Do not skimp on resources
needed to ensure efficient and effective claims processing, policy development
and regulation, and quality assurance. Make a top-to-bottom review of the
adequacy and use of currently available resources, seek realistic budgets
for the Medicare infrastructure, and maintain reliable funding in the future.
Establish reasonable time frames for implementing new reforms to balance
the need for consultation with stakeholders and timely introduction of
new systems and benefits. Some areas deserving special attention are:
<p><b><i>Policy Development and Regulation.</i></b> The Medicare program
has always been subject to considerable legislative change as it has evolved
over the years. But the legislative changes in the last several years,
particularly those in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the two subsequent
years of amendments, have been especially extensive and complex. The HCFA
staff scrambled to implement regulations timely, consulting with industry
and beneficiary representatives in the process. Their achievements in meeting
this work load is impressive. But their limited resources will always place
them in an unenviable dilemma. To issue the regulations timely they may
have to curtail consultation; to carefully consider industry and beneficiary
concerns they may have to miss deadlines. The third alternative is to fall
behind on other administrative responsibilities. No matter which path they
choose, frustrations will abound among all parties. Ironically, HCFA's
requests for staff increases are sometimes portrayed as wasteful bureaucratic
layering. Clearly, adequate resources need to be provided and effectively
utilized.
<p><b><i>Quality Assurance Reviews.</i></b> More troubling, perhaps, has
been the unreliability of resources for quality assurance. There have never
been adequate resources to meet the needs for State run but federally supplemented
survey and certification reviews of nursing homes, home health agencies,
end stage renal dialysis facilities, and the 20 percent of Medicare certified
hospitals not accredited by the Joint Commission. Only nursing homes are
generally reviewed yearly. But this has been at the expense of the other
institutions whose reviews have been curtailed in order to shift survey
and certification resources to address the severe problems that were becoming
apparent there. For example, home health agencies which were once reviewed
annually are now reviewed every three years. This change occurred at the
same time that the payment system was being reformed. We have documented
gaps in the reviews of psychiatric hospitals and dialysis facilities. Even
for nursing homes, which get the annual reviews, follow-up visits when
deficiencies are found are often delayed. And above and beyond periodic
reviews, resources to investigate complaints in all types of facilities
are inadequate.
<p><b><i>Patient Care Data Sets.</i></b> The introduction of prospective
payment as the method that Medicare will use for paying skilled nursing
homes adds incentives and complications to the medical care system. For
example, the calculation of the prospective payment is derived from a patient
assessment tool called the Minimum Data Set. This tool has been under development
for many years, primarily as a patient care planning system. Now that it
is being used to calculate Medicare payments, a financial incentive to
control data entry is now present. We recently studied this system and
found a significant number of coding problems which could adversely affect
both care planning and reimbursement. Nevertheless, nursing homes seem
to be trying to learn to use the system, which if properly implemented
will be quite useful. A commitment to the refinement and implementation
of this system and other systems like it is needed to improve patient care
and ensure accurate billing and payment.
<p><b><i>Claims Processing Systems.</i></b> Additional improvements are
needed for HCFA data systems used to process claims. For example, studies
by our office have found excessive numbers of unused but un-retired provider
identification numbers, which increase Medicare's vulnerabilities to false
claims. Routine maintenance of data systems could remove such vulnerabilities,
but such "household" chores are naturally accorded low priority and are
not tended to.
<p>Providing HCFA with the staff that is needed to operate the program
will not result in more hassle for providers. It will enable HCFA to respond
better to their needs. Improving the critical data systems will reduce
payment errors, improve patient care, and make program operations more
efficient.
<p><b>Fully Implement Recently Enacted Payment Reforms.</b> Do not let
the growing interest in new reforms distract Departmental policy makers
and program administrators from systematically completing the implementation
of Medicare+Choice and other reforms, such as those related to nursing
homes and home health care. Monitor, and take appropriate actions to correct,
any deficiencies discovered along the way regarding payment integrity and
beneficiary protections, including access to services.
<p>While providers worry about being swamped by Medicare rules, beneficiaries
and their advocates worry about barriers to service access and poor quality
care. This concern stems partially from the growth of managed care (discussed
later) and from the new prospective payment systems for nursing homes,
home health agencies, and hospital outpatient departments. They also fear
that the fixed rates discourage treatment of individuals with complex,
expensive medical problems. Structural shifts in the health care industry,
including the withdrawal of thousands of home health agencies from the
program and announcement of actual or pending bankruptcies in the nursing
home industry, have added to the concerns of all parties.
<p>It is overly simplistic to put all the blame on the Medicare program.
Prior to the reform of the home health payment system, OIG studies had
found a steep rate of improper payments (40 percent) in Medicare home health
payments, and investigations had turned up massive fraud involving millions
of dollars among some home health agencies at that time. The industry,
through its own actions, coupled with reforms of the Medicare payment method
and actions taken by HCFA, has done much to address this problem, although
the percent of services for which improper payments are made is still too
high at 19 percent.
<p>The nursing home industry's financial problems were due, in part, to
imprudent, and excessive purchases of nursing homes by private chains.
They were expecting continued high profits under predecessor Medicare payment
systems. Thus, many of the industry problems resulted from actions taken
prior to the reforms taking place. Furthermore, Medicare pays only about
10 percent of the cost of the nation's nursing home care. The remaining
90 percent is funded through Medicaid and private pay sources.
<p>In response to concerns about availability of care under these circumstances,
we undertook systematic studies in the last two years to measure access
to care. These studies found that few Medicare patients being discharged
from hospitals were unable to get home health care or nursing care when
they needed it. There was no evidence of patients backing up in hospitals
waiting for a home health or nursing home treatment slot. However, some
patients with complex and expensive medical conditions did experience some
delays. In the last two sessions of Congress, legislation was enacted to
increase payment rates for these programs.
<p>Overall, the nursing home and home health program reforms enacted by
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 seem well suited to the problems they attempted
to address. For both programs, payments for patients with expensive, complex
problems are higher than those for patients with less severe problems.
Home care is paid on a 60 day cycle, so there is no limit to the care of
individuals with longer term problems. For nursing homes, the payment is
made on a daily rate basis, again providing adaptation for patients with
longer term needs. The new payment systems reduce vulnerabilities inherent
in the previous systems, which promoted unnecessary care in some cases.
But these reforms are not yet fully implemented. The danger to avoid is
that with new policy initiatives on the front burner, policy makers and
administrators may get distracted from the management of previously legislated
reforms.
<p>HCFA needs to monitor these changes carefully, particularly to insure
that payments are made timely and correctly. We will continue and even
expand our own annual reviews, particularly those intended to ensure that
beneficiaries have access to nursing home and home health care and receive
quality services while the new payment systems take hold. We will report
what we find, one way or the other, so that the Congress, HCFA, and the
medical care industries involved can respond accordingly.
<p>The most chaotic phase of program implementation--the initial one--is
now nearly over. Methodical completion of implementation can be done smoothly
if the health care industry and Medicare program administrators monitor
developments and are open to adjustments when needed.
<p><b>Follow Through on Quality of Care Initiatives.</b> In particular,
carefully monitor nursing home reforms to insure a safe environment and
high quality of care for residents.
<p>Not all quality of care problems are related to recent changes in payment
systems. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 contained a major
section on nursing home reforms intended to address longstanding patient
care issues. Unfortunately, ten years later the Office of Inspector General
as well as the General Accounting Office continue to expose serious quality
of care problems. We found increases in the incidence of bed sores, nutrition
problems, and conditions conducive to accidents. The survey and certification
system was found to be fundamentally flawed, allowing nursing homes with
serious deficiencies to continue operations despite repeated violations.
The methods used to schedule visits eliminated the element of surprise,
making it possible for nursing homes to prevent discovery of deficiencies.
<p>Quality of care problems are not limited to nursing homes. Recent national
studies identified troubling levels of medical errors in hospitals. Our
own program evaluation studies revealed weaknesses in the review system
used by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of HealthCare Organizations
(JAHCO), which Medicare relies on for quality oversight of 80 percent of
participating hospitals. We found that their surveys are unlikely to detect
substandard patterns of care or individual practitioners with questionable
skills. There were few random, unannounced reviews and little opportunity
for surveyors on site to probe hospital conditions or practices. The whole
review process was more collegial than independent and objective. For the
20 percent of Medicare certified hospitals which are not accredited by
JAHCO, we found that half had gone without a State survey for more than
3 years (the industry standard) and some for as long as 8 years. Troubling
shortcomings have also been discovered in quality oversight systems for
psychiatric hospitals, again highlighted in OIG reports.
<p>The Department and the Joint Commission have prepared responsive initiatives
to correct the problems identified. However, the corrective actions are
complex and have not yet been fully implemented. Furthermore, these problems
are the kind that require constant vigilance.
<p>For nursing homes, this means more unannounced onsite reviews, more
frequent and intensive reviews of repeat offenders, more follow-up on serious
deficiencies, imposition of fines and penalties for serious offenders,
with fewer "second chances" to correct their problems, special initiatives
to focus on selected serious problems like bedsores, and general improvements
in training of State reviewers. For hospitals this means public accountability
for JAHCO and State agencies for their performance and determining the
minimum appropriate cycle for conducting surveys of nonaccredited hospitals
and special reviews by contracted psychiatric review teams for psychiatric
hospitals.
<p>Continuous quality oversight does not burden providers the way inconsistent,
sporadic, infrequent, and unfamiliar oversight does. Patient care is enhanced,
reducing disputes between providers, advocacy groups, and Medicare administrators
on the most fundamental aspects of the program.
<p><b>Restructure Appeals and Grievance Systems.</b> Overhaul Medicare
appeals and grievance systems by establishing a dedicated corps of Medicare
Administrative Law Judges (ALJs); providing adequate resources to handle
current and projected caseload; making guidelines more uniform; adopting
separate procedures for beneficiaries and providers; making Departmental
Appeals Boards decisions precedential; and improving timeliness of reviews.
<p>Current Medicare appeals and grievances systems are not sufficiently
responsive to the needs of beneficiaries, health care providers, or the
Medicare program itself. Originally designed with beneficiaries in mind,
most appeals are now generated by providers. The non-adversarial nature
of the procedures, which were originally intended to simplify matters for
beneficiaries, leaves the Medicare program with no representative once
the appeal process starts.
<p>The current system was started when the program first began. At that
time, Medicare was in the same Department as the Social Security Administration
(SSA) and was relatively small in comparison to the Social Security program.
It made perfect sense to use the appeals and grievance system of SSA to
handle Medicare's needs. Since then, the SSA became an independent agency,
and Medicare has grown in size and complexity. But the ALJs who handle
Medicare are still attached to SSA with only a small corps dedicated to
Medicare. Many ALJs who handle Medicare cases do so in addition to their
duties as SSA judges.
<p>These two features of the original appeals and grievance system--its
focus on beneficiary complaints, and its status as an adjunct to SSA--have
left it ill prepared to deal with the growth and complexity of Medicare
and the prominent role, needs, and expectations of providers. As a result,
providers experience delays and inconsistent rulings. Medicare has a very
limited role in representing the interests of the program.
<p>Compounding the intrinsic weakness of the system is a recent significant
growth in workload. For example, the number of ALJ hearings increased from
28,515 in 1996 to 49,253 in 1998. The Departmental Appeals Board reports
that appeals to it rose from 46 in 1994 to 670 in 200. Yet, minimal resources
have been allocated to this hearing function.
<p>Overall, the system has few champions and needs a top to bottom overhaul.
<p>The recently enacted Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 200
(BIPA) modified the appeals process by establishing time limits on earlier
stages of the appeals process which, if breached, provided for automatic
referral to the next higher level. These new provisions, which will go
into effect on October 1, 2002, could lead to inappropriate decisions due
to unrealistic time spans to address complex questions, a clogging of the
appeals channels, and an inability to prioritize decision making.
<p>The BIPA provisions were intended to address legitimate concerns of
providers to get prompt answers to their appeals and coverage questions.
However, these new procedures are likely to cause additional rather than
fewer burdens and aggravations by overwhelming the appeals and review channels.
While well intended, they do not address the weaknesses in the fundamentals
of the appeals and grievance systems--resources, guidance and standards,
organizational locus of ALJs, rules of precedence, appropriate adaptation
of procedures to beneficiaries and providers, and timeliness of reviews.
A better approach, we believe, would be to conduct a more comprehensive
study of the entire process with input from all the affected parties. New
recommendations can be considered and implement before the BIPA provisions
take effect. The latter can be modified through legislation based on the
results of the study.
<p><b>Build the Monitoring and Assessment Tools Into Future Reforms.</b>
Specify the cost and encounter data that the Department, the Congress,
and health care industry and Medicare beneficiary stakeholders will need
to annually assess the cost, effectiveness, and efficiency of any new reforms
enacted. Establish a new independent body, or use an existing one, to analyze
and periodically make public reports and recommendations regarding adjustments
needed for new programs.
<p>Managed care options have been available to Medicare beneficiaries in
some areas since 1982.
<p>The original ideas behind this concept were that a single organization
being responsible for a patient's care, with financing in the form of capitation
payments, would create incentives for preventive care, elimination of unnecessary
services, and more efficient administration. Managed care providers would
compete for Medicare business by offering Medicare beneficiaries additional
benefits beyond those available under the regular fee-for-service Medicare
program. The result would be better health care and improved health status,
at lower costs.
<p>At the end of each of the last three years, a significant number of
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have withdrawn from the program
or reduced their coverage areas. Many have also restructured their benefit
and coinsurance provisions. For example, at the end of the year 2000, 65
HMOs chose not to renew their contracts and 53 reduced service areas, affecting
more than 934,000 beneficiaries. Approximately 83 percent of affected beneficiaries
were able to enroll in another HMO; the remainder had no choice but to
return to Medicare-fee-for-service coverage.
<p>There are other issues connected with managed care options, including
shortcomings in the understandability of marketing materials and handbooks
of information provided to beneficiaries, and issues surrounding appeals
and grievance processes.
<p>The Medicare+Choice legislation improved data and information collection
aimed at assessing the costs of managed care. Managed care plans are now
reporting actual costs in a way that for the first time makes it possible
to assess the reasonableness of their cost rates and benefit packages.
<p>Some of the key lessons learned from the current Medicare managed care
program are that: market forces alone cannot be depended upon to ensure
reliable benefits at reasonable cost; accurate cost is essential for the
analysis of proposed new contracts; and reliable, easy to understand member
materials are essential to ensure intelligent choice by beneficiaries.
Any future Medicare reforms designed to offer additional flexibility to
Medicare beneficiaries will need to provide similar transparency about
costs and benefits to both beneficiaries and Medicare administrators.
<p>This will enable Medicare to avoid the kind of turmoil recently experienced
in managed care, thereby preventing administrative burdens and aggravations
for both providers and beneficiaries.
<p><b>PAYMENT CONTROLS: PROVIDERS' CONCERNS</b>
<p>As previously noted, the OIG annual Medicare payment error rate audit
does not determine whether an inappropriate provider payment request is
the result of an innocent error, a misunderstanding of Medicare coverage,
pricing, or payment rules, carelessness, mismanagement, or outright fraud.
It is not a "fraud error" rate and should not be construed as such.
<p>Despite our best and continued efforts to emphasize the nature of the
payment error rate and our respect for the integrity of health care providers,
some of them have become more vocal in their objections to what they regard
as overzealous scrutiny. Particularly in the physician community, some
providers express fear that they will be prosecuted as criminals for making
honest billing errors while trying to interpret regulations of an increasingly
complex Medicare program.
<p>Let me repeat what I said earlier. The vast majority of physicians and
other health care providers are honest, dedicated individuals who work
hard for their patients. Their concerns deserve our attention. I would
like to take advantage of this opportunity to respond to them To do so,
I must first explain the nature of the Federal fraud and abuse control
program, and I need to put it into the context of broader reforms that
have been occurring in the Medicare program.
<p><b><i>Fraud and Abuse Control Program.</i></b> To address fraud and
abuse, a Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC), jointly administered
by the Secretary of the Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Office
of Inspector General and the Justice Department, was enacted into law as
part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
That same law provided HCFA with increased funding for a Medicare Integrity
Program (MIP).
<p>The Act provided both new authorities and critical resources to enable
HHS, the Justice Department, and the many Federal, State, and local programs
and agencies engaged in health care fraud enforcement to better detect,
investigate, prosecute, and prevent fraud and abuse. In Fiscal Year 2000
alone, the Federal Government won or negotiated more than $1.2 billion
in judgements, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care
fraud cases. Actual collections for the year in health care cases exceeded
$715 million, with more than $577 million returned to the Medicare Trust
Fund. Since inception of the program in October 1997, over $2.1 billion
has been returned to the Trust Fund.
<p>The program has also enabled this Department to step up its efforts
to exclude from Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs
providers and suppliers that engage in certain prohibited conduct. During
Fiscal Year 2000, over 3,300 individuals and entities were excluded from
program participation. Exclusions were based on criminal convictions for
crimes related to Medicare or other health care programs, patient abuse
or neglect, license revocation, and other misconduct.
<p><b><i>Program Structure and Controls.</i></b> Perhaps more important
than fraudulent billings are large but unnecessary payments stemming from
perverse incentives and weak controls. For example, much of the historical
double digit growth rates of hospital payments in the late 1970's was the
product of government policy to pay on the basis of costs and charges,
not the result of provider misconduct. Those excessive growth rates were
curbed not so much by audits and payment controls but by changing to a
new reimbursement model, the prospective payment system. More recently,
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated prospective payment systems for
home health care, nursing home services, and hospital outpatient services.
These program reforms, along with tougher scrutiny of providers seeking
to enroll in the program, increased audit and medical necessity reviews,
and provider education reduced Medicare payments by tens of billions of
dollars. For example, home health expenditures dropped from $18 billion
in 1996 to $9.5 billion in FY 1999.
<p><b><i>Provider Concerns.</i></b> Continued participation of health care
providers of all kinds--physicians and other health care professionals,
hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, laboratories, equipment
manufacturers and suppliers--is crucial to the success of the Medicare
program. All of them have been profoundly affected by recent Medicare reforms.
They are also affected by current regulations and administrative procedures.
<p>However, provider concerns relating to inappropriate investigations
are unfounded and both HCFA and the Office of Inspector General are reaching
out to physician groups to reassure them. First, under the law, physicians
and other health care providers are <i>not</i> subject to civil or criminal
penalties for honest mistakes, errors, or even negligence. The government's
primary enforcement tool, the civil False Claims Act, covers only offenses
which are committed with actual knowledge, reckless disregard, or deliberate
ignorance of the falsity of the claim.
<p>The False Claims Act simply does not cover mistakes, errors, or negligence.
The other major civil remedy available to the Office of Inspector General,
the Civil Monetary Penalties law, has exactly the same standard of proof.
For a criminal case, the standard is higher. The Office of Inspector General
is very mindful of the difference between negligent errors and mistakes
on one hand, and reckless or intentional misconduct on the other. As a
result of the relatively high standards of proof needed to establish liability,
the number of civil and criminal penalty actions initiated against physicians
is fairly small, averaging less than 50 penalty actions per year. Last
year, as a result of OIG efforts, only 12 of the more than 600,000 physicians
who participate in the Medicare program were convicted of health care related
crimes.
<p>Both HCFA and the Office of Inspector General have also been engaging
health care providers to join in a national effort to eliminate fraud and
abuse and have undertaken numerous outreach efforts to help the medical
care industry avoid getting into trouble. The cornerstone of OIG efforts
has been the publication of voluntary compliance program guidances (developed
with industry input) to assist and encourage the various sectors of the
private health care industry to voluntarily fight fraud and abuse. In addition,
we issue special fraud alerts and advisory bulletins advising medical care
providers on topics that warrant their attention. All this information,
as well as the results of our audits, investigations, and evaluations,
are routinely made available through public presentations and on our web
site.
<p>HCFA too has enhanced its provider education efforts and has expedited
its process for issuing new regulations, such as those required by numerous
program changes mandated by the Balanced Budget Act and subsequent legislation.
Their web site has been upgraded to make program information more widely
and quickly available than ever before. And they use numerous technical
advisory boards made up of health care professionals to advise on policy.
In addition, HCFA has organized a "Physician Regulatory Issues Team" to
assess the weight of Medicare regulatory burden on physicians. Its goal
is to recommend changes to reduce administrative burden.
<p><b><i>Program Complexity.</i></b> Providers are concerned about the
complexity of Medicare, even without reference to their potential liability
for fraudulent or abusive behavior. Since the inception of Medicare, numerous
legislative changes have been made and amendments added to the Social Security
Act which have led to substantial changes to the Medicare program. With
each addition, HCFA is required to develop new regulations as well as update
its contractor and provider rules and guidelines. For example, the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 contained 335 provisions related to Medicare programs,
which required the development of a substantial number of new regulations.
<p>Much of the complexity in the Medicare program is not inherent in the
program itself, but rather it parallels the ever increasing complexity
of our health care system. For example, the development of various forms
of managed care and new kinds of vertical and horizontal integration have
led to the need for Medicare rules and regulations to evolve along with
them.
<p>As noted earlier, the way Medicare pays for health care has changed,
through time, from primarily cost/charge based payment systems to new fee-schedule
and prospective based arrangements. For example, hospital inpatient, physician,
then lab and durable medical equipment services were the first areas of
the program to switch to prospective payment or fee-schedule based payment
systems. More recently, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospital
outpatient services have moved or are moving to prospective payment systems
as well. This transitioning from one payment system to another inevitably
involves an intensive and somewhat uncomfortable learning period. In the
long run, it is hoped that these new payment systems will simplify and
reduce
the administrative burdens of providers.
<p>Is the Medicare payment system too difficult to understand? In some
cases, our audits and evaluations do indicate that some rules are unnecessarily
complex and burdensome. In such cases, we make recommendations for simplification.
However, our recent error rate review indicates that providers are doing
a very good job of negotiating their way through Medicare payment systems,
and we estimated 93 percent of all Medicare payments to health care providers
were free of error. In the substantial majority of cases, legitimate providers
are billing for legitimate services.
<p>Nevertheless, providers remain concerned. Their legitimate concerns
about program complexity, inconsistency, burdens, and hassles need to be
considered. Providers need high level reassurances that they will not be
assessed penalties for honest errors. At the same time, regulations to
implement new programs need to be issued in a timely manner, and program
integrity concerns need to be addressed.
<p><b>PROPOSED LEGISLATION</b>
<p>The Medicare Education and Regulatory Fairness Act of 2001 (HR 868)
has just been introduced to address some of the concerns of providers which
were discussed in the previous section. I was asked to comment on this
bill in my testimony, and appreciate the opportunity to do so.
<p>Given what I just said about our appreciation of providers' concerns,
we would support some action by HCFA and possibly the Congress to address
valid problem areas. However, the Office of Inspector General cannot support
this bill as written. While its objectives are worthy, we are concerned
that many of the provisions will subject the Medicare Trust Funds to a
high level of risk and possibly result in harm to beneficiaries. I will
provide summary comments here, but hope that our staffs can meet to discuss
these provisions in greater detail. Hopefully, we can find ways to address
the concerns that this bill was meant to address without endangering the
integrity of the Medicare program, as this bill would.
<p>First, I will identify the provisions which we believe are most problematic.
Then I will identify some provisions which appear to us to be more promising
and which merit additional consideration. Our primary concerns are related
to:
<p><b>Judicial and Regulatory Challenges</b>
<p>The bill would nullify longstanding legal doctrines requiring "exhaustion
of administrative remedies" and a "case or controversy" in order to appeal
matters to Federal court. It would eliminate these requirements for cases
challenging the constitutionality and statutory authority of HCFA regulations.
This would clutter the Federal courts with hypothetical, possibly trivial
cases and deny the courts the advice, insight, and judgement of Federal
agencies and administrative appeals bodies in making decisions.
<p>The bill would establish of unreasonable timeframes for hearings by
ALJs and the Departmental Appeals Board. While the goal of this proposal
may be to expedite the review process, it is highly unlikely that this
result will be achieved. In all likelihood, the result will be the premature
elevation of appeals to the Departmental Appeals Board and Federal courts,
which are not in a position to conduct "de novo" fact finding hearings
on an expedited basis.
<p>The bill also requires an additional layer of review or reconsideration
if a provider is dissatisfied with a finding that the provider is out of
compliance with a particular standard or condition of participation. This
would delay the imposition of sanctions and would increase the risk of
jeopardizing the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries.
<p><b>Repayment Period</b>
<p>The bill would entitle providers to a three year repayment period for
overpayments. While repayment plans make sense in some cases (and are already
allowed under current law), they could greatly reduce the ability of Medicare
to recover overpayments in others. An exception for cases where the Secretary
finds clear and convincing evidence of fraud would be difficult to administer
and could allow offenders to flee, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise place
funds out of reach until such a determination can be made.
<p><b>Repayments During Appeal</b>
<p>The bill would prohibit recovering past overpayments if appeal is pending.
This has the same risks as the previous provision.
<p><b>Document Requests</b>
<p>The bill would prohibit the carriers from requesting the production
of records or documents prior to payment absent cause. This would prevent
review of documents supporting the claim prior to payment, even in programmatic
areas where past histories of abuse are present. Without this well established
and recognized tool the integrity of the Medicare program would be seriously
jeopardized.
<p><b>Voluntary Repayment</b>
<p>The bill would establish and unprecedented new form of immunity from
investigations to a provider who voluntarily returns overpayments. The
intent of this provision is understandable. Providers who make unintentional
errors or discover overpayments which they had not sought should be encouraged,
not penalized, for voluntarily returning them without fear of penalty or
prosecution. However, there is no need for new legislation in this regard.
As I mentioned earlier, physicians and other health care providers are
not subject to civil or criminal penalties for honest mistakes, errors,
or even negligence. However, those relatively few providers who would deliberately
and fraudulently steal from the Medicare program would not hesitate to
use this provision to immunize themselves from investigation and prosecution,
and, in essence, obtain interest free loans from Medicare.
<p><b>Extrapolation</b>
<p>Extrapolation is the scientifically valid method of statistical sampling,
and has been fully accepted by the Federal courts as a method of estimating
liability for overpayments. The bill would prohibit recoupments or offset
payment amounts based on extrapolation for the first time that a provider
is alleged to have received overpayments or when a provider submits a claim
for advice of suitability (as provided for later in the bill in the section
on education components). These provisions would eliminate an important
tool in evaluating overpayments and deprive the trust fund of the full
amount owed to it. Ironically, the bill would greatly increase the burden
on providers if, instead of using scientifically drawn samples of claims
to determine the amount of overpayment, carriers and intermediaries would
be required to review the entire universe of suspect claims of a provider.
This would also increase Medicare's administrative costs. The provisions
would also increase the amount the provider would have to repay, since
when scientific samples are used instead of universe reviews, the amount
of the overpayment to be collected is often based on the lower end of the
sample's confidence level rather than the midpoint, the most likely estimate
of the overpayment amount. Most importantly, it provides an inappropriate
"safe harbor" immunizing a provider from full liability. Finally, the few
fraudulent providers that there are would not hesitate to use these provisions
to protect their ill gotten gains from recovery and themselves from surveillance
or prosecution.
<p><b>Claims Processing Screens</b>
<p>The bill would require HCFA to reveal claims processing screens to providers.
Honest providers do not need to know the screens. Explaining them to dishonest
providers is the equivalent of instructing them how to avoid detection
and successfully exploit the program. Fraud detection through prepayment
review would be nullified.
<p><b>Advisory Services</b>
<p>The bill would give providers immunization from investigation as a result
of seeking advice on billing and cost reporting provisions of the Medicare
program. It is reasonable for honest providers to be able to seek advice
about their claims without fear of investigation or prosecution. However,
this provision would provide a dishonest provider immunization from investigation,
a result which is not at all desirable.
<p><b>Long Term Care</b>
<p>The various provisions relating to appeals in connection with long term
quality improvements cause us to have many of the same kinds of concerns
raised in the sections above--unnecessary, additional levels of review,
unrealistic timeframes for moving to the next higher level of review, and
suspension of remedies. All of these could seriously jeopardize patient
safety and quality of care.
<p><b>Promising Proposals</b>
<p>It is obvious that parts of the proposed bill are intended to assure
honest providers that they will not be subject to investigation, prosecution,
or harassment as a result of good faith efforts to comply with Medicare
requirements. Unfortunately, many of these same provisions would play into
the hands of the small number of unscrupulous individuals who use sophisticated
means to exploit weaknesses in the Medicare program. Honest providers do
not need the additional protections provided here. However, they certainly
deserve practical assurances that their good efforts will not result in
their being punished.
<p>While I believe that most providers concerns can be addressed through
administrative rather than legislative means, those sections of the bill
relating to educational programs, advisory services, deferral of penalties
until exhaustion of appeals, repayment periods, and appeals and grievances
are worthy of additional review.
<p>More provider education would be especially valuable. We have already
seen the beneficial effects of HCFA educational initiatives. They have
a lot to do with the substantial drop in the payment error rate and clarification
of documentation standards. Our own efforts in working with the provider
community in developing compliance guidelines have convinced us of the
usefulness of outreach and education.
<p>Similarly, providers ought to be able to get answers when they have
questions about submitting their bills. A program through which HCFA can
provide them advisory services would be very useful. Our own experience
in administering such a program has convinced us of the benefits. We urge
that any such initiative be fully funded. As noted earlier, however, we
would not support the granting of immunity in connection with requests
for advice.
<p>Other provisions of the bill could be helpful if substantial changes
were made to them For example, extended payback periods would make sense
if they were necessary to prevent bankruptcy or severe hardship to a provider
who received overpayments innocently. However, an automatic three year
privilege would not be appropriate in all cases. Similarly, while deferral
of penalties until final determinations are made could be reasonable in
many cases, this would not be desirable if patient care were placed at
risk. For both of these provisions, consideration should be given to the
payment of interest to the Medicare Trust Funds--for example, for overpayment
amounts sustained after appeal and during a repayment period.
<p>As noted earlier, the Office of Inspector General fully understands
the need to improve the appeals and grievance system. However, we propose
a thorough overhaul of this system. Simply specifying time limits for review,
especially unrealistic ones, will not correct the underlying problems,
as described earlier.
<p>Finally, I would also point to the various recommendations which are
included in the first part of my testimony. Their implementation would
reduce frustrations and improve Medicare payment systems.
<p>I hope that we can find ways, primarily through education and communication,
to provide the honest providers with the understanding and assurance they
deserve in their medical practice. We look forward to working with the
medical care community in finding ways to do this.
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>Medicare is important to all of us. I hope that the suggestions provided
here from the Office of Inspector General will be useful in streamlining
the program, reducing frustrations of providers and administrators alike,
and making the program better for Medicare beneficiaries. We are ready
to help this committee and all parties involved to find a better way to
manage this program. Thank you for the opportunity to present these ideas
to you.
