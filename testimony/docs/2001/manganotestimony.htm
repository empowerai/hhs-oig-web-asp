<br><b>Health Care Financing Administration's Communication with Medicare
Providers and Contractors</b>
<p><b>Statement of</b>
<br><b>Michael Mangano</b>
<br><b>Acting Inspector General</b>
<p><b>April 4, 2001</b>
<p><b>Office of Inspector General</b>
<br><b>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</b>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittees. I appreciate
the invitation to testify today on the important issue of the Health Care
Financing Administration's role and activities related to educating health
care providers and physicians regarding their participation in the Medicare
program.
<p><b><u>Office of Inspector General</u></b>
<p>Let me first provide some background about the origin and purpose of
the Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS). The HHS OIG, the first statutory Inspector General
in the Federal Government, was established in 1976 because of congressional
concerns that fraud and abuse were improperly inflating the cost of HHS
health care programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid. The OIG's mandated
mission is to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and mismanagement, and to
promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in all HHS programs and
operations.
<p>The core mission of the OIG is carried out through a nationwide program
of audits, evaluations (called inspections), and investigations related
to the operations of HHS programs. The OIG is prohibited from exercising
specific "program operating" responsibilities. As part of its statutory
mandate, the OIG is obligated to keep
<blockquote>[T]he Congress fully and currently informed ... concerning
fraud and other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies relating to
the administration of programs and operations administered or financed
by [HHS], to recommend corrective action concerning such programs, abuses,
and deficiencies, and to report on the progress made in implementing such
corrective action.</blockquote>
The Inspector General Act of 1978 ("IG Act"), &sect; 4.
<p><b><u>Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)</u></b>
<p>In contrast, HCFA with its contractors is responsible for administering
the Medicare program, including the review and payment of claims submitted
by health care providers, which may involve pre and post payment audits.
Some of HCFA's payment review activities are the result of abuses identified
in OIG audit and inspection reports. These abuses threaten the financial
stability of the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. Where particular
problems are identified which may be indicative of fraud, they are referred
to the OIG for investigation. HCFA also has the primary responsibility
for educating and working with providers to inform them on its rules.
<p>HCFA is the largest single purchaser of health care in the world. With
outlays of approximately $316.2 billion in FY 2000, HCFA is also the largest
component within HHS. Medicare and Medicaid outlays represent 33 cents
of every dollar spent on health care in the United States in 1999. The
Medicare program is inherently at high risk for payment errors due to its
size and decentralized operations (39.5 million beneficiaries, 890 million
claims processed annually, 54 contractors).
<p><b><u>The Complexity of the Medicare Program and Impact on Patient Care</u></b>
<p>Since the establishment of Medicare, numerous legislative changes have
been made and amendments added to Title XVIII of the Social Security Act
(the Medicare Program), which have led to a number of substantive changes.
With each legislative enactment, HCFA is required to develop new regulations,
as well as update its contractor and provider rules and guidelines. To
illustrate, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained 335 provisions related
to the Medicare program, including mandates for new prospective payment
systems, requiring the development of a substantial number of new regulations.
<p>It must also be recognized that much of the complexity in the Medicare
program is not inherent in the program itself, nor the result of legislative
changes, but rather parallels the ever increasing complexity of the nation's
health care financing and delivery systems. For example, the development
of various forms of managed care and new models for vertical and horizontal
integration of providers have led to the need for new Medicare rules and
regulations.
<p>Additionally, the way Medicare pays for health care has changed over
time, from primarily "cost or charge based" systems to new fee schedule
and prospective payment systems. For example, hospital inpatient, physician,
laboratory, and durable medical equipment were the first Medicare coverage
areas to be switched to prospective payment or "fee schedule based" payment
systems. More recently, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospital
outpatient services have been or are being revised to become prospective
payment systems. This transitioning from one type of payment system to
another inevitably results in an intensive and difficult learning period
for HCFA, its contractors, and health care providers. In the long run,
it is hoped that these new payment systems will simplify and reduce administrative
burden for providers.
<p>While the focus of this hearing is HCFA's relationship with its contractors
and providers, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly discuss
the OIG's outreach activities.
<p><b><u>Health Care Provider Compliance Program Guidance</u></b>
<p>The enactment of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA) established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control
Program under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary
of HHS, acting through the OIG. This new program was designed to coordinate
federal, state, and local enforcement activities with respect to health
care fraud and abuse. Since HIPAA's enactment, the OIG has embarked on
a major initiative to promote voluntary adoption of compliance programs
by provider organizations. Our goal has been to help health care providers
bill the Medicare program more accurately. When they do, Medicare pays
the right amount for a covered service delivered to an eligible beneficiary.
<p>Through its audits, inspections, and investigations, the OIG has confirmed
that health care providers that have effective compliance plans including
internal audit procedures and comprehensive staff training, not only provide
quality services, but also have fewer systemic billing errors. In order
to encourage the adoption of compliance measures by health care providers,
the OIG has worked with health care industry groups to develop model, voluntary
compliance plans. They identify steps that health care providers may <b>voluntarily</b>
take to improve adherence with Medicare rules.
<p>The OIG guidances are very specific in identifying risk areas for a
particular health care industry sector. Since enactment of HIPAA, nine
health care industry sector compliance guidances have been issued, including
specific ones targeted to hospitals; home health agencies; clinical laboratories;
third-party medical billing companies; durable medical equipment, prosthetics,
and orthotics suppliers; hospices; Medicare+Choice organizations; nursing
facilities; and individual and small group physician practices.
<p>The OIG and the health care industry, through various organizations
such as the Health Care Compliance Association (HCCA) and the Council of
Ethical Organizations, have engaged in an ongoing dialogue on health care
compliance to better understand and resolve the challenges associated with
creating effective compliance programs. We were pleased to read in the
recent HCCA annual survey of health care compliance professionals, that
71% of health care organizations now have ongoing compliance programs in
place.
<p><b><u>Health Care Industry Guidance</u></b>
<p>An important core element of the new HIPAA fraud and abuse control program
is the provision of guidance to health care providers regarding potential
liability for activities which may be considered fraudulent or abusive.
Specifically, HIPAA requires that the OIG:
<ul>
<li>
Issue upon request <u>advisory opinions</u> regarding the applicability
of the criminal and administrative sanction provisions of the Social Security
Act;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Issue special <u>fraud alerts</u>, upon request or otherwise, advising
"the public of practices which the Inspector General considers to be suspect
or of particular concern under the ..." Medicare or Medicaid programs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Issue annually a public solicitation for proposals for issuance of both
new and modified existing "<u>safe harbor</u>" regulations regarding the
applicability of the Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute.</li>
</ul>
The centerpiece of the OIG's implementation of the HIPAA guidance provision
has been the advisory opinion process through which parties can obtain
<b>binding
legal advice </b>as to whether their existing or proposed health care business
transactions run afoul of the Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute,
the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the program exclusion provisions.
Congress recently extended the authority for the "advisory opinion" process
in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection
Act of 2000. Over 50 formal advisory opinions have been issued since establishment
of this function in 1997. The advisory opinion process also serves to improve
the OIG's understanding of new and emerging health care business arrangements
and guide the development of new safe harbor regulations, fraud alerts,
and special advisory bulletins.
<p>Since HIPAA's enactment, the OIG has promulgated nine new "safe harbors" under 
  the Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute, and clarified or modified seven 
  existing regulatory safe harbors. These OIG issuances have all being published 
  in the Federal Register and are also available on the OIG's web site (<a href="../../../index.html">oig.hhs.gov).</a> 
<p>In addition, all of the OIG's final audit and inspection reports, as
well as its annual workplan and other issuances are published on its web
site. Health care providers and other interested parties are regularly
advised of new OIG issuances through a free "List Server" on its web site
which currently has approximately 9,000 registered subscribers.
<p><b><u>OIG/Health Care Provider Partnership</u></b>
<p>The OIG is actively engaged in working with health care providers and
believe we are making good progress. We continue to believe that most health
care providers do their best to provide high quality care and are honest
in their dealings with Medicare. When we talk about fraud, we are not referring
to the vast majority of providers who make innocent billing errors, but
rather those unscrupulous few who intentionally set out to defraud the
Medicare program. The importance of our ongoing work is to not only protect
the integrity of the Medicare program and ensure that high quality health
care services are furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, but to also make
the Medicare a program in which honest providers can operate on a "level
playing field"- and not at a competitive disadvantage with those who choose
to defraud or abuse the program.
<p>Continued participation of all types of health care providers - hospitals,
nursing homes, home health agencies, physicians, laboratories, and suppliers
- is critical to the continued success of the Medicare program. All of
these providers have been profoundly affected by recent Medicare reforms.
Their operations are also affected by Medicare regulations and procedures.
<p>Provider concerns relating to inappropriate investigations and audits
are unfounded and both HCFA and the OIG are reaching out to provider groups
to reassure them. Under law, physicians and other health care providers
are <b>not</b> subject to criminal or civil penalties for honest mistakes,
errors, or even negligence. The Government's primary enforcement tool,
the False Claims Act, covers only conduct undertaken with actual knowledge,
reckless disregard, or deliberate ignorance of the falsity of a claim.
The False Claims Act simply does not cover mistakes, errors, or negligence.
The other major civil remedy available, an administrative remedy called
the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, has exactly the same standard of proof.
For a criminal case, the standard is even higher. As a result of the high
standards of proof needed to establish liability under current law, the
number of criminal and civil penalty actions initiated against physicians
is very small.
<p><b><u>Results</u></b>
<p><u>OIG Medicare Fee-for-Service Audits</u>
<p>Over the past five years, the OIG has undertaken audits of Medicare's
fee-for-service claims to estimate the extent of the resulting payments
that did not comply with Medicare laws and regulations. For FY 1996, we
estimated that Medicare made improper payments of approximately $23 billion,
or about 14% of Medicare program expenditures. Most of the identified improper
payments resulted from improperly documented claims, medically unnecessary
claims, or improperly coded claims. In FY 1997, after enactment of HIPAA,
the percentage of improper Medicare payments began to decrease. And most
recently, the OIG audit of FY 2000 claims (issued on February 5, 2001)
estimated that improper Medicare payments had dropped to $11.9 billion,
or about 6.8% of the $173.6 billion in Medicare payments. The improper
payment rate declined by over 50% or $11 billion in five years.
<p><u>Medicare Inflation Rate</u>
<p>The decrease in improper payments has had a positive effect on Medicare's
financial situation. From 1991 to 1996, the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) reported that Medicare's rate of inflation averaged 10.9% per year.
In FY 1998, the rate of inflation for the Medicare fee-for-service program
dropped to the lowest in the program's entire history (since 1965): 1.5%.
Overall, CBO calculated the average Medicare inflation rate for FY 1997
to FY 2000 at 3.2%. CBO commented that: "Most of the decline can be explained
by a strong effort to ensure compliance with payment rules." (The Budget
and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011, CBO, January 2001).
<p><u>Medicare Part A Trust Fund Solvency Projections</u>
<p>As of 1996, the Trustees of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund projected
that the Trust Fund would be insolvent in 1999. However, over the past
5 years, the Trustees have extended their estimate of the financial life
of the Trust Fund by thirty years, from 1999 until 2029. One of the primary
contributing factors cited by the Trustees has been "the continuing efforts
to combat fraud and abuse." (Status of the Social Security and Medicare
Programs, Trustees Annual Report, March 1999).
<p>We believe that these positive economic findings with respect to the
financial integrity of the Medicare program, which will positively impact
on both taxpayers and beneficiaries, are due in large part to the fact
that the vast majority of health care providers are engaged in submitting
accurate claims to HCFA and providing high quality, medically necessary
services.
<p><b><u>Future Education and Guidance Activities</u></b>
<p>Obviously, more can be done to provide information to health care providers
and physicians regarding compliance with the laws, rules, and policies
governing their participation in and submission of claims to the Medicare
program. At an OIG physician roundtable in July 2000, a number of concerns
were raised by physicians regarding their inability to receive comprehensive
and timely responses to questions raised to Medicare contractors. It was
the general consensus of participants that "education and training resources
would be a key factor in implementing an effective compliance program."
To accomplish this goal, further use of web-based technologies should be
explored, making them as "user friendly" as possible. This might include
quarterly updates from HCFA regarding new policies and interpretations.
Physicians also encouraged HCFA to reduce regional variations in interpretation
and enforcement as much as possible.
<p>Finally, I want to also note that in the report relating to the OIG's
recent Medicare fee-for-service improper payment audit, we made the following
recommendations.
<ul>
<li>
HCFA should continue to direct that Medicare contractors expand provider
training to further emphasize the need to maintain medical records containing
sufficient documentation, as well as to use proper procedure codes when
billing Medicare for services provided;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
HCFA should continue to highlight to Medicare providers specific procedure
codes and DRGs having the highest incidence of error in our audits, as
well as those codes and DRGs identified by Medicare contractor payment
safeguard projects; and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
HCFA should continue to refine Medicare regulations and guidelines to provide
the best possible assurance that medical procedures are correctly coded
and sufficiently documented.</li>
</ul>
We have made these same recommendations with each annual payment audit,
as well as with individual audits and inspection reports identifying specific
improper payments. We are pleased to say that HCFA has quite dramatically
increased its provider education activities over the past few years leading
to the dramatic 50% drop in improper payments described earlier. Nevertheless,
even more educational initiatives are needed and sought by health care
providers.
<p>Are Medicare program rules and requirements too difficult for providers
to understand? In some cases our audits and evaluations do indicate that
some rules are unnecessarily complex and burdensome. In such cases, we
make recommendations for simplification. However, our recent Medicare improper
payment audit indicated that providers are doing a very good job of negotiating
their way through Medicare rules and procedures, and we estimated that
93% of all Medicare payments to health care providers were free of error.
In the substantial majority of cases, legitimate providers are billing
appropriately for Medicare covered services.
<p>However, providers remain concerned. Their legitimate concerns about
program complexity, inconsistency, burdens, and hassles need to be considered.
Providers need reassurances that they will not be assessed penalties for
honest errors. I expect that ways will be found, primarily through education
and communication, to provide honest health care providers with the understanding
and assurances they deserve in furnishing health care items and services
to Medicare beneficiaries. We look forward to working with HCFA and health
care providers in finding ways to do this.
<p>At the same time, we must be vigilant in our efforts to protect the
integrity of the Medicare program. Due to the tremendous number of claims
and amount of federal dollars involved, there will always be those who
will continue to take advantage of program vulnerabilities for their own
unjust enrichment.
<p>We stand ready to help the Subcommittees and all parties involved in
identifying better ways to administer the Medicare program. Thank you for
the opportunity to present the OIG's views.
