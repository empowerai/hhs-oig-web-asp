<p>Mr. Levinson first entered Federal service in 1983 as Deputy General Counsel of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.  He thereafter served as General Counsel of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  In 1986, President Reagan appointed him to be Chairman of the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, a bipartisan, quasi-judicial agency that adjudicates Federal civilian personnel appeals.  In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Mr. Levinson to be Inspector General of the U.S. General Services Administration and in 2005 Inspector General of HHS.</p>
