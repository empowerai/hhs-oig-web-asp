<h2>Who We Are</h2>



<p>
Since its 1976 establishment, OIG has been at the forefront of the Nation's efforts to fight waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and more than 100 other HHS programs. 
</p>

<p>
HHS OIG is the largest inspector general's office in the Federal Government, with approximately 1,600 dedicated to combating fraud, waste and abuse and to improving the efficiency of HHS programs. A majority of OIG's resources goes toward the oversight of Medicare and Medicaid &mdash; programs that represent a significant part of the Federal budget and that affect this country's most vulnerable citizens.  OIG's oversight extends to programs under other HHS institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration.
</p>


<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>
We carry out our mission using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach, with each of our six components playing a vital role.
