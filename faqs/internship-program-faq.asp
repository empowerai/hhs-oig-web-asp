					<h1>Student Volunteer Service Program FAQ</h1>

<h2 class="acc_trigger"><a href="#"> What is the Student Volunteer Service Program? </a></h2>
					<div class="acc_container">
							<div class="block"><p>The Student Volunteer Service Program provides students with the opportunity to augment the workforce in the OIG&rsquo;s Office of Investigations (OI). Students gain valuable work experience, apply their educational knowledge to the real workforce, and offer fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to problems. Opportunities are available at OI Headquarters and all Regional Office and Field Office locations. With more than 70 locations to choose from, students have the opportunity to apply during the school semester (while away from home) or during the summer session (when at home).</p>
<p>This program will enable students to provide volunteer services to OI and expose them to OI career opportunities. The program will focus on providing students substantive work experience in OI functions. Ideally, students will be assigned to work in areas representative of their interests and field of study. A list of work assignments may be provided to the student upon acceptance.</p>
