<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Recharge Centers at the University 
  of Utah (University), Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of our review was to 
  determine the adequacy of University procedures and controls over the operation 
  of recharge centers. The University generally operated its recharge center in 
  a satisfactory manner. Based on the recharge centers reviewed, however, we found 
  the need for improved procedures and controls to fully comply with all the requirements 
  of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational 
  Institutions. The University did not ensure that recharge centers periodically 
  adjusted billing rates to attempt break-even over a long-term period. Also, 
  the recharge centers improperly recovered equipment costs. We are recommending 
  that the University implement certain procedures and controls over the operation 
  of recharge centers. </p>
