<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report
    provides you with the results of our review of overpayment collections made
    for the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program by
    the State of Colorado Office of Self-Sufficiency (OSS).&nbsp; The objective
    of our review was to determine whether the OSS remitted the Federal share
    of AFDC overpayment collections to the Federal government after the AFDC
    program was repealed.&nbsp; The OSS has sufficient systems in place to collect
    and remit AFDC overpayments to the Federal government.&nbsp; During the period
    October 1, 1996 through June 30, 2001, the OSS remitted the Federal share
    of AFDC overpayments totaling $6,062,672 to the U.S. Department of Health
    and Human Services - Administration for Children and Families (ACF).&nbsp; However,
    payments were not always submitted quarterly as required.&nbsp; The OSS also
    made an adjustment to correct errors made calculating the Federal share of
    the overpayment collections.&nbsp; The OSS corrected the error with an adjustment
  included in a regular quarterly payment.</p>
