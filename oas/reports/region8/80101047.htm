<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This
    final report provides you with the results of our audit entitled <i>Fund
    Balances and Collections Reported for the Title IV-A Temporary Assistance
    for Needy Families (TANF) program by the Wyoming Department of Family Services</i>;
    Cheyenne, Wyoming.&nbsp; The Department of Family Services was designated
    as the single State agency responsible for program administration (State
    agency).&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether TANF grant awards of
    $82,230,508 for the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2000, were
    expended or obligated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    found that expenditures totaling $72,130 did not meet rules applicable to
    use of reserve funds. We are recommending the State restore these funds to
their TANF account.</p>
