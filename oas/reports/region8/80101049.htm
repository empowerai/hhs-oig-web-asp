<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective 
  of our review was to determine whether Wyoming's Department of Family Services 
  (DFS) remitted the Federal share of Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
  (AFDC) overpayment collections to the Federal government after the program was 
  repealed.&nbsp;  The 
  DFS has systems in place to identify, collect, account for, and remit the Federal 
  share of AFDC overpayments.&nbsp; However, the Federal share of AFDC overpayment 
  collections was deposited into a trust account and was not remitted quarterly 
  after the program was repealed.&nbsp; Three payments totaling $125,722 were 
  made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for 
  Children and Families between October 1999 and February 2000.&nbsp; Those payments 
  represented the Federal share of AFDC overpayments collected during the period 
  January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999.&nbsp; At the time of our review, 
  the DFS had not remitted payments for the Federal share of AFDC overpayment 
  collections for the period January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001.&nbsp; Records 
  indicate that the Federal share of AFDC overpayment collections made during 
  that time period totals $50,921.</p>
