<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p> 
  The objective 
  of this review was to determine whether the Montana Department of Public Health 
  and Human Services (PHHS)&nbsp; has continued to identify, collect, and remit 
  the Federal share of Aid to Families with Dependent Children overpayments to 
  the Federal government after the program was repealed.&nbsp; During the period 
  October 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, the PHHS collected overpayments totaling 
  $430,498 (Federal share).&nbsp; The PHHS remitted $435,463 to the U.S. Department 
  of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF) 
  between October 1996 and February 2002.&nbsp; The resulting excess of $4,965 
  remitted to the ACF will be adjusted in the payment to ACF for the quarter ended 
  March 31, 2001.</p>
