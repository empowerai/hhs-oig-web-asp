<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of overpayment collections
  made for the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program
  by the North Dakota Department of Human Services (DHS).&nbsp; The objective
  of our review was to determine whether DHS remitted the Federal share of AFDC
  overpayment collections to the Federal government after the program was repealed.&nbsp; The
  DHS has systems in place to identify, collect, account for, and remit the Federal
  share of AFDC overpayments.&nbsp; However, the Federal share of overpayments
  collected was not remitted quarterly after the program was repealed.&nbsp; We
  recommended DHS resume making <i>quarterly</i> payments for the Federal share
  of AFDC overpayments as required.&nbsp; The DHS agreed with our findings and
  recommendation. </p>
