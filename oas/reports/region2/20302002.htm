<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine, for the period April 1, 2001, through March 31,
  2002, whether the Puerto Rico Health Department: (1) claimed CARE Act Title II expenditures in accordance
  with Federal requirements, and (2) purchased prescription drugs at the lowest price available.&nbsp; We
  found that the Health Department claimed $1,567,993 for costs that were not allowable.&nbsp; The Health
  Department also did not establish procedures to ensure that the CARE act Title II program was the payer
  or last resort.&nbsp; The Health Department did not always purchase drugs at the lowest price available
  or take advantage of all prompt payment discounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the Health Department:&nbsp; (1) refund to HRSA $1,567,993 for
  unallowable costs; (2) ensure that expenses claimed include only actual paid amounts; (3) ensure that
  amended Financial Status Reports are submitted when overcharges are discovered; (4) ensure that Title
  II is the payer of last resort for clients who have drug insurance coverage or are enrolled in other
  assistance programs; (5) refund to HRSA $1,117,831 for medications that were not purchased at the lowest
  price; and, (6) establish procedures to ensure that invoices are paid within the discount periods.&nbsp; In
  its reply to the draft report, the Health Department neither concurred nor nonconcurred with our recommendations,
  but did express its intention to continue working on the issues raised.</p>
