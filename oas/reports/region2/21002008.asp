<h1><a name="begin_content"></a>Audit (A-02-10-02008)</h1>

<h2>06-07-2011<br />
Results of Limited Scope Review at The Floating Hospital, a Health Resources and Services Administration Grantee</h2>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>


<p>We reviewed the financial condition of The Floating Hospital (the Hospital) as part of a nationwide series of reviews of Community Health Centers that have received funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).</p>

<p>Based on our assessment, we believe the Hospital is financially viable and is generally capable of operating a health center in accordance with Federal regulations.  However, we noted certain weaknesses in its ability to properly account for and manage Federal funds.  Specifically, the Hospital's accounting software is not currently programmed to properly segregate operating expenses between Federal and non-Federal expenditures, and internal controls over access to the accounting software are inadequate.  We also noted issues related to the Hospital's safeguarding of assets, procurement practices, and whistleblower protection.  Finally, the Hospital does not currently maintain inventory records for all equipment or perform adequate physical inventories.  The Hospital concurred with some of our findings and described its completed and ongoing actions to address the deficiencies that we identified.</p>
