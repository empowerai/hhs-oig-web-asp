<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">New Jersey claimed Medicaid reimbursement for 
health-related services through a program called the Special Education Medicaid 
Initiative (SEMI) program.&nbsp; The State also claimed Medicaid reimbursement for 
administrative costs through a program called the Medicaid Administrative 
Claiming (MAC) program.&nbsp; The rates used by the State to claim Medicaid 
reimbursement under the SEMI and MAC programs were not reasonable and did not 
comply with Federal requirements and the Medicaid State plan.&nbsp; The SEMI and MAC 
rate-setting methodologies included costs that were duplicated, unallowable, or 
improperly allocated.&nbsp; As a result, the State improperly received Federal 
Medicaid payments during the period July 1, 1998, through June 30, 2001.&nbsp; These 
improper payments were not quantified because a prior Office of Inspector 
General audit report (A-02-03-01003) questioned school-based 
claims billed by New Jersey for the same period.&nbsp; We recommended that 
the State work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to determine 
the overpayment amounts and return those overpayments to the Federal Government 
and that it properly develop and document its school-based rates.&nbsp; New Jersey 
concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
