<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and Public Law 104-193 provided federal financial participation (FFP) for
  the planning, development and installation of Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS).&nbsp; Our
  review of SACWIS equipment and related costs provided by two outside contractors, which were claimed for federal reimbursement
  by the State of New York during the period March 31, 1996 to September 30, 2000, found problems with the accuracy and reliability
  of the State’s SACWIS inventory management system.&nbsp; Moreover, we identified SACWIS costs that were ineligible for
  FFP. In addition to procedural corrections, we recommended financial adjustments totaling $4.9 million ($3.6 million federal
  share).</p>
