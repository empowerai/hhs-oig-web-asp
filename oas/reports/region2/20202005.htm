<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The report points out that New York has an opportunity to increase enrollment in the State Children&#8217;s
  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and have noncustodial parents pay a portion of the associated costs.&nbsp; Based on a
  statistically valid sample, we estimated that the noncustodial parents of 36,877 Title IV-D children eligible for SCHIP,
  but not enrolled, could have contributed about $22.3 million toward the $40.7 million in premiums that would have been
  incurred had the children been enrolled in SCHIP.&nbsp; Based on another statistical sample, we estimated that the noncustodial
  parents of 12,347 children, who received SCHIP benefits, could have contributed about $5.1 million toward the $9.3 million
  in SCHIP premiums paid on the children&#8217;s behalf.&nbsp; We recommended that the New York&nbsp; Division of Child Support
  Enforcement coordinate with the Department of Health to revise New York&#8217;s Public Health Law so that the State can realize
cost savings associated with the SCHIP program.</p>
