<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">For the period February 1, 2001, through January 31, 
2005, we estimate that New Jersey improperly received $597,000 in 
enhanced 90-percent Federal funding for clinic, laboratory, radiology, 
practitioner, or outpatient hospital services that did not qualify as family 
planning services.&nbsp; Section 1903(a)(5) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR §§ 
433.10 and 433.15 provide enhanced 90-percent Federal Medicaid funding for 
family planning services.&nbsp; According to section 4270 of the CMS “State Medicaid 
Manual,” family planning services prevent or delay pregnancy or otherwise 
control family size.&nbsp; Of the 107 family planning claims in our sample, 43 claims 
did not qualify as family planning services.&nbsp; </p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The overpayment 
occurred because the State’s electronic Medicaid claims database did not 
identify all improperly coded claims that did not meet the requirements for 
90-percent Federal funding, and some family planning clinics improperly billed 
all services as family planning eligible for 90-percent Federal funding.&nbsp; We 
recommended that the State (1) refund $597,000 to the Federal Government, (2) 
develop edits in its Medicaid claims database to identify all claims that do not 
meet 90-percent Federal funding requirements, and (3) issue guidance to family 
planning clinics that all services should not be billed as eligible for 
90-percent Federal funding.&nbsp; The State generally agreed with our findings and 
recommendations.</span>
