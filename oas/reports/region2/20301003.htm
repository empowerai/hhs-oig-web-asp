<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Federal Medicaid payments for school-based health
  services claimed by school health providers in New Jersey were in compliance with Federal
  and State requirements.&nbsp; Of the 150 school-based claims in our statistical sample, 109
  did not comply with Federal laws and regulations, State statute, or the Medicaid State plan.&nbsp; Based
  on our sample, we estimated that $51,262,909 in Federal Medicaid funding was unallowable.&nbsp; We
  also set aside certain claims containing transportation services for consideration by CMS
  and the State because Federal Medicaid law and regulations require that transportation services
  be documented but do not specify how the services should be documented.&nbsp; Based on our
  sample, set-aside claims totaled an estimated $1,046,786 in Federal Medicaid funding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the State: (1) refund $51,262,909 to the Federal Government, (2) work
  with CMS to resolve $1,046,786 in set-aside claims, (3) provide proper and timely guidance
  on Federal Medicaid criteria to its school health providers, (4) reinforce the need for school
  health providers to comply with Federal and State requirements, and (5) improve its monitoring
  of school health providers’ claims to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; In
  its written comments, the State asserted that it was currently unable to concur with our
  recommended financial adjustment of $51,262,909 but agreed to work with CMS to resolve all
  issues concerning the $1,046,786 in set-aside claims.&nbsp; The State also described procedural
  improvements addressing the three remaining recommendations.</p>
