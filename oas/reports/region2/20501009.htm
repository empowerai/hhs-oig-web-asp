<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Our objective was to 
determine whether&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">claims for 
abortion-related laboratory services for which New York State received Federal 
reimbursement at the enhanced 90-percent rate of Federal financial participation 
(FFP) qualified as family planning services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The State improperly 
received the enhanced 90-percent FFP rate for abortion-related laboratory 
services that did not qualify as family planning services.&nbsp; In our opinion, 98 
of the 100 claims in our sample did not qualify as family planning services.&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">As a result, we estimate that the State 
improperly received $3,235,640 in Federal Medicaid funds.&nbsp; However, we have set 
aside this amount for consideration by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services (CMS) and the State because no medical review was performed of the 100 
sample claims.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">We recommended that the 
State (1) work with CMS to resolve $</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">3,235,640
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">in set-aside claims</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
(2) reemphasize to all providers that abortion-related services are not 
considered family planning and the Medicaid claim form must be properly coded 
when an abortion-related service is provided, (3)
strengthen systems to make use of 
all appropriate claim information to properly identify abortion-related 
laboratory claims that are ineligible for 
Federal funding, and (4) determine the amount of Federal Medicaid funds 
improperly reimbursed at the 90-percent rate for ineligible abortion-related 
laboratory services and work with CMS to determine the amount to be refunded to 
the Federal Government.&nbsp; New York State concurred with our findings and 
recommendations.</span></p>
