<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The New&nbsp;York State Department of Health (the State agency) 
(1) made some State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) payments on 
behalf of beneficiaries who did not meet Federal and State eligibility 
requirements and (2) did not always adequately document eligibility 
determinations.&nbsp; As a result, for the 6-month audit period, we estimated that 
the State agency made SCHIP payments totaling between $17,682,343 and 
$32,892,050 (Federal share) on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries.&nbsp; In addition, 
we estimated that case file documentation did not adequately support 
eligibility determinations for SCHIP payments totaling between $9,529,453 and 
$20,176,073 (Federal share).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency use the results of 
this review to help ensure compliance with Federal and State <a name="OLE_LINK1">
SCHIP </a>eligibility requirements by (1) reemphasizing to beneficiaries the 
need to provide accurate and timely information and (2) requiring employees of 
managed care organizations to verify eligibility information and maintain 
appropriate documentation in all case files.&nbsp; We also recommended that the 
State agency work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to resolve 
the estimated improper SCHIP <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">payments of at 
least $17,682,343 identified in the review.&nbsp; The State agency’s comments did not 
directly address the recommendations.</span></p>
