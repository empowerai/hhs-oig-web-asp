<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether psychiatric 
  services rendered on an outpatient basis were billed for and reimbursed in accordance 
  with Medicaid requirements.&nbsp; Generally, we found that the Hospital received 
  reimbursement for claims that were reasonable, necessary, and adequately supported 
  by medical records.&nbsp; However, our analysis showed that $1,181 (Federal 
  share $591) of the sampled claims did not meet Medicaid criteria for reimbursement.&nbsp; 
  Claims found unallowable were for services with insufficient treatment plans 
  or not properly supported by medical record documentation.</p>
