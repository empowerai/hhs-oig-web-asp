<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">St. Peter’s University Hospital (the Hospital) did not 
fully comply with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its fiscal 
year (FY) 2005 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; Specifically, the Hospital understated its 
wage data by $572,108 and 110,107 hours.&nbsp; Our correction of the Hospital’s 
errors decreased the average hourly wage rate approximately 2 percent from $36.5<a name="tm_469764459">1</a> 
to $35.76.&nbsp; These errors occurred because the Hospital did not sufficiently 
review and reconcile its reported wage data to supporting documentation to 
ensure that the data were accurate, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare 
requirements.&nbsp; If the Hospital does not revise the wage data in its cost report, 
the FY 2009 wage index for the Hospital’s core-based statistical area will be 
overstated, which will result in overpayments to all of the hospitals that use 
this wage index.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the Hospital (1) submit a revised FY 2005 Medicare cost 
report to the fiscal intermediary to correct the wage data understatements 
totaling <a name="tm_603980004">$</a>572,108 and 110,107 hours<a name="tm_469764417">
</a>an<a name="tm_201327422">d</a> (2) implement review and reconciliation 
procedures to ensure that the wage data reported in future Medicare cost reports 
are accurate, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare requirements.<a name="tm_201327424">
</a>&nbsp;The Hospital concurred with our findings.&nbsp; </p>
