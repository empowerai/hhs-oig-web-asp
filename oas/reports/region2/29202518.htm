<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report summarizes 50 contract pre-award audit reports issued by the Office of Audit Services in Fiscal Year
  (FY) 1991. A majority of the proposals we reviewed contained overstated and unsupported projected costs of approximately
  $85 million. The Public Health Service (PHS) contains to sustain a significant amount of the findings of overstated or
  otherwise unreasonable costs. Where proposals were eventually awarded, the PHS concurred in about $4.8 million of recommended
  audit adjustments and reduced funding $4.8 million of recommended audit adjustments and reduced funding by about $12.6
  million because of costs set aside (costs which were undocumented) by our audits. Further, regarding proposals in our review
  which were not funded by PHS, there were $8 million in audit adjustments and about questionable proposed charges were justified
  by additional documentation or other evidence or allowability or reasonableness. </p>
