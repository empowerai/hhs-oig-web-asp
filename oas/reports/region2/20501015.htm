<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>:</p>
<p> The objective of our review was to determine whether Horizon Healthcare of New Jersey,
  Inc.’s (Horizon’s) use of its MMA payment increase was adequately supported and allowable
  under MMA.&nbsp; Horizon’s use of its MMA payment increase was adequately supported and allowable
  under the MMA.&nbsp; Horizon appropriately used the increased Medicare capitation payments
  to reduce beneficiary premiums, enhance benefits, and stabilize and enhance beneficiary access
  to providers.&nbsp; Specifically, Horizon eliminated beneficiary premiums, enhanced benefits
  by adding vision and prescription benefits, and increased capitation payments to primary
  care providers.&nbsp; Therefore, we did not make any recommendations.</p>
