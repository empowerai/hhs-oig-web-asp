<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>In two previous reports we had recommended that New York (1) refund approximately $3.9 million for improper alcoholism
  claims not covered under Medicaid, (2) cease claiming for such services, (3) develop edits and controls to prevent improper
  claiming, and (4) identify and return unallowable amounts claimed subsequent to the periods audited. Our follow-up audit
  showed that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) properly addressed the first three recommendations. With regard
  to the fourth recommendation, HCFA accepted a refund for $654,982 from the State without performing any validation work
  regarding the reasonable of this amount. Our validation work showed the refund amount should have been $6,347,061, a difference
  of $5,692,079. We recommended that HCFA seek recovery of this additional amount. The HCFA concurred. </p>
