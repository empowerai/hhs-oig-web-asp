<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Ninety-four of the one hundred sampled high-dollar Medicare 
Part B payments ($10,000 or more) that National Government Services made to 
providers during calendar years (CY) 2003–2005 were appropriate.&nbsp; However, 
National Government Services overpaid providers $39,196 for the remaining six 
payments.&nbsp; Providers refunded two overpayments totaling $30,075 and partially 
refunded one overpayment ($7,707 of $7,837) prior to the end of our fieldwork.&nbsp; 
Four overpayments totaling $1,414 remained outstanding.&nbsp; National Government 
Services, the Medicare Part B carrier for about 48,000 providers in 16 
southeastern New York counties, made 942 high-dollar payments in CYs 2003–2005.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that National Government Services (1) 
recover the $1,414 in overpayments, (2) review the remaining 842 high-dollar 
claims processed during CYs 2003–2005 and work with the providers that claimed 
these services to recover any overpayments, (3) consider identifying and 
recovering any additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part B claims paid 
after CY 2005, and (4) use the results of this audit in its provider education 
activities.&nbsp; National Government Services agreed with our recommendations.</p>
