<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that for the 5-year period ending December 31, 1992, hospitals and skilled nursing
  facilities (SNFs) were improperly paid an estimated $21.6 million for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries receiving
  hospice care. Once a beneficiary elects hospice care, no Medicare payments are allowed to hospitals or SNFs for services
  related to the beneficiary's terminal illness. In such situations, the hospitals or SNFs should be reimbursed by the hospice
  facility in which the beneficiary is enrolled. The claims were improperly paid because of claims processing weaknesses
  in the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) Common Working File system. We will be recommending improvements to
  this system in a separate report. In this report, we are recommending that HCFA instruct the fiscal intermediaries (FI)
  to review the related medical records of Medicare beneficiaries in hospices and, where improper payments were made, the
  FIs should seek refunds of incorrect payments and make appropriate adjustments to hospital cost reports. The HCFA concurred
  with our findings and recommendations. </p>
