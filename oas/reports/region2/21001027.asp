<h1>Audit (A-02-10-01027)</h1>

New York Claimed Some Unallowable Costs for Services by New York City Providers Under the State's Developmental Disabilities Waiver Program</h2>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>The New York State Department of Health (DOH) claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for some Office for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) waiver program services provided by New York City providers that did not comply with certain Federal and State requirements.  Based on our sample results, we estimate that DOH improperly claimed $7.8 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for OPWDD waiver program services during calendar years 2006 through 2008.  Federal law authorizes Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver programs.  A State's HCBS waiver program must be approved by CMS and allows a State to claim Federal reimbursement for services not usually covered by Medicaid. </p>
<p>Of the 100 beneficiary-months in our random sample, DOH properly claimed Medicaid reimbursement for OPWDD waiver program services during 86 beneficiary-months.  However, DOH claimed Medicaid reimbursement for services that did not comply with certain Federal and State requirements for the remaining 14 beneficiary-months.  The claims for unallowable services were made because DOH and OPWDD's policies and procedures for overseeing and administering the waiver program were not adequate to ensure that (1) providers claimed reimbursement only for services actually provided and maintained all the required documentation to support services billed and (2) OPWDD waiver program services were provided only to beneficiaries pursuant to written plans of care.  </p>
<p>We recommended that DOH (1) refund $7.8 million to the Federal Government and (2) work with OPWDD to strengthen policies and procedures to ensure that (a) providers claim reimbursement only for OPWDD waiver program services actually provided and maintain the required documentation to support services billed and (b) OPWDD waiver program services are provided pursuant to written plans of care.  DOH and OPWDD concurred with our recommendations.</p>
