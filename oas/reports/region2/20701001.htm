<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">New York State improperly received Federal reimbursement 
for claims made on behalf of beneficiaries enrolled in a State program that 
expands Medicaid eligibility to low-income individuals.&nbsp; The Family Planning 
Benefit Program (FPBP) provides only Medicaid-reimbursed family planning 
services, exclusive of abortions, for individuals with incomes at or below 200 
percent of the Federal poverty level.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of the 147 FPBP claims in our sample, 37 were not eligible 
for Federal Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; This occurred because: &nbsp;(1) prior to May 
2003, the State’s computerized Medicaid payment system did not adequately 
identify FPBP claims that were not related to family planning; (2) some 
providers incorrectly claimed services as family planning; and (3)&nbsp;some 
providers did not properly complete a sterilization consent form.&nbsp; As a result, 
the State improperly received nearly $1 million in Federal Medicaid funds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that the State refund the overpayment, reemphasize to 
providers that only family planning 
services may be billed to Medicaid for FPBP beneficiaries, and reinforce guidance 
regarding sterilization consent forms.&nbsp; The State 
generally concurred with our recommendations but indicated that it would like to 
review our working papers prior to refunding improper Federal Medicaid funds.</span></p>
