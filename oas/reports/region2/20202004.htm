<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>We statistically sampled a population of 17,701 children in New Jersey who received Title IV-D services,
  were on public assistance, and whose non-custodial parents (NCP) were making child support payments and were court ordered
  to provide medical support.&nbsp; We estimate that the NCPs of approximately 5,930 of these children did not or could not
  provide the court ordered medical support, but could have contributed toward part or all of their children’s medical costs
  paid by Medicaid from September 2001 through August&nbsp; 2002.&nbsp; We estimate these NCPs could have contributed about
  $2.5 million of the $11.8 million incurred by the State and Federal Governments to provide health care for these children.&nbsp; We
  recommended that New Jersey utilize the results of our review in determining whether existing child support guidelines
  should be modified to require NCPs to contribute towards the Medicaid costs of their dependent children. </p>
