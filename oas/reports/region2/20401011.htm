<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The initial objectives of the audit were to determine whether New Jersey had adequate controls
  to (1) prevent Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) from paying
  providers for the same service to the same beneficiary and (2) prevent individuals from enrolling
  in both Medicaid and SCHIP or in multiple SCHIP plans. After preliminary audit work, we added
  a third objective:&nbsp; to determine whether New Jersey accurately reported Title XXI payments
  to CMS.&nbsp; New Jersey's controls were adequate to prevent Medicaid and SCHIP from paying
  providers for the same service to the same beneficiary and to prevent individuals from enrolling
  in both Medicaid and SCHIP or in multiple SCHIP plans. However, New Jersey overstated SCHIP
  payments for certain services on its reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that New Jersey:&nbsp; (1) adjust SCHIP payments on the CMS reports by $9,142,057
  and refund the $5,942,337 Federal share; (2) determine reported overpayments after March
  31, 2004, and refund the Federal share; (3) correct the programming error affecting the reports
  after March 31, 2004; and (4) reconcile SCHIP expenditures on the reports to the State’s
  database of paid claims to prevent any recurrence of this error.&nbsp; State officials concurred
  with our findings and recommendations.</p>
