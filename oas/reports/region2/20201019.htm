<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether claims for care plan oversight (CPO) services rendered by physicians
  in Puerto Rico were paid in accordance with Medicare requirements. &nbsp;We found that physicians billed for CPO services
  but were not adhering to the Medicare requirements that govern such services.&nbsp; In all 30 claims tested, physicians
  did not maintain required supporting documentation in their medical records to establish that reimbursable CPO services
  had actually been provided and that their billings to Medicare were proper and justified.&nbsp; Physicians interviewed
  were not aware of the requirements to bill Medicare for CPO services, some indicated that they did not understand the concept
  of reimbursement for CPO and many believed they were entitled to bill Medicare just for signing the plan of care.&nbsp; Although
  Triple S had provided some educational outreach, it is apparent that a much greater effort is needed.&nbsp; Because we
  found all 30 claims in our random sample were in error, there is a significant risk that $2,159,018 for 37,020 claims was
  improperly reimbursed by the Medicare carrier to physicians for CPO services rendered during the period January 1, 1999
  through December 31, 2000. &nbsp;We believe the degree of noncompliance we encountered in our review and the unfamiliarity
  of physicians with Medicare billing requirements necessitates immediate action by Triple S. &nbsp;We are recommending that
  Triple S (1) develop an action plan targeted towards providing educational outreach to promote full awareness of the CPO
  billing requirements among the physician community, (2) perform periodic post payment review of CPO claims submitted by
  physicians to ascertain that physicians are adhering to Medicare billing requirements, and (3) conduct additional reviews
  of claims by physicians with significant CPO billings to recover inappropriate payments that have been made.&nbsp; Triple
  S agreed to immediately address our recommendations.</p>
