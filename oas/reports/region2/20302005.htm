<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the New York Health Department and its grant administrator ensured
  that a mental health provider provided the expected level of service to CARE Act Title I eligible clients and followed
  Federal requirements for charging costs to the CARE Act Title I program.&nbsp; The provider did not achieve the levels
  of service originally expected as part of the fiscal year 2001 contract; however, it worked with the Health Department’s
  grant administrator to tailor services to better meet the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; In addition, the
  provider generally followed Federal requirements for charging costs to the CARE Act Title I program.&nbsp; As a result
  of the low service levels, the provider’s clients may not have received all of the services they needed during fiscal year
  2001; however, by the end of the fiscal year, appropriate actions had been taken to better meet the clients’ needs.&nbsp; The
  Health Department generally concurred with the facts presented in the report.</p>
