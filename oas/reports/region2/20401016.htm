<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether HealthNow New York, Inc.’s Senior Blue Health Plan (HealthNow) complied
  with prompt payment regulations to timely pay or deny claims submitted by noncontracted providers.&nbsp; HealthNow substantially
  complied with Federal prompt payment regulations for claims submitted by noncontracted providers and paid over 95&nbsp;percent
  of clean claims within 30&nbsp;days of receipt.&nbsp; However, HealthNow did not pay or deny some claims within 60 days
  of receipt.&nbsp; We recommended that&nbsp; HealthNow ensure that all claims are paid or denied within 60 days of receipt.&nbsp; HealthNow
  concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
