<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if the New York Department of Health (health department) met key service
  delivery performance goals and complied with program requirements governing non-Federal matching funds, previous year’s
  State expenditures for HIV-related activities, caps established for administrative, planning, and evaluation activities,
  involvement of the public in the CARE Act Title II planning process, and monitoring of sub-recipients.&nbsp; We found the
  health department substantially met its service delivery performance goals in terms of the number of clients served and
  prescriptions provided; and complied with program requirements that we tested, including non-Federal matching funds, previous
  year’s expenditures, spending caps, public involvement; and the monitoring of sub-recipients.&nbsp; Accordingly, we had
  no recommendations.</p>
