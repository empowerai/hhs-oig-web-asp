<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine
    if controls were in place to preclude New Jersey from claiming Federal financial participation (FFP) under the Medicaid
    program for medical and ancillary services (except crossover claims to Medicaid for inpatient psychiatric services that
    were included in a prior report) made on behalf of 21 to 64 year-old residents of private and county-operated psychiatric
    hospitals that were institutions for mental diseases.&nbsp; Our audit period was July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2001.&nbsp; We
    found that New Jersey improperly claimed FFP for 68 of 110 claims in our statistical sample.&nbsp; The improper claiming
    occurred because New Jersey did not have controls in place to prevent FFP from being claimed for medical and ancillary
    services provided to 21 to 64 year-old residents of private and county-operated psychiatric hospitals.&nbsp; As a result,
    we estimate that New Jersey improperly claimed $170,770 of FFP.&nbsp; Our report recommended that New Jersey refund $170,770
    to the Federal Government, in addition to also had two procedural recommendations.&nbsp; New Jersey officials concurred
with our recommendations.</p>
