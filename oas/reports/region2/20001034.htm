<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to examine the administrative cost component of the ACR proposals submitted to HCFA
  by a New York Medicare+Choice organization (M+CO) and to assess whether the costs were appropriate when compared to the
  Medicare program's general reasonable cost principles.&nbsp; Unlike other entities in the Medicare program, an M+CO is
  not presently subject to statutes or regulations which would limit its administrative costs.&nbsp; The review identified
  $96,994 (Medicare share) of administrative costs that would not be appropriate if the Medicare program's general reasonable
  cost principles were applied to M+COs.&nbsp; These costs included:&nbsp; (1) entertainment, meals, and employee moral expenses;
  (2) charitable contributions and sponsorships; (3) lobbying costs; (4) unsupported costs; (5) marketing and enrollment
  expenses; and (6) other costs.</p>
