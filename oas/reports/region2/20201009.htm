<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This audit was conducted by the New York State Office of the State Comptroller (OSC) as part of our continuing partnership
  efforts with State auditors to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program.&nbsp; The objective of the review was to
  determine whether the New York State Department of Health (Health) had maximized Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (Program)
  revenues owed to Medicaid.&nbsp; The OSC found that Health had not maximized Program revenues; had not properly tracked
  or pursued rebate revenues; and had essentially relied on drug manufacturers to remit the rebates they owed.&nbsp; As a
  result, Health had not recouped between approximately $14 million to $20 million it should have collected during the OSC
  audit period.&nbsp; The OSC also concluded that, for all practical purposes, Health did not have a functioning accounting
  system for the Program.&nbsp; The OSC recommended financial adjustments and procedural corrections agreed to by Department
  of Health officials.</p>
