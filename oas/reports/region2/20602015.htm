<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">From July 1 through December 31, 2005, the State agency 
made some Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) basic assistance 
payments that did not meet Federal and State requirements and did not adequately 
document all eligibility and payment determinations.&nbsp; Based on the sample 
results, we estimated that the overall TANF improper payment rate was 28.5 
percent of the Federal dollars expended and 46 percent of the number of payments 
made for basic assistance during the 6-month audit period.&nbsp; In addition, the 
State agency inaccurately reported basic assistance expenditures to the 
Administration for Children and Families (ACF), 
primarily by reporting expenditures for items that did not meet the definition 
of basic assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) use the results 
of this review to help ensure compliance with Federal and State TANF 
requirements, (2) consider conducting quality control reviews of TANF basic 
assistance eligibility and payment processes, (3) determine the current 
eligibility of all recipients identified in this review as improperly enrolled 
in the TANF program and ensure that further assistance is denied for those who 
remain ineligible, (4) recalculate assistance budgets for all recipients 
identified in this review as having received improperly calculated payments, and 
(5) ensure that TANF basic assistance expenditures are accurately reported on 
its quarterly reports to ACF.&nbsp; In its comments on the draft report, the State 
agency did not specifically address the recommendations.</p>
