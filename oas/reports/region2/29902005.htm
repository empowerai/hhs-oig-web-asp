<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that Administracion De Familias Y Ninos' (ADFAN) practice of charging the cost of support services
  employees arbitrarily to the Head Start Program (HSP) and all other programs it administered is not appropriate.&nbsp; Federal
  regulations require that these costs be allocated to benefiting programs.&nbsp; Consequently, we came up with a reasonable
  basis for allocating the cost of all ADFAN support service employees to the HSP and all other programs.&nbsp; The majority
  of the programs affected by the reallocation were administered by the Administration for Children and Families.&nbsp; The
  reallocation resulted in a downward adjustment of $1,182,171 of compensated personnel services charged to the HSP program.&nbsp; We
  also found that ADFAN improperly claimed $39,409 for health insurance and $75,694 for the cost of living adjustments for
  support service employees to the HSP.&nbsp; Lastly, we found that the remaining balance of compensated personnel services
  costs claimed for the ADFAN administrative component was allowable, allocable and reasonable.</p>
