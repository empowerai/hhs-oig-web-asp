<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether Health Research, Incorporated (HRI) properly
  recorded, summarized and reported bio-terrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus areas designated in the cooperative
  agreements.&nbsp; We found that HRI accounted for bio-terrorism program funds
  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC).&nbsp; HRI officials stated that CDC funding had not been used to supplant existing State and local programs.&nbsp; We
  also found that, while HRI implemented procedures to monitor sub-recipient’s expenditures of CDC funds, they are not currently
  performing on-site audits of sub-recipients.&nbsp; However, HRI officials indicated that they plan to implement an on-site
  audit component to their monitoring procedures in the future.&nbsp; We recommended that HRI continue to implement plans
  to add an on-site audit component for monitoring sub-recipients and address problem areas, as they are identified.&nbsp; State
officials concurred with our recommendation.</p>
