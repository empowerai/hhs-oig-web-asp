<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed the Robert Wood Johnson University
  Hospital Hamilton (Hospital) for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Medical record documentation we examined
  showed no evidence that a physician personally sees a patient periodically throughout the program.&nbsp; In addition, we
  reviewed a sample of 10 Medicare beneficiaries who received outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services during calendar
  year 2001.&nbsp; We found that medical and billing records provided by the Hospital in support of eight beneficiaries receiving
  cardiac rehabilitation services totaling $4,575 did not always support services performed, as well as the diagnoses used
  to establish the patients' eligibility for cardiac rehabilitation.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital work with the
  fiscal intermediary to ensure that the Hospital's outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance
  with Medicare coverage and billing requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital agreed with our recommendation.</p>
