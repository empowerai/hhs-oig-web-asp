<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether HealthNow New York, 
Inc.’s (HealthNow) high-dollar Medicare payments to Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp; 
During calendar years 2003–2005, HealthNow processed 268 Part B payments of 
$10,000 or more.&nbsp; Of the 268 high-dollar payments that HealthNow made to 
providers, 249 were appropriate.&nbsp; However, HealthNow overpaid providers $236,977 
for the remaining 19 payments.&nbsp; Providers refunded eight of the overpayments, 
totaling $111,575, prior to our fieldwork.&nbsp; Eleven overpayments, totaling 
$125,402, remained outstanding.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">We recommended that HealthNow 
(1) recover the $125,402 overpayment, (2) consider identifying and recovering 
any additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part B claims paid after 
calendar year 2005, and (3) use the results of this audit in its provider 
education activities.&nbsp; HealthNow agreed with our recommendations.</p>
