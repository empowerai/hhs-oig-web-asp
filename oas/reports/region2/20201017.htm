<strong>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if controls were in place to effectively 
  preclude New Jersey from claiming federal financial participation (FFP) under 
  the Medicaid program for crossover claims (Medicare to Medicaid) for inpatient 
  psychiatric services provided to 21 to 64 year old residents of private and 
  county operated psychiatric hospitals that were institutions for mental diseases.&nbsp; 
  We determined that improvements were needed in controls established by the state 
  to preclude claiming FFP for such claims.&nbsp; Although it was state policy 
  not to claim FFP for these services, we determined that for the period December 
  1, 1991 through May 20, 2002, the state improperly claimed $896,072 of FFP.&nbsp; 
  We discussed this issue with state officials who agreed with our findings and 
  instituted corrective actions.&nbsp; One of the corrective actions consisted 
  of amending an edit within their Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) 
  to prevent FFP from being claimed.&nbsp; Our report recommended that New Jersey 
  refund $896,072 to the Federal Government, identify and return any improper 
  FFP claimed subsequent to May 20, 2002, and that they periodically review the 
  edit in their MMIS to ensure that it is functioning as intended.&nbsp; New Jersey 
  officials generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
