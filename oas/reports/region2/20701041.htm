<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether Triple-S, Inc.’s 
high-dollar (Triple-S) Medicare payments to Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp;
During calendar years 2003–2005, Triple-S processed 13 Part B payments of 
$10,000 or more.&nbsp; Of the 13 high-dollar payments that Triple-S made to 
providers, 3 were appropriate.<a name="tm_469764889"> </a>&nbsp;However, for the 10 
remaining payments, Triple-S overpaid providers $45,426 for 4 payments and 
CMS’s Program Safeguard Contractor was reviewing 6 payments. <b><span style="color:blue">&nbsp;</span></b>Providers refunded two of the four 
overpayments, totaling $32,445, prior to our fieldwork. &nbsp;Two overpayments, 
totaling $12,981, remained outstanding. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that Triple-S (1) recover the $12,981 overpayment and (2) consider identifying 
and recovering any additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part B claims 
paid after calendar year 2005.
<span style="color:blue">&nbsp;</span>Triple-S agreed with our first recommendation.&nbsp;
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Regarding our second recommendation, 
Triple-S stated that it implemented a computer edit on May 16, 2007, to identify 
and help recover potential high-dollar overpayments.&nbsp; However, Triple-S’s action 
did not address any potential high-dollar overpayments made between January 1, 
2006, and May 15, 2007.</span></span></p>
