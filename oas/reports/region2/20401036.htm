<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Medicare payments made to a urologist in New Jersey complied with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp;The urologist was paid for services that did not comply with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp;Of the 100 claims in our statistical sample, 90 claims for 185 services were unallowable for one or more reasons.&nbsp;As a result, for calendar year 2003, we estimate that the urologist improperly claimed $230,258 in Medicare reimbursement.</p>
<p>We recommended that the urologist (1) work with the New Jersey carrier to reimburse the Medicare program for the estimated overpayment of $230,258, and (2) establish effective controls to ensure that only services rendered sufficiently documented, and correctly coded are billed to Medicare.&nbsp;The urologist disputed the medical review results for 84 of the 90 claims identified as overpayments in our audit.&nbsp;He agreed with the results for the remaining 6 claims.</p>
