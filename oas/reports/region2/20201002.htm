<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service claims paid in New York for beneficiaries
  identified as incarcerated during the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with Federal
  regulations and Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines.&nbsp; New York was one of 10 states selected for
  review.  We found 74 percent of our sample of 100 claims in New York were appropriate.  However, 16 claims totaling $597
  were unallowable according to Medicare reimbursement requirements.  The claims were submitted on behalf of beneficiaries
  who were either undergoing a court ordered competency assessment (13 claims totaling $476) or were in correctional facilities
  (3 claims totaling $122).  In accordance with New York State law, medical care in these cases was the financial responsibility
  of the state.&nbsp; We could not determine the allowability of 10 claims totaling $1,066.</p>
