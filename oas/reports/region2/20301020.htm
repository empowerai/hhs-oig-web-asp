<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether (1) Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield (Empire)
  and its Medicare Division had effective internal controls, accounting systems, and reporting
  procedures for the administrative costs included in the cost proposals and (2) these costs
  were allocable, reasonable, and allowable in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition
  Regulations and Appendix B of the Medicare contract.&nbsp; Empire’s internal controls were
  largely effective in identifying costs that should be excluded from the cost proposals.&nbsp; However,
  weaknesses in certain controls—primarily those for screening indirect costs—resulted in claims
  for $4,686,611 (1.32 percent of the total costs) that should not have been charged to Medicare.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that Empire:&nbsp; (1) reduce its cost proposals by $4,686,611; (2) work
  with CMS to determine the extent to which $2,090,653 in reported forward-funding costs are
  allocable, reasonable, and allowable; (3) properly allocate bonuses in future cost proposals;
  (4) develop equitable indirect cost rates for use in future cost proposals; and (5) properly
  consider, in future cost proposals, all elements of executive compensation when calculating
  compensation in excess of Federal limits and exclude unallowable expenses from costs transferred
  to Medicare.&nbsp; Empire did not concur with our recommendations concerning unallocable
  bonus payments, but concurred with the remaining recommendations.</p>
