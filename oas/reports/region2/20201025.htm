<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to identify inappropriate Medicaid payments to ancillary service and durable medical equipment
  (DME) providers for beneficiaries residing in nursing homes whose all-inclusive rate incorporated the costs of such services.&nbsp; In
  general, the New York State Department of Health (Health) had sufficient controls in place to ensure that duplicate payments
  were not made for physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language pathology, as well as dental services provided
  to Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing homes.&nbsp; However, Health did not have sufficient controls to ensure that
  DME providers did not separately bill Medicaid for DME it provided to nursing home residents.&nbsp; We estimate that Health
  made improper payments to DME providers totaling at least $1,212,805 ($606,403 Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that
  Health (1) refund $606,403 to the Federal Government for its share of the identified overpayments; (2) ensure that DME
  providers bill the nursing home rather than Medicaid for services included in the nursing home rate by requiring the Medicaid
  reviewer, during their prior approval process, to determine whether Medicaid or the nursing home is responsible for payment;
  (3) issue guidance to DME providers specifying that augmentative communication devices are not custom-made and therefore,
  not separately billable to Medicaid for nursing home residents; (4)&nbsp; instruct DME providers not to refill any prescriptions
  without the beneficiary’s or their representative’s authorization, and; (5)&nbsp; prospectively, calculate Medicaid per
  diem rates to more closely reflect the changes in medical technology and nursing home operating costs.</p>
