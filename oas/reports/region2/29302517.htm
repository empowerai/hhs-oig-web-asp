<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report provides you with a summary of the results of 89 contract pre-award audit reports completed for the Public
  Health Service (PHS) operating divisions (OPDIV) by the Office of Audit Services (OAS) in Fiscal Year (FY) 1992. The purpose
  of this report is to provide the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) with an overview of the pre-award
  audit reports issued by OAS during FY 1992, and actions taken by the responsible PHS agencies in awarding funds to contractors.
  In FY 1992, there were over 12,000 PHS contract actions for contracts totaling over $2.1 billion. Based on requests made
  by PHS agencies, OAS issued 89 preaward audit reports in FY 1992, covering proposed costs for awards that totaled approximately
  $238 million. Our examination of the 89 reports indicated that a majority of the proposals we reviewed contained overstated
  projected costs. Specifically, we recommended adjustments totaling about $7.9 million and set asides (costs on which we
  were unable to render an opinion) totaling another $25.1 million. </p>
