<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This review, made by the New York State Office of the State Comptroller (OSC), was part of our partnership efforts with
  State auditors to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program.&nbsp; The objective of the review was to determine whether
  Medicaid payments to school districts, counties, and Article 28 facilities for the 4-year period ended December 31, 2000
  were appropriate.&nbsp; The OSC identified over 7,800 School and Preschool claims totaling $3.4 million in which school
  districts and counties billed for services that might have duplicated Article 28 services billed during the same period.&nbsp; School
  district officials confirmed that approximately $1.2 million in claims duplicated Article 28 billings for the same services
  and informed the OSC that the duplicated billings occurred because of school district billing errors.&nbsp; Moreover, the
  Medicaid Management Information System did not prevent payment of these bills because the system lacked the computer controls
  that might have alerted management to the errors.&nbsp; The OSC recommended financial adjustments and procedural corrections. </p>
