<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>New York retroactively claimed $13.2 million ($6.6 million Federal share) in Federal nonparticipating foster care costs
  for reimbursement under the Title IV-A Emergency Assistance (EA) program. Our statistical sample of 100 such claims disclosed
  that 74 were not allowable for EA reimbursement. Specifically, 72 claims were unallowable because they included services
  provided outside the 12-month statutory limit for reimbursement, one claim was missing authorization, and one claim was
  for services which were provided after the emergency had ended. Based on our sample, we estimate that at least $7.3 million
  ($3.6 million Federal share) of New York's retroactive claim is unallowable. We are recommending a financial adjustment
  for the $3.6 million. </p>
