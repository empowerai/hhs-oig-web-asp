<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Federal regulations require states to pursue Aid to Families with Dependent Children overpayments made prior to October
  1, 1996, and make appropriate refunds to the Federal Government.&nbsp; This final report points out that for certain counties
  in New York the state had not made such refunds for overpayments collected (approximately $1.8 million federal share) during
  the period December 1, 1996 through April 30, 2002.&nbsp; State officials concurred with our recommendation that the state
  refund the $1.8 million the Federal Government.</p>
