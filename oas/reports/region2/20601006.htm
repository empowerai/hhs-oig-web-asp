<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">New Jersey </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">awarded contingency fee contracts to Deloitte 
Consulting LLP (Deloitte) and Health Care Resources, Inc. (HCR), to generate 
increased Federal reimbursement by identifying and submitting to the Federal 
Government unclaimed State expenses.&nbsp; According to the terms of the contracts, 
Deloitte and HCR were paid fees contingent on additional Federal funds 
recovered.&nbsp; As a result of work performed, the State paid $21,017,894 of 
contingency fees to Deloitte ($19,681,538) and HCR ($1,336,356).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The State improperly claimed $15,956,556 ($7,978,278 Federal share) in 
contingency fees.&nbsp; Pursuant to Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, 
States may charge contingency fees when reasonable in relation to the services 
provided and when not contingent on recovery of the costs from the Federal 
Government.&nbsp; We recommended that the State refund $7,978,278 to the Federal 
Government.&nbsp; The State disagreed.</span></p>
