<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of the cash management procedures used by the University of Puerto Rico
  - Medical Sciences Campus (University) to control the funds advanced to federally funded projects.&nbsp; The overall objective
  of our review as to determine whether the University's cash management policies and procedures were in accordance with
  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with
  Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations.&nbsp; This required the University to:
  (i) minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement; (ii) maintain advances of federal
  funds in interest-bearing accounts, (iii) remit any interest earned on the advances, and (iv) meet certain other financial
  management standards.</p>
<p>Our review included approximately $43 million in federal funds received by the University during the period July 1, 1997
  through June 30, 2000.&nbsp; Of this amount, our review determined that approximately $40.1 million has been drawn down
  using the reimbursement methodology, and only $3.2 million had been drawn down under the advance payments methodology.&nbsp; The
  reimbursement methodology is designed to draw federal funds only after the disbursements have been made.&nbsp; In effect,
  the University incurs the expense and then seeks reimbursement from the Federal Government.&nbsp; The advance payments
  method permits the University to have federal funds wired to the University as close as administratively feasible to meet
  actual disbursement of funds for sponsored program purposes.</p>
