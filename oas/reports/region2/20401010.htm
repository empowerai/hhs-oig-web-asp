<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of Medicare Part B overpayments made to physicians by Empire Medicare
  Services (Empire) for billings with an incorrect place of service code.&nbsp; Eighty-eight of 100 sampled physician services
  were performed in a facility, but were incorrectly billed by the physicians to Medicare Part B using the “office” place
  of service code.&nbsp; To account for the increased practice expense incurred by physicians in their offices, Medicare
  reimburses a higher amount for services performed in this setting.&nbsp; We recommended that Empire:&nbsp; (1) recover
  $3,641 of identified overpayments; (2) work with the physicians represented in the population of potential errors to reassess
  their billings and to refund any overpayments estimated at $1,467,318; (3) strengthen its education process and re-emphasize
  to physicians, the importance of correctly reporting the place of service, and the need for internal control systems to
  prevent Medicare billings with incorrect place of service codes; (4) instruct physicians to notify their billing agents
  of the importance of using correct place of service codes; and (5) work with the Program Safeguard Contractor or the Fiscal
  Intermediary to perform a data match on an ongoing basis, to identify physician services having a high potential for error
  due to place of service miscoding, and to recover program overpayments that result from these errors.&nbsp; Empire generally
  concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
