<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>In 1994 New Jersey, based on changes to its State law, withdrew $180.2 million from State employees&#146; pension programs
  and deposited the funds into the State&#146;s General Fund.&nbsp; This final report points out that the State did not credit
  the Federal Government with its share of the pension expenses originally funded by Federal programs, grants, and contracts.
  The amount owed the Federal Government, including interest, totaled about $9.7 million. We recommended the State return
  this amount to the Federal Government. The State concurred, and issued a check to the Department of Health and Human Services
  for the $9.7 million in July 2001.</p>
