<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether organ acquisition costs claimed on the calendar
  year (CY) 1998 Medicare cost report by the University Hospital of Brooklyn for its kidney transplant program were allowable.&nbsp; The
  University Hospital of Brooklyn did not comply with certain Medicare laws, regulations, and guidelines for claiming organ
  acquisition costs in the preparation of its Medicare Part A cost report, and received excess Medicare reimbursement for
  organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; The University Hospital of Brooklyn claimed $343,272 in unsupported costs.&nbsp; The
  estimated Medicare overpayment was $263,888.&nbsp; The unsupported costs did not comply with Medicare’s documentation requirements
  for reimbursement.&nbsp; We recognize that some portion of the unsupported costs may have related to organ acquisition
  activities and would have been allowable if documented properly.&nbsp; We recommended that the Medicare intermediary recover
  that portion of the estimated Medicare overpayment that the University Hospital of Brooklyn is unable to support; review
  organ acquisition costs claimed in subsequent years for unsupported costs similar to those identified for CY 1998, and
  recover any Medicare overpayments; monitor future claims to ensure compliance with Medicare requirements; and instruct
  the University Hospital of Brooklyn to develop and maintain adequate time-and-effort reporting and accounting controls,
  and to provide clear direction to personnel as to Medicare requirements for claiming and documenting organ acquisition
  costs.</p>
