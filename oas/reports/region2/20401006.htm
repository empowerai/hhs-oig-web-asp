<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">New York State did not claim Medicaid ancillary services in 
accordance with Federal and State requirements from October 1, 2000, through 
September 30, 2002.&nbsp; Medicaid 
claims for inpatient hospital care are paid at an all-inclusive rate that covers 
costs of services, including ancillary services (e.g., laboratory, radiology, 
surgical services), furnished to beneficiaries during hospital stays.&nbsp; However, 
of the 196 ancillary services in our sample, the State separately reimbursed 
Medicaid providers for 138 services provided during a beneficiary’s inpatient 
hospital stay or on the day the beneficiary was admitted to an inpatient 
hospital.&nbsp; For 61 of the 138 services, the State did not recoup payment through 
its postpayment review process.&nbsp; As a result, we estimated that the State 
improperly claimed $293,000 ($147,000 Federal share) 
for ancillary services.&nbsp; This overpayment occurred because the State’s 
computerized payment system and postpayment review process did not identify 
ancillary services separately billed during a beneficiary’s hospital stay.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
<br>
We 
recommended that the State (1) refund $147,000 to the Federal Government and 
(2) improve its internal controls to preclude Medicaid payments for ancillary 
services during a hospital stay or on the day of admission.&nbsp; The State agency disagreed with our first recommendation and 
generally agreed with our second recommendation.&nbsp; Nothing in the State’s 
response caused us to alter our recommendations.</span></p>
