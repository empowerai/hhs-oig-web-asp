<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the New York State Department of
  Health’s method of computing inpatient hospital cost outlier payments resulted in reasonable
  payments.&nbsp; With one exception, New York’s method of computing inpatient hospital cost
  outlier payments generally resulted in reasonable payments.&nbsp; New York did not use the
  most accurate cost-to-charge ratios to convert billed charges to costs.&nbsp; Had it done
  so, New York could have saved approximately $21.5 million ($10.75 million Federal share)
  in cost outlier payments between State fiscal years 1998 and 2002 at the three hospitals
  that we reviewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that New York amend its State plan to require retroactive
  adjustments of interim cost outlier payments based on cost report data for the year in which
  the inpatient discharge occurred.&nbsp; New York concurred with our recommendation, but stated
  that implementation would require changes in State regulations and the applicable State plan.</p>
