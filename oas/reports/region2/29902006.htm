<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that New Jersey retroactively claimed $5.2 million (Federal share $2.6 million) under the
  Emergency Assistance (EA) program for the costs of certain juvenile justice and youth incentive programs. The retroactive
  claims did not meet EA eligibility criteria related to the application for benefits and authorization of services. Subsequent
  to our fieldwork New Jersey withdrew their claim based on concerns raised by our review regarding the validity of these
  claims. New Jersey returned $2 million to the Federal Government on April 26, 2000, which had previously been paid to the
  State by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). New Jersey also agreed not to seek reimbursement for the remaining
  $0.6 million which the ACF had deferred pending the results of our review. </p>
