<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) contacts employers for group health plan information on employees covered
  by Medicare. The HCFA has obtained group health plan information from approximately 1.7 million employers, which represent
  about 87 percent of the employers contacted from 1991 through 1997. The use of this employer provided group health plan
  information has resulted in approximately $2.5 billion in Medicare secondary payer (MSP) savings. However, the HCFA has
  not used all available remedies to obtain this information from the remaining 13 percent of employers who have chosen not
  to respond to the legislatively mandated request for information. As a result of not having this data, we estimate that
  HCFA has paid out as much as $282 million in Medicare funds for which group health insurance plans were liable. In this
  final report to HCFA we recommended, among other things, that HCFA assess civil monetary penalties against employers who
  refuse to respond to the requests for group health plan information on Medicare beneficiaries. The HCFA concurred with
  our recommendations and has agreed to take corrective action. </p>
