<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of the Administration for Children and Families Discretionary Grant
  Number 90CT0010 awarded to Fordham University for the period September 30, 1997 through September 29, 2000.&nbsp; The objective
  was to evaluate the grantee's performance in achieving project objectives and complying with terms and conditions of the
  grant project.&nbsp; In general, Fordham met the project goals of improving child welfare services through interdisciplinary
  training to public agency workers and supervisors and performing other project tasks.&nbsp; However, we found several exceptions
  with respect to compliance, with the terms and conditions of the grant.&nbsp; Specifically, Fordham awarded a scholarship
  to a recipient who did not meet the project qualifications; Fordham did not publish articles pertaining to the project
  lessons learned and conference proceedings in keeping with the approved project goals, and course evaluations and attendance
  forms were not always retained by Fordham.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment, compliance with all conditions
  and terms of future grants and establishment of record retention policies.</p>
