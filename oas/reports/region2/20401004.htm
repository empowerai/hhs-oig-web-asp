<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This is the fifth in a series of reports on Medicaid DSH claims that a consultant prepared under a contingency fee contract with New Jersey.&nbsp; The objective of this review was to determine whether disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to University Hospital for State fiscal years 1996 through 2001 complied with the hospital-specific limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and the approved State plan.&nbsp; We found that DSH payments to University Hospital exceeded the hospital-specific limits imposed by section 1923 (g) of the Act and the approved State plan by $171.4 million ($85.7 million Federal share). New Jersey relied solely on a contractor to prepare and document the additional acute care DSH claims and failed to ensure the accuracy of the claims before submitting them for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result of the consultant&#8217;s work, University Hospital received an additional $560 million ($280 million Federal share) for State fiscal years 1996 through 2001. </p>
<p>We recommended that New Jersey (1) refund $85,697,689 to the Federal Government, (2) adhere to Federal law and State plan requirements when submitting future DSH claims for Federal reimbursement; and (3) review all work performed by consultants to ensure the veracity of future Medicaid claims to the Federal Government.&nbsp; New Jersey disagreed with $89,500,544 of the $90,582,877 refund recommended in our draft report. New Jersey agreed with the remaining recommendations.&nbsp; After reviewing applicable Federal requirements, the State plan, and New Jersey's comments on our draft report, we revised our findings and recommendations where appropriate.</p>
