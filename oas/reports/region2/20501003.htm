<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Assisted Living Programs (ALPs) within New York State
  were improperly claiming Medicaid reimbursement when their residents were in hospitals or
  nursing homes.&nbsp; State regulations prohibit Medicaid claims for ALP residents who are
  hospitalized or in nursing homes.&nbsp; Assisted Living Programs improperly claimed Medicaid
  reimbursement for their residents who were in hospitals, but not in nursing homes.&nbsp; Our
  report recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) institute eMedNY edits and ensure that they
  are effective to prevent ALPs from claiming and receiving Medicaid reimbursement when their
  residents are hospitalized, (2) utilize our database of 2,615 potentially improper claims
  to determine the amount of improper Medicaid reimbursement claimed by the ALPs for their
  residents who were in hospitals and return the Federal share of these overpayments to the
  Federal Government, and (3) reinforce its guidance to ALP providers that State regulations
  prohibit claims for their residents who are hospitalized.&nbsp; The State disagreed with
  our findings and two of our three recommendations.&nbsp; We believe that our findings and
  recommendations are valid.</p>
