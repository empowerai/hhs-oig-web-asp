<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Federal Medicaid payments for speech services claimed by New
  York City Department of Education were in compliance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; Eighty-six
  of 100 speech claims in our sample did not comply with requirements and 68 of the sampled claims contained
  more than 1 deficiency.&nbsp; Specifically: (1) For 42 claims, we were unable to verify that the services
  billed were rendered.&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; For 47 claims, we were unable to verify that a minimum of 2 speech
  services were rendered during the month billed.&nbsp; (3) Two claims lacked any documentation at all.&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Forty-three
  claims lacked a referral by an appropriate medical professional.&nbsp; (5) For 24 claims, no child’s
  plan/family plan was provided or the plan was untimely.&nbsp; (6) One claim did not include a recommendation
  for speech services in the child’s plan/family plan.&nbsp; (7) For 76 claims, the services were not
  provided by or under the direction of an individual certified by the American Speech-Language-Hearing
  Association or a similarly qualified person.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that the State improperly
  claimed $435,903,456 in Federal Medicaid funding during our audit period.</p>
<p>We recommend that the State (1) refund $435,903,456 to the Federal Government, (2) provide proper
  and timely guidance on Federal Medicaid criteria to New York City Department of Education, (3) reinforce
  the need for New York City Department of Education to comply with Federal and State requirements, (4)&nbsp;improve
  its monitoring of New York City Department of Education’s speech claims to ensure compliance with Federal
  and State requirements, and (5) instruct New York City Department of Education to maintain appropriate
  documentation to support its speech claims.&nbsp; In written comments on our draft report, State officials
  disagreed with most aspects of the report, including the audit period, approach, criteria, and conclusions,
  and stated that the draft report should be withdrawn.&nbsp; The State also expressed concern that we
  had applied Federal regulations designed for a medical office setting to an educational setting and
  that we had not conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.</p>
