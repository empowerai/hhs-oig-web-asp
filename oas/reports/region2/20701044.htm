<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="CM2">National Government Services overpaid Medicare providers $109,000 
for 7 of the 100 high-dollar payments ($10,000 or more) in our statistical 
sample for calendar years (CY) 2003–2005. The 93 remaining sampled payments were 
appropriate.&nbsp; National Government Services, the Medicare Part B carrier for 
about 38,000 providers in New Jersey, processed 1,265 high-dollar payments 
during the audit period.<span style="font-size: 11.5pt">&nbsp; </span>Providers 
refunded four overpayments totaling $96,000 prior to our fieldwork and one 
$10,000 overpayment during our fieldwork.&nbsp; Two overpayments totaling $2,800 
remained outstanding.<br>
<br>
We recommended that National Government Services (1) recover the $2,800 in 
overpayments,&nbsp; (2) review the remaining 1,165 high-dollar claims processed 
during CYs 2003–2005 with potential overpayments estimated at $1.27 million 
($1.37 million less $109,000) and work with the providers that claimed these 
services to recover any overpayments, (3) consider identifying and recovering 
any additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part B claims paid after CY 
2005, and (4) use the results of this audit in its provider education 
activities. &nbsp;National Government Services agreed with our recommendations.</p>
