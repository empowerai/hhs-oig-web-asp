<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Our objective was to 
determine whether&nbsp;the prescription drug claims for which New York State received 
Federal reimbursement at the enhanced 90-percent rate of Federal financial 
participation (FFP) qualified as family planning services.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">New York State improperly
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">received Federal reimbursement at the 
enhanced 90-percent rate of FFP for 592,165 prescription drug claims that did 
not qualify as family planning services.&nbsp; As a result, the State improperly 
received $6,132,366 in Federal Medicaid funds.&nbsp; This amount represents the 
difference between the enhanced 90-percent rate and the applicable 50-percent or 
52.95-percent Federal medical assistance percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">We recommended that the 
State (1) </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">refund $6,132,366 to the Federal 
Government; (2) review all National Drug Codes (NDC) presently coded as family 
planning in the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to verify that 
they are related to family planning; (3) periodically review all NDCs to ensure 
that they are appropriately coded in the MMIS; and (4) determine the amount of 
Federal Medicaid funds improperly reimbursed at the 90-percent rate for 
non-family-planning NDCs, both prior and subsequent to our audit period, and 
refund that amount to the Federal Government.&nbsp; New York State generally 
concurred with our recommendations.</span></p>
