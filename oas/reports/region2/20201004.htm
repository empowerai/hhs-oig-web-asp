<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The objectives of our audit were to determine whether (1) 
Prospective Payment System (PPS) hospitals were paid in accordance with New York 
State (NYS) Medicaid policy when beneficiaries were transferred to other PPS 
hospitals, and (2) Medicaid overpayments resulted from the incorrect coding of 
the patient (discharge) status on claims for the transferred beneficiaries. For 
the most part, PPS hospitals in NYS were paid in accordance with Medicaid policy 
when beneficiaries were transferred to other PPS hospitals.&nbsp; However, we 
noted a relatively small number of exceptions that resulted from the incorrect 
coding of the patient (discharge) status on claims for the transferred 
beneficiaries.&nbsp; The NYS Department of Health (DOH) overpaid a total of $986,316 ($493,158 
Federal share) for 74 of the 185 claims reviewed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that NYS DOH (1) refund $493,158 to the 
Federal Government for its share of the identified overpayments, (2) research 
the economic feasibility of analyzing the remaining claims in our universe to 
determine if they resulted in overpayments to PPS hospitals, and (3) instruct 
hospitals to review all internal procedures and processes related to claims 
submission to assure that PPS transfers are properly reported.</p>
