<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This audit was part of a multistate review.&nbsp; Our objectives were to determine, for State fiscal year (SFY) 2003, whether New York: (1) calculated the category specific UPL for non-State government inpatient hospitals in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment and properly included UPL payments in the calculation of hospital-specific disproportionate share hospital limits, and (2) calculated the category-specific UPL and the transition period excess payment for non-State government nursing homes in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan.&nbsp; New York did calculate the SFY 2003 category-specific UPL for both hospitals and nursing homes in accordance with requirements and included hospital payments in the disproportionate share hospital limits.&nbsp; Contrary to Federal regulations, however, New York based its SFY 2003 transition period excess payment, totaling $674.3 million ($337.2 million Federal share), on estimated, rather than actual, Medicaid payment data from the base year.&nbsp; We expanded our review to include SFYs 2004 and 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that New York refund to the Federal Government $43.3 million in overpayments to non-State government nursing homes for SFYs 2003, 2004, and 2005.&nbsp; In response, New York officials did not specifically address our recommendation or the State’s use of estimated, rather than actual, Medicaid data.&nbsp; However, the officials took exception to our calculation of the overpayment amount.&nbsp; Our calculation of the transition period excess payments complied with the revised UPL regulations.&nbsp; We continue to recommend that New York refund the $43.3 million.</p>
