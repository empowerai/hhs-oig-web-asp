<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This audit addresses Medicaid payments for certain diagnostic and special education services for eligible students in
  New York for the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999.&nbsp; The New York Office of the State Comptroller (OSC)
  performed the review and it was conducted as part of our partnership efforts with State auditors to expand audit coverage
  of the Medicaid program.&nbsp; The OSC found that Medicaid might have inappropriately made between $33 million and $37.1
  million of School and Preschool payments during the 3-year period ending December 31, 1999.&nbsp; Most of the overpayments
  were attributed to a control weakness that was not corrected until December 31, 1997 by the New York City Board of Education,
  the agency responsible for submitting claims to the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS).&nbsp; While the New
  York City Board of Education officials corrected the weakness prior to the OSC audit, they did not take steps to repay
  the overpayment.&nbsp; The OSC recommended that the New York State Departments of Health (Health) and Education:&nbsp; (1)
  establish procedures to monitor Medicaid billings for duplicate claims between the School and Preschool programs and investigate
  the feasibility of implementing MMIS computer edits to prevent future payment of these claims; (2) investigate and recoup
  inappropriate School and Preschool Medicaid Payments; (3) implement procedures to monitor Medicaid billings for targeted
  care management claims to detect inappropriate Medicaid payments for TCM services; and (4) investigate to determine the
  reason the MMIS near duplicate computer edit did not detect and prevent Medicaid payments to more than one school district
  or county for the same recipient, service or rate code, and date of service.</p>
