<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Health Research, Incorporated (HRI) properly recorded, summarized
  and reported bio-terrorism preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement
  with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).&nbsp; HRI
  is the fiscal agent responsible for administering the Program grant on behalf of the New York City Department of Health
  and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).&nbsp; Our review found that HRI accounted for Program funds in accordance with the terms and
  conditions of the cooperative agreement with HRSA.&nbsp; Specifically, HRI recorded, summarized and reported transactions
  in discrete accounts established to account for bio-terrorism funding.&nbsp; We also found that, while HRI and DOHMH implemented
  controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient’s expenditures of HRSA funds, they are not currently performing on-site
  audits of sub-recipients.&nbsp; However, HRI and DOHMH indicated that they plan to add an on-site audit component to their
  monitoring procedures with funding from the Program.&nbsp; We recommended that HRI and DOHMH continue to implement plans
  to add an on-site audit component for monitoring sub-recipients and address problem areas, as they are identified.</p>
