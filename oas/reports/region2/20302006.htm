<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The audit objective was to determine whether HRSA complied with departmental policy limiting the carryover of unobligated Title I funds to one budget period.</p>
<p>HRSA did not always comply with departmental policy that, during the audit period, limited the carryover of unobligated grant balances to the next budget period only.&nbsp;Specifically, for grant years 1999&ndash;2003, HRSA authorized 46 of the 51 eligible areas to carry over unobligated Title I funds totaling $45,138,339 for periods ranging from 2 to 5 years beyond the original budget period.&nbsp;These funds, which were originally awarded to eligible areas to provide services during a specific budget period, were instead carried over for use in subsequent budget periods.</p>
<p>Departmental policy guidance issued after the audit period now permits the carryover of unobligated grant funds into either of the next two budget periods, but into no other subsequent period.</p>
<p>OIG recommended that HRSA comply with current departmental policy guidance related to the carryover of unobligated grant balances.&nbsp;HRSA concurred with the recommendation and stated that it now follows current departmental policy regarding the approval of carryover requests from Title I grantees.</p>
