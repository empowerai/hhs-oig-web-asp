<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of our review were to determine whether the State of New Jersey’s Department of Health
  and Senior Services (DHSS) properly recorded, summarized and reported bio-terrorism preparedness transactions in accordance
  with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health
  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and whether DHSS established controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipients’ expenditures
  of HRSA funds. &nbsp;We found that DHSS accounted for Program funds in accordance
  with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement with HRSA.&nbsp; Specifically, DHSS recorded, summarized and
  reported transactions in discrete accounts established to account for bio-terrorism funding.&nbsp; DHSS officials stated
  that HRSA funding had not been used to supplant existing State or local programs.&nbsp; DHSS did not perform site visits
  to its sub-recipients.&nbsp; We recommended that DHSS consider implementing a site visit component to its procedures for
  monitoring sub-recipients and address problem areas, as they are identified.&nbsp; New Jersey Officials concurred with
our recommendation.</p>
