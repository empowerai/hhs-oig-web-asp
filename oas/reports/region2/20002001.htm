<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The New York State Department of Family Assistance (NYSDFA) and its local social services districts are responsible for
  placing children in need of protection into foster care.&nbsp; Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, Federal matching
  of State foster care maintenance payments is available for children in foster care.&nbsp; In order to claim reimbursement
  from the Title IV-E program, the child must meet eligibility requirements and be placed in a foster boarding home that
  met State requirements for licensing, certification and approval.&nbsp; Based on our review, we found that the children
  were residing in homes that were in compliance with foster care eligibility requirements related to boarding home certifications
  and relative home approvals.</p>
