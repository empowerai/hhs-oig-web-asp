Review of Head Start Health and Safety Standards at Albany Community Action Partnership</h2>

<h2 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>


<p>As part of a series of reviews requested by the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Head Start, we found that Albany Community Action Partnership (the Grantee), located in New York State, did not fully comply with Federal and State requirements on ensuring the health and safety of children in its care.  The major objectives of the Head Start program include promoting school readiness and enhancing the social and cognitive development of low-income children by providing health, educational, nutritional, and social services.  In fiscal year 
(FY) 2009, Congress appropriated $7.1 billion to fund the Head Start program's regular operations.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides an additional $2.1 billion for the program during FYs 2009 and 2010.</p>

<p>As of June 2009, the files on 38 of the Grantee's 110 Head Start employees and 1 of the 6 contracted busdrivers showed that the Grantee had not obtained criminal background checks,   timely criminal background checks, or child abuse and maltreatment checks, and none of the 6 contracted busdrivers had been screened for tuberculosis.  In addition, the Grantee's nine childcare facilities that we reviewed did not meet all Federal Head Start and State regulations on protecting children from unsafe materials and equipment.  Finally, four of the nine childcare facilities that we reviewed did not provide a fully secure environment for the children in their care.  The Grantee's failure to consistently comply with requirements jeopardized the health and safety of children in its care.</p>

<p>We recommended that the Grantee develop and consistently follow procedures to ensure that 1) all employee and contracted busdriver files contain documentation of timely criminal background checks and child abuse and maltreatment register checks, (2) all contracted busdrivers have an initial health examination that includes screening for tuberculosis, (3) all unsanitary and unsafe conditions are corrected in a timely manner, and (4) all facilities are secure.  In comments on our draft report, the Grantee generally concurred with our findings and described its completed and ongoing actions to address deficiencies that we identified.</p>
