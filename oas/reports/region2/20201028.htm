<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out that New Jersey hired an outside contractor, under a contingency fee arrangement, to attempt
  to generate additional Federal reimbursement by identifying and submitting State expenditures, not previously claimed,
  for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, New Jersey inappropriately claimed health care costs (approximately $11.1
  million Federal share) applicable to prison inmates under Medicaid’s disproportionate share hospital program.&nbsp; The
  New Jersey State plan explicitly excluded Federal sharing in the costs of health services provided to prison inmates.&nbsp; Further,
  the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’s (CMS) guidance prohibited Federal sharing for prison inmate costs under
  the disproportionate share hospital program. We recommended that New Jersey refund $11.1 million to the Federal Government,
  adhere to its State plan requirements and CMS’s policy clarification when submitting future disproportionate share hospital
  claims for Federal reimbursement, and&nbsp; review all work performed by consultants to ensure the veracity of future Medicaid
  claims to the Federal Government.</p>
