<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Personal care involves services provided in the home to a recipient who requires varying degrees of assistance with activities
  of daily living such as hygiene, dressing, and feeding. New York spent Medicaid funds totaling $1.4 billion in 1990 on
  personal care services. Our audit report points out significant weaknesses with respect to documentation and billing of
  services rendered and the authorization of personal care services. For example, we found services billed by providers but
  not rendered and physicians prescribing services without current knowledge of the recipient's medical condition. These
  weaknesses raise serious questions as to the adequacy and appropriateness of care rendered to recipients. We also found
  that the State had not effectively monitored the program in Westchester County. We made recommendations to improve internal
  controls over the program and financial adjustments. Regional Health Care Financing Administration officials concurred
  with our findings and recommendations. </p>
