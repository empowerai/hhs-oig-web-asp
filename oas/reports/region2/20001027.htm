<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if controls were in place to preclude New Jersey from claiming Federal financial
  participation (FFP) under the Medicaid program for 21 to 64 year old residents of State operated psychiatric hospitals
  that were institutes for mental diseases (IMDs).&nbsp; The audit focused on individuals who were temporarily released to
  acute care hospitals for medical treatment.&nbsp; Our review found that improvements were needed in controls established
  by the State to preclude claiming FFP in such cases.&nbsp; For the period July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2001, the State
  improperly claimed $190,848 of FFP under the Medicaid program for inpatient acute care hospital services.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund $190,848 to the Federal Government; (2) identify and return the improper FFP claimed subsequent
  to June 30, 2001; and (3) strengthen procedures to ensure that claims for 21 to 64 year old residents of IMDs who receive
  medical services, including inpatient acute care hospital services, provided outside of the psychiatric hospitals, are
  not claimed for FFP.&nbsp; New Jersey officials agreed with our recommendations.</p>
