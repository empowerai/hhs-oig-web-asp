<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that South Jersey Rehabilitation Associates, Inc. (SJR) claimed payment for outpatient services
  that did not meet the Medicare criteria for reimbursement. Specifically, we identified charges for outpatient rehabilitation
  services which were not reasonable and necessary, lacked sufficient patient treatment plans, and/or were not properly supported
  by medical record documentation. Based on a statistical sample, we estimate that at least $241,774 was paid to SJR for
  unallowable charges. We also identified additional unallowable costs of $56,034 in owner's compensation and miscellaneous
  unsupported costs on SJR's 1997 Medicare cost report. During our audit, SJR voluntarily left the Medicare program. We are
  providing the results of our review to the fiscal intermediary so that it can make the appropriate financial adjustments. </p>
