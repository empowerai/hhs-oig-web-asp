<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether New Jersey calculated the upper payment limits (UPLs) for non-State
  government hospitals in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendments.&nbsp; Federal
  funds are not available for Medicaid payments that exceed the UPLs.&nbsp; We found that New Jersey
  calculated the state fiscal years (SFYs) 2001 and 2002 UPLs for non-State government hospitals’ inpatient
  services in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment.&nbsp; However,
  New Jersey did not calculate the SFY 2003 UPL in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved
  State plan amendment, which resulted in unallowable Medicaid payments of $17,579,568 ($8,789,784 Federal
  share).&nbsp; New Jersey generally calculated the UPLs for non-State government hospitals’ outpatient
  services in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment.&nbsp; However,
  New Jersey inadvertently applied an improper inflation factor in its SFY 2003 UPL calculation, resulting
  in unallowable Medicaid payments of $3,817,050 ($1,908,525 Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that
  New Jersey refund to the Federal Government unallowable Medicaid payments of $10,698,309.&nbsp; New
  Jersey officials concurred.</p>
