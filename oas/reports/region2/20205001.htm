<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Ryan
    White Title I payments totaling $2,564,680 made by the San Juan Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) to Ryder Memorial Hospital
    (Ryder) for medical services rendered to HIV/AIDS patients during the period&nbsp;&nbsp; March 1, 1998 through February
    28, 2001 were for reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs.&nbsp; We found that the San Juan EMA reimbursed Ryder a
    total of $352,094 for services that were not reasonable, allocable, or allowable, as outlined in Federal guidelines issued
    by the Office of Management and Budget.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements.&nbsp; The
San Juan EMA concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
