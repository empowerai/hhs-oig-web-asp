<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Federal Medicaid payments for transportation services claimed
  by the New York City Department of Education (NYCDE) were in compliance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; None
  of the120 transportation claims in our statistically valid sample complied with all Federal and State
  requirements.&nbsp; Specifically:&nbsp; (1) for 119 claims, we were unable to verify that the transportation
  services billed were rendered; (2) for 97 claims, a Medicaid-covered school health service other than
  transportation was not rendered on days when transportation was billed; (3) Eight claims lacked any
  documentation at all; (4) for 33 claims, no child’s plan/family plan was provided or the plan was untimely;
  and, (5) thirty-six claims did not include a recommendation for transportation services in the child’s
  plan/family plan.&nbsp; Based on our sample, we estimate that $96,110,877 in Federal Medicaid funding
  was unallowable.&nbsp; We “set aside” other claims totaling an estimated $12,130,322 in Federal Medicaid
  funding for consideration by CMS and the State because Federal Medicaid law and regulations require
  that services be documented but do not specify how transportation services should be documented.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund $96,110,877 to the Federal Government; (2) work with
  CMS to resolve $12,130,322 in set-aside claims; (3) instruct NYCDE to bill transportation based on
  the actual number of transportation services rendered, not based on averages; (4) provide proper guidance
  on Federal and State Medicaid criteria to NYCDE; (5) reinforce the need for NYCDE to comply with Federal
  and State requirements; (6) improve its monitoring of NYCDE’s transportation claims to ensure compliance
  with Federal and State requirements; and (7) instruct NYCDE to maintain appropriate documentation to
  support its Medicaid transportation claims.&nbsp; In February 14, 2005, comments on our draft report,
  State officials disagreed with most aspects of the report, including the audit period, approach, criteria,
  and conclusions, and stated that the draft report should be withdrawn.&nbsp; We disagree with most
  of the State’s comments and continue to believe that Medicaid school health providers need to follow
  the documentation standards required of all Medicaid providers.</p>
