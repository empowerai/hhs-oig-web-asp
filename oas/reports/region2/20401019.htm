<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<div class="Section1">
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
	<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Health Department overstated State 
	Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 
	expenditures on its fiscal year (FY) 2002 CMS 64.21U report by $28,301,865 (Federal share 
	$18,396,212).&nbsp; Despite the reporting error, the overstatement did not have a 
	financial impact on Federal funds.&nbsp; In addition, contrary to Federal 
	regulations,<font color="black"><span style="COLOR: black"> </span></font>
	the Health Department retained SCHIP expenditure data for as little as 6 
	months.&nbsp; Nothing came to our attention to indicate that improper SCHIP 
	payments were made because of missing documentation.&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	We recommended that the Health Department:&nbsp; (1) reduce expenditures 
	reported on the FY 2002<b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> </span></b>CMS 
	64.21U by $28,301,865 (Federal share $18,396,212), (2) establish procedures 
	to reconcile SCHIP expenditures on its CMS 64.21U reports to the 
	Commonwealth’s Medicaid Development Information System to prevent any future 
	overstatements, and (3) implement procedures for retaining records that 
	comply with Federal regulations. &nbsp;The Health 
	Department concurred with our findings and recommendations.</span></font></div>
