<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Federal regulations require states to pursue Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayments made prior to October 1, 
1996, and make appropriate refunds to the Federal Government.&nbsp; This follow-up 
report points out that the State agency refunded to the Federal Government the 
estimated Federal share of AFDC overpayments totaling $33.6 million recovered by 
the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) during the period 
December 1, 1996, through September 30, 2001, as recommended in our prior report 
(A-02-01-02000).&nbsp; However, the State agency did not implement our recommendation 
to take appropriate steps to refund the Federal share of AFDC overpayments 
recoveries collected by HRA subsequent to September 30, 2001.&nbsp; As a result, the 
State agency did not refund the estimated Federal share of AFDC overpayments 
totaling $896,711 recovered by HRA during the period October 1, 2001, through 
September 30, 2006.&nbsp; State agency officials concurred with our recommendation 
that the State refund the $896,711 to the Federal Government but objected to our 
second recommendation that the State agency ensure that AFDC overpayment 
recoveries collected after September 30, 2006, are refunded to the Federal 
Government in a timely manner.</p>
