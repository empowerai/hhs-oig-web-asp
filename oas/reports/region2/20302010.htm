<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review was to determine whether the
    New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and the Medical and Health Research Association of New
    York City (MHRA) properly recorded, summarized and reported bio-terrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus
    areas designated in cooperative agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found that DOHMH and MHRA accounted for bio-terrorism program
    funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC).&nbsp; DOHMH officials stated that CDC funding had not been used to supplant existing State and
    local programs.&nbsp; In addition, we found that MHRA has adequate controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures
of CDC funds.</p>
