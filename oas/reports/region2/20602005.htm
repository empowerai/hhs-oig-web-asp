<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Federal regulations require States to offset Child Support 
Enforcement program costs by recognizing and reporting program income from 
undistributable child support collections and interest earned on child support 
collections.&nbsp; States report to the Federal Government undistributable 
collections and program income quarterly on Federal Forms OCSE-34A and 
OCSE-396A.&nbsp; For the period October 1, 1998, through March 31, 2006, the State 
agency did not recognize or report program income of $281,990 ($186,113 Federal 
share) for the undistributable child support collections and related interest.&nbsp; 
In addition, during the same period, the State did not accurately report 
undistributable child support collections quarterly on its OCSE-34A to the 
Federal Government.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency (1) report $281,990 
($186,113 Federal share) as program income to the Federal Government and (2) 
provide program oversight and implement procedures and controls to ensure that undistributable collections and interest are identified and accurately reported 
as program income on Forms OCSE-34A and OCSE-396A.&nbsp; State agency officials 
concurred with our recommendations.</p>
