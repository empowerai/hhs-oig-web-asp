<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to ascertain whether (1) Medicaid payments to Patterson were adequate
  to cover its operating costs and (2) a link could be drawn between the quality of care that Patterson
  provided to its residents and the amount of Medicaid funding received.&nbsp; We found that total, or
  gross, Medicaid payments to Patterson were adequate to cover Medicaid-related costs, but net payments
  were not.&nbsp; During the 3 years ended September 30, 2001, Patterson’s Medicaid operating costs were
  about $190 million.&nbsp; During the same period, gross Medicaid payments totaled $348 million- $145
  million in per diem payments and $203 million in enhanced payments available under the upper-payment-limit
  regulations.&nbsp; However, the State established per diem rates that were significantly lower than
  actual costs, and the State and the county required Patterson to return about 90 percent of its upper-payment-limit
  funding. Accordingly, the Medicaid funding that Patterson retained was $25 million less than its total
  Medicaid operating costs.</p>
<p>As designed, the State’s upper-payment-limit funding approach using intergovernmental transfers benefited
  the State and the county more than Patterson. We are concerned that the Federal Government provided
  almost all of Patterson’s Medicaid funding, contrary to the principle that Medicaid is a shared responsibility
  of the Federal and State Governments. Another result was that Patterson was understaffed, which may
  have affected the quality of care provided to its residents.&nbsp; Patterson officials believed that
  they could improve quality of care if they had more funds to hire additional nursing and specialized
  staff, provide more training, and improve security and resident safety.&nbsp; We recommended that the
  State (1) consider revising Patterson’s Medicaid per diem rate to more closely reflect operating costs,
  and (2) allow Patterson to retain sufficient funding to cover the costs of providing an adequate level
  of care to its residents.&nbsp; The State did not agree with our conclusions and recommendations.</p>
