<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this audit was to determine whether 
Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to University Behavioral 
Healthcare Center (UBHC) for State fiscal years 1996 through 2001 complied with 
the hospital-specific limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Social Security 
Act (the Act) and the approved State plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">DSH payments to UBHC exceeded the hospital-specific 
limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Act and the approved State plan by 
$20,075,738 ($10,037,869 Federal share).&nbsp; Further, we were unable to determine 
the reasonableness of $9,881,400 ($4,940,700 Federal share) of costs included in 
UBHC’s hospital-specific DSH limits because the contractor included an 
undetermined amount of costs for patients with private insurance coverage. &nbsp;New 
Jersey officials told us that they had relied on the contractor to prepare the 
DSH claims and that, contrary to Federal requirements, they had not ensured the 
veracity of those claims before submitting them for Federal reimbursement. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We recommended that New Jersey (1) refund $10,037,869 to 
the Federal Government, (2) work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) to resolve $4,940,700 in set-aside costs, (3) adhere to Federal 
law and State plan requirements when submitting DSH claims subsequent to June 
2001 for Federal reimbursement, and (4) review all work performed by consultants 
to ensure the veracity of future Medicaid claims to the Federal Government.&nbsp; New 
Jersey officials generally agreed with the findings and recommendations.</p>
