<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that New Jersey claimed duplicate reimbursement 
  for acute care hospital claims totaling approximately $54.9 million (federal 
  share $27.5 million) under the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) program.&nbsp; 
  The state blamed the error on a computer system's error of a contractor hired 
  by the state, on a contingency fee basis, to generate increased federal reimbursement 
  by identifying and submitting state expenses not previously claimed.&nbsp; We 
  recommended that New Jersey refund $30.4 million (which includes interest applicable 
  to the overpayment) to the Federal Government.&nbsp; We also recommended that 
  the state thoroughly review all work performed by outside contractors and consultants 
  to assure the veracity of future claims to the Federal Government.</p>
