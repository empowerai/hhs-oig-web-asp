<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the review was to evaluate the accounting controls and processes 
  for recording and reporting expenses, liabilities and cash expenditures for 
  checks returned or withheld from Medicare providers under the &quot;Do Not Forward 
  (DNF) Initiative.&quot;&nbsp; The review identified system limitations and weaknesses 
  in the implementation of the DNF guidelines that resulted in misstatements totaling 
  $4,845,530 in Region II carriers’ financial reports.&nbsp; We recommended that 
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regional office work with 
  its contractors to effectively implement the DNF guidelines, assure that the 
  misstatements of the financial reports have been properly resolved, and follow 
  up with the contractors to ensure that their financial reports are accurately 
  prepared.&nbsp; The CMS regional office concurred with the recommendations.&nbsp; 
  Since the system limitations identified by this review could affect contractors 
  outside Region II, this matter has also been referred to the CMS central office 
  for further consideration.</p>
