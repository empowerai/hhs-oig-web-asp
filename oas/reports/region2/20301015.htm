<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that $106.7 million of contractual service costs claimed as eligible disproportionate share hospital
  (DSH) expenditures were allowable for Federal funding.&nbsp; However, contrary to applicable provisions of the Social Security
  Act and the New Jersey State plan, $3.7 million ($1.8 million Federal share) was improperly claimed for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; This
  is the fourth in a series of reports on Medicaid DSH claims prepared by a consultant under a contingency fee contract and
  submitted by New Jersey for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; The Senate Finance Committee is investigating Medicaid revenue-maximizing
  arrangements between States and private consulting firms and requested the results of this review.&nbsp; The State concurred
  with our recommendations.&nbsp; We recommended that New Jersey (1) refund $1.8 million to the Federal Government, (2) adhere
  to Federal law and State plan requirements when submitting future DSH claims for Federal reimbursement, and (3) review
  all work performed by consultants to ensure the veracity of future Medicaid claims to the Federal Government.</p>
