<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the State of New Jersey
    Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) properly recorded, summarized and reported bio-terrorism preparedness
    transactions by specific focus areas designated in the cooperative agreements.&nbsp; In addition, we inquired as to whether
    bio-terrorism funding supplanted programs previously funded by other organizational sources and whether DHSS established
    controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient’s expenditures of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds.&nbsp; Our
    review found that DHSS accounted for bio-terrorism program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative
    agreements with CDC.&nbsp; DHSS officials stated that CDC funding had not been used to supplant existing State and local
    programs.&nbsp; DHSS did not perform site visits to its sub-recipients.&nbsp; We recommended that DHSS consider implementing
    a site visit component to its procedures for monitoring sub-recipients and address problem areas, as they are identified.&nbsp; New
Jersey Officials concurred with our recommendation.</p>
