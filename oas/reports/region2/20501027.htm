<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For calendar year 2004, St. Elizabeth Medical Center’s (St. 
Elizabeth) nursing and allied health education programs met both Medicare 
program eligibility and cost reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Pursuant to Federal 
regulations, a provider that has transferred ownership of a previously 
provider-operated program to a wholly owned subsidiary educational institution 
may receive reasonable Medicare cost payments.&nbsp; For transfers prior to October 
1, 2003, Medicare reimburses the provider for clinical training costs and 
classroom courses included in the previously provider-operated program.&nbsp; In 
1997, St. Elizabeth restructured its nursing education program.&nbsp; Therefore, 
costs related to classroom courses added to the program after the transfer are 
not eligible for Medicare payment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In its comments on the draft report, St. Elizabeth stated 
that it added a course to its nursing education program after transferring 
ownership of the program and provided documentation that the course was a 
clinical course with no classroom time.&nbsp; Based on the new documentation 
provided, the report contains no recommendations.</p>
