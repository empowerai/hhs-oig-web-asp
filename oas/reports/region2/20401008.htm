<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether New York University Hospitals Center (the Hospital)
  included the appropriate number of dental residents in its full-time equivalent (FTE) counts
  when computing Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments for calendar years (CYs)
  2000 through 2002.&nbsp; The Hospital inappropriately included dental residents in its FTE
  counts for CY 2002.&nbsp; Contrary to Federal regulations, the Hospital (1) inaccurately
  recorded resident days worked and (2) inappropriately claimed the time of a resident who
  had exceeded his initial residency period.&nbsp; The number of FTE residents claimed by the
  Hospital included didactic time, i.e., classroom time, for residents when working in nonhospital
  settings.</p>
<p>We recommended that the Hospital:&nbsp; (1) file an amended cost report to refund of $10,783
  associated with the overstated FTEs; (2) use the results of this audit to help educate staff;
  (3) determine whether errors similar to those identified in our review occurred in Medicare
  cost reports after CY 2002 and refund any overpayments; and (4) work with CMS to resolve
  the FTEs corresponding to the didactic time of residents assigned to nonhospital settings.&nbsp; The
  Hospital concurred with three of our four recommendations.&nbsp; The Hospital acknowledged
  that it claimed the didactic time of residents assigned to nonhospital settings but believed
  that the time was allowable.</p>
