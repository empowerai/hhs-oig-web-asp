<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Federal regulations require States to pursue Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayments made prior to October 1, 
1996, and make 
appropriate refunds to the Federal Government.&nbsp; This 
follow-up report points out that the State agency refunded to the Federal 
Government the estimated Federal share of AFDC overpayments totaling $1.8 
million recovered by Chemung, Erie, Monroe, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties (the 
local districts) during the period December 1, 1996, through April 30, 2002, as 
recommended in our prior report (A-02-02-02001). <span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span>However, 
the State agency did not implement our recommendation to ensure that the Federal 
share of AFDC overpayment recoveries collected by the local districts subsequent 
to April 30, 2002, were returned to the Federal Government in a timely manner.&nbsp; 
As a result, the State agency did not refund the estimated Federal share of AFDC 
overpayments totaling $347,375 recovered by the local districts during the 
period May 1, 2002, through January 31, 2007.&nbsp; We recommended that the 
State agency (1) refund $347,375 to the Federal Government and (2) ensure that 
the Federal share of AFDC overpayment recoveries collected by the local 
districts subsequent to January 31, 2007, are refunded to the Federal Government 
in a timely manner.&nbsp; State agency officials did not dispute the estimate of $347,375 to the Federal 
Government.</p>
