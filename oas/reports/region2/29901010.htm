<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that many of the outpatient psychiatric services claimed by Saint Vincent Hospital did not
  meet the Medicare criteria for reimbursement. Specifically, charges for outpatient psychiatric services lacked sufficient
  patient treatment plans, lacked sufficient medical record documentation, and/or were not reasonable and necessary. We estimated,
  based on a statistical sample, that at least $2,261,155 in such charges for calendar year 1997 were unallowable. In addition
  to a financial adjustment, we recommended that the Hospital strengthen its procedures to ensure that charges for outpatient
  psychiatric services are reasonable and necessary and properly documented in accordance with Medicare regulations and guidelines. </p>
