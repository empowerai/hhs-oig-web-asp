<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Senate Finance Committee requested that we assess the 
fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations with respect 
to six specified fiscal integrity areas.&nbsp; Of the $11.3 million of costs 
reviewed, $11.1 million appeared reasonable for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; Of the 
remaining costs, the Island Peer Review Organization, Inc. (IPRO), incurred 
$77,358 of costs that were unallowable and $157,218 of costs that may not have 
complied with Federal requirements.<br>
<br>
We recommended that IPRO (1) refund $6,755 of unallowable duplicate meal costs, 
(2) reduce the indirect cost pool by $10,000 for unallowable board of directors 
compensation, (3) refund $60,603 of incorrectly classified direct costs and 
increase the indirect cost pool accordingly, and (4) work with the CMS 
contracting officer to determine what portion of the $157,218 
conference-related costs claimed during the audit period were unreasonable and 
therefore unallowable and so should be refunded.&nbsp; IPRO generally disagreed with 
the findings.</p>
