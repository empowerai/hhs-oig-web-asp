<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether Group Health 
Incorporated’s (GHI) high-dollar Medicare payments to Part B providers were 
appropriate.&nbsp; During calendar years 2003–2005, GHI processed 14 Part B payments 
of $10,000 or more.&nbsp; Eleven of the fourteen high-dollar payments that GHI made to providers were appropriate.&nbsp; However, Group Health 
Incorporated overpaid providers $84,092 for the remaining three payments.&nbsp; 
Providers refunded two of the overpayments, totaling $69,394, prior to our 
fieldwork, and one overpayment of $14,698 remained outstanding.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">We recommended that GHI (1) recover the $14,698 overpayment and (2) consider 
identifying and recovering any additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part 
B claims paid after calendar year 2005.&nbsp; GHI agreed with 
our recommendations.</p>
