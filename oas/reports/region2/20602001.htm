<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">We found that the 197 grants that the Department’s Division 
of Payment Management (DPM) had identified as eligible for closeout as of March 
31, 2006, remained open in the Payment Management System for several reasons.&nbsp; 
DPM is responsible for recording grant activity in the payment system and 
closing grants after receiving closeout instructions from CMS’s Office of 
Financial Management.&nbsp; CMS’s program offices, the Center for Medicaid &amp; State 
Operations and the Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, are responsible 
for initiating closeout of grants.&nbsp; As a general rule, grants must be closed 
within 180 days after the end of the grant period (the cutoff date).<br>
<br>
For 33 grants with unexpended balances totaling $1.2 billion, the program 
offices did not initiate closeout because they were awaiting the results of 
legislative proposals to use the expired funds for other purposes or because 
they lacked an adequate monitoring system to ensure that grants were closed by 
the cutoff date.&nbsp; For 164 grants with unexpended balances totaling $104.2 
million, the program offices did initiate closeout.&nbsp; However, DPM did not 
complete closeout primarily because of differences (sometimes of $1 or less) 
among the grant award, expenditure, and drawdown amounts in the payment system.<br>
<br>
We recommended that CMS (1) ensure that the program offices close grants by the 
cutoff date by establishing an adequate monitoring system, (2) deobligate any 
unexpended balances on grants open past the cutoff date, and (3) work with DPM 
to establish a dollar threshold for differences in payment system balances and 
procedures for closing grants with differences below the threshold.&nbsp; CMS 
generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
