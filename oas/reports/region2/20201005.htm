<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review 
  were to determine whether termination costs claimed by Horizon were allowable, 
  allocable and reasonable.  
  Our audit of Horizon’s Medicare Part A termination costs claimed on six termination 
  cost vouchers for the period August 2000 through May 2001, which totaled $3,736,186, 
  disclosed that the reported costs were overstated by $1,832,896.&nbsp; Specifically, 
  reported termination costs improperly included:&nbsp; $1,804,000 of unfunded 
  post retirement benefits, $15,529 of unallowable legal fees, $11,367 of severance 
  pay related to non-Medicare employee functions and, $2,000 of employee training 
  that did not benefit Medicare.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment for 
  $1,832,896.</p>
