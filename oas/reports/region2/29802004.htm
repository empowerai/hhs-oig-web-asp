<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The New York State Department of Family Assistance (NYSDFA) (formerly the New York State Department of Social Services)
  awarded a contract to the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) to implement and administer a Federal Revenue
  Maximization Project (FRMP) designed to generate increased Federal funding. According to the terms of the contract, NYSDFA
  was to pay NYSAC a fee contingent on the revenue generated under the FRMP.&nbsp; We reviewed a statistical sample of 100
  foster care cases, totaling $1,268,262 (Federal share $634,131), which NYSDFA retroactively claimed to the Title IV-E Foster
  Care program.&nbsp; We found that 7 of the 100 cases reviewed contained claims that were ineligible for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; The
  total amount improperly claimed to the Title IV-E Foster Care program for the 7 errors was $25,372 (Federal share $12,686).</p>
