<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">New Jersey did not provide support for $10.9 million ($4.3 
million Federal share) of the $13.1 million that it claimed for Medicaid family 
planning services from July 1, 1997, through March 31, 2002.&nbsp; Medicaid 
reimburses the State’s family planning services at an enhanced 90-percent rate.&nbsp; 
Because we were unable to determine the appropriateness of these claims, we have 
set aside these costs for resolution by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services (CMS).&nbsp; Of the $2.2 million in documented claims, the State included 
$786,000 ($314,000 Federal share) in unallowable costs related to infertility 
services.&nbsp; The remaining claims were submitted in compliance with Federal and 
State requirements.&nbsp; State officials indicated that they had relied on a 
consultant to prepare the retroactive family planning claims and that, contrary 
to Federal requirements, they had not ensured the veracity of those claims. <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) work with CMS to resolve the $4.3 million in 
set-aside costs, (2) refund $314,000 to the Federal Government,<a name="tm_469763493">
</a>(3) adhere to Federal and State requirements when submitting family planning 
claims for Federal reimbursement, and<a name="tm_469763497"> </a>(4) review all 
work performed by consultants to ensure the veracity of future Medicaid claims 
to the Federal Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;The State agreed with our recommendations.</p>
