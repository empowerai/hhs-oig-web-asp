<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, we 
estimated that Arizona paid approximately $500,000 ($335,000 Federal share) for 
Medicaid services provided to beneficiaries who should not have been eligible 
owing to their Medicaid eligibility/residence in California. &nbsp;Both Arizona and 
California require that Medicaid beneficiaries be residents.<br>
<br>
We recommended that Arizona work with the California Medicaid agency to share 
available Medicaid eligibility information for use in determining accurate 
beneficiary eligibility status and reducing the amount of payments, estimated to 
be approximately $500,000&nbsp;($335,000 Federal share), made on behalf of 
beneficiaries residing in California.&nbsp; Arizona acknowledged its obligation to 
review beneficiaries’ eligibility and identified several issues that it believed 
would reduce the reported payments.&nbsp; We reviewed Arizona’s comments and maintain 
that our findings remain valid.</p>
