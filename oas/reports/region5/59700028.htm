<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>A prior audit had disclosed, based on a statistical sample, that Ohio had made 
  overpayments to hospitals and long term care facilities totaling $29.3 million 
  (Federal share $17.6 million) during the 4-year period ending December 1992. 
  A financial adjustment was recommended. In response the State contracted with 
  Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group to conduct a review of the overpayment 
  conditions we identified and initiate a retroactive recovery process. Deloitte 
  and Touche's review covered the period January 1, 1989 through May 31, 1996 
  (a longer period than was covered by our prior audit. The objective of our follow-up 
  audit was to determine the reasonableness of the methodology used by Deloitte 
  and Touche in their review. We found Deloitte and Touche's methodology to identify 
  Medicaid overpayments to be reasonable. We concur with Deloitte and Touche's 
  overpayment findings totaling $34.0 million (Federal share $20.5 million) and 
  recommend the State make a financial adjustment for this amount. State agency 
  officials concurred with our recommendation. </p>
