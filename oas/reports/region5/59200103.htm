<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report points out the results of our review of Health and Safety Standards 
  at Child Care Facilities in Wisconsin. The State needs to improve health and 
  safety conditions as well as recordkeeping at the facilities. We found 755 violations 
  of State codes and areas where improvements can be made. The violations ranged 
  from discrepancies in employees' records such as missing character or personal 
  reference checks and incomplete children's medical records to fire code violations 
  and unsanitary conditions. We recommended actions the State should take to strengthen 
  compliance with health and safety standards. </p>
