<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Ohio Department of Health (State agency): (i) properly recorded, summarized
  and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus area designated in the cooperative agreements and
  (ii) whether the State agency had controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of CDC funds.&nbsp; Based
  on our validation of a questionnaire completed by the State agency and our site visit, we found that the State agency generally
  accounted for program funds by specific focus area.&nbsp; In response to our inquiry as to whether the State agency reduced
  funding to existing public health programs, State officials replied that program funding had not been used to supplant
  existing State or local programs. We recommended that the State agency implement the site visit component and address problem
  areas, as they are identified.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with our findings and recommendation.</p>
