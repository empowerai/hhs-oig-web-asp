<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</B></P>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine the amount of Medicaid overpayments resulting from providers billing for
  medical services for dates after the beneficiaries&#8217; death.&nbsp; We found that for the period October 1, 1998 through
  September 30, 2001, the New York State Department of Health did not identify all payments for medical services provided
  after death.&nbsp; In a statistical sample of 100 paid claims, where the beneficiaries&#8217; death occurred within our
  audit period, we found 5 payments amounting to $401 for services billed to Medicaid beneficiaries after their deaths.&nbsp; We
  also found 24 additional payments for which the beneficiary had multiple indications of death. Based on the projected results
  of our statistical sample, we estimate that $6.7 million in payments were made to beneficiaries with multiple indicators
  of death.&nbsp; The lack of access to death certificates prevented us from making a conclusive determination of the amount
  of overpayments.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency determine whether the beneficiary died prior to the Medicaid
  provider's billed date of service and recover any overpayments,&nbsp; expand data sharing between the State agency&#8217;s
  and New York City&#8217;s Medicaid and Vital Records Offices, and consider using the SSA death file to improve data matching
  and to enhance identification of Medicaid deceased beneficiaries.&nbsp; New York officials generally agreed with the recommendations
  and initiated corrective actions.</p>
