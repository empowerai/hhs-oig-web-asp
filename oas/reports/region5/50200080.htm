<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the Medicaid and Medicare 
  credit balances recorded on Aurora Sinai Medical Center’s accounting records 
  for inpatient and outpatient services represented overpayments reportable to 
  the Medicaid and Medicare programs.&nbsp; We found that the provider did not 
  always identify and report overpayments in a timely manner to the Medicaid and 
  Medicare programs.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that the provider’s policies and 
  procedures were not in accordance with state and federal regulations.&nbsp; 
  As a result, estimated Medicaid overpayments of $515,498 and Medicare overpayments 
  of $637 were not reported to the programs in a timely manner.&nbsp; During our 
  fieldwork, the Medicare program recovered $193 of the overpayments.&nbsp; We 
  recommend that Aurora Sinai Medical Center:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;ensure Medicaid and 
  Medicare overpayments of $515,498 and $444, respectively, are recovered by the 
  programs; (2)&nbsp;revise policies and procedures to ensure that existing and 
  future overpayments are identified and reported; and (3)&nbsp;submit adjustment 
  request forms for unreported Medicaid overpayments.&nbsp; Generally, Aurora 
  Sinai concurred with the results of our review and has already initiated corrective 
  actions with regards to the recommendations.</p>
