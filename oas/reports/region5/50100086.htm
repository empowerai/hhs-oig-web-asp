<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review 
  was to determine if payments to BlueCross (Contract H3953) were appropriate 
  for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; The final report points 
  out that BlueCross received Medicare overpayments totaling $62,432 for 99 beneficiaries 
  incorrectly reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 
  through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; Forty-four of the beneficiaries did not meet 
  the 30-day residency requirement for the month claimed in an institution.&nbsp; 
  For 37 other beneficiaries, there was no evidence of institutional residency 
  for the month(s) questioned.&nbsp; The remaining 18 beneficiaries were residents 
  of domiciliary facilities not certified for Medicare or Medicaid.
