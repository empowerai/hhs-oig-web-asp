<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service 
  claims paid for beneficiaries incarcerated in Michigan during the 3-year period 
  of January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with Federal 
  regulations and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services guidelines. Michigan 
  was 1 of 10 States selected for review. Generally, no Medicare payments should 
  be made when a beneficiary is in State or local custody under a penal authority, 
  since the State or other government component is responsible for providing medical 
  care. We found in Michigan that three of the 100 sample claims were unallowable. 
  The sample also included 63 claims for beneficiaries in psychiatric hospitals 
  operated by the Michigan Department of Community Health. We determined that 
  these beneficiaries did qualify for Medicare coverage because under State law, 
  the beneficiaries were responsible for repayment of medical costs and the State 
  did pursue collection. Thirty additional claims in our sample were also allowable 
  because we believe the beneficiaries were not incarcerated on the day of the 
  medical service. We were unable to determine the incarceration status of the 
  beneficiaries for four claims in our sample. </p>
