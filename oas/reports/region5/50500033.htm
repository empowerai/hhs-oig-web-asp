<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Michigan Department of Human Services, Office
  of Child Support (State agency) appropriately reported program income for undistributable
  child support collections and interest earned on program funds.&nbsp; The State agency did
  not recognize program income of $6,662,322 ($4,397,133&nbsp;Federal share) for unclaimed
  collections held by Friend of the Court offices that should have been considered abandoned
  and transferred to the State Treasurer pursuant to State law.&nbsp; The State agency did
  not report program income totaling $390,695 ($257,859 Federal share) for undistributable
  child support collections that were transferred to the State Treasurer for the quarters ended
  December 1998 through December 2004.&nbsp; 
  In addition, the State agency could not provide documentation to support resolution of a
  prior Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) Division of Audit finding and recommendation
  regarding undistributable collections totaling $1,121,298 ($740,057 Federal share) that were
  not reported as program income.</p>
<p> We recommended that the State agency: (1) require the Friend of the Court offices to transfer
  the unclaimed collections to the Unclaimed Property Division and report program income for
  undistributable collections totaling $6,662,322 ($4,397,133 Federal share); (2) report program
  income for undistributable collections of $390,695 ($257,859 Federal share) that were transferred
  to the State Treasurer; (3) provide program oversight to ensure that undistributable collections
  are identified and reported as program income on the quarterly Federal financial report (Form
  OCSE&#8209;396A); (4) implement adequate policies, procedures, and controls to ensure that
  undistributable child support collections reported on the quarterly report of collections
  (Form OCSE&#8209;34A) are recognized as program income on Form OCSE&#8209;396A; and (5) work
  with OCSE to resolve the recommendation from 1999 to adjust for undistributable collections
  totaling $1,121,298 ($740,057 Federal share) not reported as program income.&nbsp; 
  The State agency generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
