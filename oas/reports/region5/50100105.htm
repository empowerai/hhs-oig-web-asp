<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p></p> The objective of this review 
  was to determine if the Pennsylvania Medicaid program was reimbursing providers 
  amounts in excess of State Medicare limits for durable medical equipment (DME) 
  and supplies used to provide oxygen.&nbsp; We found that the Medicaid program 
  was overcharged approximately $3.4 million due to excessive Medicaid reimbursement 
  rates.&nbsp; The excessive reimbursements occurred because the State agency 
  set the reimbursement limits for these items above the dollar amount allowed 
  for similar items under the Medicare program and other State Medicaid programs.&nbsp; 
  We recommended that the State refund the Medicaid program $3,378,481 (Federal 
  share $1,813,649) for excessive reimbursements to providers and limit the maximum 
  allowable price for DME and supplies to an amount equal to or less than the 
  Medicare allowable amount for the same items.&nbsp; A State agency official 
  generally concurred with our recommendations.</p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/bottom.lbi" -->
