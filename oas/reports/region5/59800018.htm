<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Allopathic Medicine 
  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at the State University of New 
  York (SUNY) Health Sciences Center at Brooklyn. The HPSL program was implemented 
  through the Public Health Service Act. The Health Resources and Services Administration 
  (HRSA) has overall management responsibilities for the program at the Federal 
  level. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We determined that the University was appropriately using HPSL funds to provide 
  loans to eligible medical students and was in compliance with regulations concerning 
  the use of investment income and maintenance to excess cash. However, we determined 
  that a number of borrowers were not in compliance with the primary care service 
  obligations criteria established by HRSA. We also determined that the University 
  was carrying uncollectible loans in their accounting records and that edits 
  were not in place to alert university officials to the expiration of the ten-year 
  repayment period. </p>
