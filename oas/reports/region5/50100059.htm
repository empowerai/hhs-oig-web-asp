<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether (1) disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments
  were calculated in accordance with the approved State plan and the hospital-specific limit requirements of section 1923(g)
  of the Social Security Act and (2) State-owned institution for mental disease (IMD) facilities were qualified to receive
  DSH payments.&nbsp; Regarding the first objective, the State did not make retroactive adjustments as required by the State
  plan for limiting the DSH payments to the hospital-specific DSH limits.&nbsp; From our review of two acute care hospitals,
  we found that the procedures used by the State did not prevent significant DSH overpayments.&nbsp; Regarding the second
  objective, 1 of 10 State-owned IMD facilities that received DSH payments did not qualify for these payments because it
  did not have the minimum required 1-percent Medicaid inpatient utilization rate.&nbsp; We recommended that Illinois (1)
  refund $972,810 to the Federal Government and (2) develop a process to evaluate the ongoing compliance of IMD facilities
  with the DSH requirements.</p>
