<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of the audit was to determine whether services performed by the Arnett Health Plan Inc.’s
  capitated provider were also being reimbursed under the Medicare fee-for-service payment system.&nbsp; We
  determined that Arnett's capitated provider filed Medicare claims, for which they were paid on a fee-for-service
  basis, while under a capitation arrangement with Arnett.&nbsp; The capitation arrangement, which provides
  for a per member, per month payment to Arnett's capitated provider, covered allowable service performed
  by the provider to Arnett's enrollees.&nbsp; Medicare reimbursed Arnett for the capitation payments
  made to the provider by Medicare are considered overpayments.&nbsp; During our audit period, inappropriate
  Medicare fee-for service billings by Arnett's capitated provider amounted to $111,862.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that Arnett recover the $111,862 in duplicate Medicare fee-for-service claims made
  to the capitated provider and that Arnett develop an efficient and effective system to preclude and
  detect duplicate payments from the capitated provider.&nbsp; Arnett Health Plan, Inc. refunded $24,042
  to Medicare and that the remaining $87,820 will be refunded.&nbsp; Arnett has taken action to enhance
  their duplicate payments policies and procedures.</p>
