<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether administrative costs claimed by the State agency
  for the Medicaid Family Care waiver program were identified and separately reported, properly allocated, and reasonable
  and allowable.&nbsp; Although the State agency generally exercised adequate control over administrative costs claimed amounting
  to $10.2 million (Federal share), it needs to improve (1) segregating and reporting of waiver administrative costs, (2)
  updating of county cost allocation rates for information and assistance costs, and (3) screening for unreasonable and unallowable
  county expenditures.&nbsp; We also recommended financial adjustments for unallocable and unallowable costs totaling $129,663
  (Federal share).&nbsp; State agency officials generally concurred with the recommendations, except for separate reporting
  of administrative costs by waiver program.</p>
