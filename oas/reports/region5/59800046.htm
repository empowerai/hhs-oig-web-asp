<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Medicare pays health maintenance organizations (HMOs) a higher capitation rate 
  for beneficiaries who are institutionalized. This final report points out that 
  HMOs received Medicare overpayments estimated at $22.2 million for beneficiaries 
  incorrectly classified as institutionalized. The overpayments resulted from 
  inadequate HMO internal controls in two areas: 1) verification of beneficiaries' 
  institutional status, and 2) reporting of institutional beneficiaries to HCFA. 
  We recommended that HCFA strengthen its on-site review procedures to better 
  identify HMOs that are unable to accurately verify and report the institutional 
  status of enrolled beneficiaries. We also recommended that HCFA take action 
  to recover Medicare overpayments which we estimate to total approximately $22.2 
  million. The HCFA officials concurred with our findings and recommendations.
