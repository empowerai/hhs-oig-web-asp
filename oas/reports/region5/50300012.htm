<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Medicaid credit balances 
  recorded in Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital’s accounting records for inpatient 
  and outpatient services represented overpayments reportable to the Medicaid 
  program.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that Medicaid overpayments of $20,601 were 
  not reported in a timely manner.&nbsp; During our fieldwork, the Medicaid program 
  recovered $13,776 of the overpayments.&nbsp; We recommended that Froedtert Memorial 
  Lutheran Hospital:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;ensure Medicaid overpayments of $20,601 are 
  recovered by the program; and (2)&nbsp;revise policies and procedures to ensure 
  that existing and future overpayments are identified and reported.&nbsp; Froedtert 
  concurred with the results of our review and has already initiated corrective 
  actions with regards to the recommendations.&nbsp; We agree with the corrective 
  actions.</p>
