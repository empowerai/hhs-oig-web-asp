<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that Michigan has an opportunity to increase enrollment in the State Children&#8217;s
  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and have noncustodial parents pay a portion of the associated costs.&nbsp; Based on a
  statistical sample, we estimated that 96,948 Title IV-D children would have been eligible to receive SCHIP benefits during
  the period May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002.&nbsp; The noncustodial parents of 22,722 of these children could have contributed
  $9.8 million toward the $22.5 million in costs that would have been incurred if the children had been enrolled.&nbsp; For
  those children already enrolled, we determined that 2,176 received SCHIP managed care benefits and 413 of these children
  had noncustodial parents who could have contributed $168,345 toward the $289,188 in SCHIP premiums paid on behalf of their
  children.&nbsp; We recommended that Michigan take steps to recover SCHIP premiums from noncustodial parents with medical
  support orders and the ability to pay for their dependent children.</p>
