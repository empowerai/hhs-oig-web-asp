<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Since April 1, 2002 the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has awarded $623 million to 59 State, territorial,
  and selected municipal offices of public health to upgrade the preparedness of the Nation's hospitals and collaborating
  entities to respond to bioterrorism.&nbsp; We reviewed bioterrorism grant programs in 14 States and 4 major metropolitan
  areas.&nbsp; We found that improvements are needed to ensure that bioterrorism program funds are efficiently and effectively
  utilized.&nbsp; We recommended that HRSA:&nbsp; (1) identify awardees not meeting budget restrictions and ensure that all
  awardees account for funds in accordance with their cooperative agreements, (2) provide guidance to awardees on monitoring
  subrecipient expenditures and measuring subrecipient performance, including emphasizing the need for awardees to make site
  visits to directly review subrecipients' expenditures and assess subrecipients' progress in improving bioterrorism preparedness,
  and (3) identify the reason for large unobligated balances and assist the awardees in overcoming barriers to a more timely
  use of funds.&nbsp; HRSA officials concurred with our recommendations.</p>
