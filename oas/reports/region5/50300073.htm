<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of the review was to determine the amount of Medicaid overpayments resulting from payments to providers
  for medical services provided after the recipients&#8217; death.&nbsp; We found that for the period October 1, 1998 through
  September 30, 2001, the Arizona State agency identified and adjusted payments for medical services provided after death.&nbsp; We
  concluded that the State agency had procedures in place to ensure that payments for services provided after the death of
  a recipient were recovered.</p>
