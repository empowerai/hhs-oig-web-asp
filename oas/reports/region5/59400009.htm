<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report notes that the Administration on Aging (AoA) and the Administration 
  for Children and Families (ACF) could take advantage of many benefits offered 
  by intergenerational activities by encouraging the co-location of programs, 
  such as Head Start and senior centers, on a voluntary basis. We are recommending 
  that AoA and ACF examine whether the demonstrated successes in co-locating programs 
  and facilities in the private and public sector can be more broadly applied 
  on a voluntary basis. The AoA and ACF generally agreed with our report and its 
  conclusions and recommendations. </p>
