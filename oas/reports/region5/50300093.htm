<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to ensure that the mandatory
    denial of payment remedy for substandard quality of care was applied to nursing homes that were not in substantial compliance
    with the prescribed Medicaid participation requirements and to evaluate whether State controls were adequate to prevent
    improper Medicaid payments to nursing homes under the denial of payment remedy.&nbsp; Our audit included denial of payment
    sanctions, which were in effect from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2001.&nbsp; The Indiana Family and Social Services
    Administration (State agency) correctly applied the mandatory denial of payment remedy to all nursing homes providing
    substandard quality of care and meeting the criteria for mandatory denial of payment.&nbsp; We found that State controls
    were adequate to prevent improper Medicaid payments to sanctioned nursing homes, as required in Title XIX, section 1919
    of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR § 488.&nbsp; The State agency applies the denial of payment remedy through a &#8220;pay
and chase&#8221; system of identifying and recovering Medicaid overpayments to nursing homes that are under sanction. </p>
