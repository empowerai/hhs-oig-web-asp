<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The objectives of our review were to (1) determine whether 
Urology Tyler (the Practice) claimed reimbursement for pathology laboratory 
services in accordance with Medicare Part B medical necessity and documentation 
requirements from May through December 2004 and (2) analyze the Practice’s 
utilization patterns for pathology services.&nbsp; The Practice’s claims for 
pathology laboratory services generally complied with Medicare Part B medical 
necessity and documentation requirements.&nbsp; We identified one exception that was 
improperly billed and paid due to a clerical error, which was corrected during 
our audit.&nbsp; We noted an increase in the number of prostate-related pathology 
services requested and performed after the Practice opened its own laboratory.&nbsp; 
In addition, the Medicare carrier reimbursed the Practice for more units per 
claim, on average, than it reimbursed other providers for the same pathology 
service.&nbsp; This report contains no recommendations.</p>
