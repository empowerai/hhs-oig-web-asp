<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our review of the internal 
  control structure over the accounts payable balance for the hospital insurance 
  trust fund at September 30, 1992. We identified problems with the design and 
  implementation of the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) internal 
  control structure and accounting policies used to report hospital insurance 
  accounts payable balances. The HCFA's financial reporting instructions to the 
  fiscal intermediaries were too general causing accounts payable amounts to be 
  calculated and reported inconsistently. Also, peer review organization adjustments 
  were not included in the accounts payable balance, and certain benefit payment 
  checks and contracted services were improperly included in the accounts payable 
  balance. Recommendations provide for steps HCFA can take to help ensure the 
  accuracy and reliability of account payable balances. </p>
