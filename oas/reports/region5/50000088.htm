<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final letter report presents the results of our Audit of Medicaid Payments 
  for Oxygen Related Durable Medical Equipment and Supplies.&nbsp; We found that 
  Medicaid providers in Ohio generally received reimbursements for oxygen related 
  items of durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies at rates that were lower 
  than the Medicare allowable amount.&nbsp; Payments were generally acceptable.&nbsp; 
  During our audit period of January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, payments 
  charged to the Medicaid program, which exceeded Medicare payment levels, amounted 
  to only $1,711.&nbsp; We are not recommending recovery but are recommending 
  that the State assure that the maximum allowable price for DME and supplies 
  be limited to an amount equal to or less than the Medicare allowable amount 
  for the same items.</p>
