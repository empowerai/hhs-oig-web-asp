<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>



<p>Our objectives were to (1) consolidate the results of four 
prior State Medicaid agency reports on hospital patient transfers billed as 
discharges and (2) review Medicaid reimbursement policies for unaudited States 
and the District of Columbia to determine whether overpayments could occur if 
transfers were incorrectly coded as discharges.&nbsp; North Carolina, Illinois, New 
York, and Indiana all have Medicaid payment provisions similar to the Medicare 
prospective payment system and our audits of those States identified 
overpayments of approximately $6.4 million ($3.6 million Federal share) for 
hospital patient transfers incorrectly reported as discharges and additional 
potential overpayments of $3.7 million ($1.9 million Federal share).&nbsp; We 
evaluated other Medicaid State plans to identify States that prospectively pay 
for inpatient services and limit payment for transfers.&nbsp;</p> 

<p>We recommended that CMS:&nbsp; (1) monitor the recovery of identified and 
potential overpayments described in our 4 State-specific reports and (2) 
encourage the 25 States and the District of Columbia to consider performing 
focused postpayment assessments of hospital discharges and to recover 
overpayments for transfers inappropriately billed as discharges.&nbsp; CMS agreed 
with our recommendations.</p>
