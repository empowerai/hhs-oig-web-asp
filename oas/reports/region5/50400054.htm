<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The audit objective was to determine if claims for contracted services provided under the child support
  enforcement program were allowable.&nbsp; We identified contracting deficiencies and overcharges related
  to the improper allocation of Domestic Relations Court costs, unallowable charges for serving warrants,
  and improper allocation of claims for security services.&nbsp; We recommended that&nbsp;the State agency
  refund the Federal share of the unallocable and unallowable portion of the Domestic Relations Court
  contract charges of $26,320; review the Domestic Relations Court contracts and identify additional
  overpayments during the months not specifically reviewed; refund the Federal share of $326,969 for
  unallowable payments to serve warrants; and refund the Federal share of unallocable county building
  security costs totaling $206,960.</p>
