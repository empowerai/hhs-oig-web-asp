<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to evaluate whether nine selected skilled nursing facilities in Ohio accurately
  reported the long-term status of institutionalized beneficiaries to ensure proper Medicare
  payments to the managed care organizations.&nbsp; The nine selected Ohio skilled nursing
  facilities followed Federal regulations (42 CFR 483.20(b)(1)) and accurately and completely
  reported assessment information for long-term care facility residents the State specified
  reporting document or Resident Assessment Instrument.&nbsp; Minimum Data Set assessments
  of one hundred beneficiaries in a six-month period included discharges and re-entry assessments
  in compliance with the 14-day rule.&nbsp; We confirmed that the correct determinations of
  resident institutional status were made.&nbsp; As a result, the referring managed care organizations
  received the correct institutional payment for all one hundred beneficiaries reviewed.&nbsp; Therefore,
  no recommendations were warranted.</p>
