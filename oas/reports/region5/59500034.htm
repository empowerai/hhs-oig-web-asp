<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The primary purpose of our audit was to determine whether the Medicare Part 
  A administrative costs claimed, totaling $50,528,129 was reasonable, allowable 
  and allocable in accordance with Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 
  as interpreted and modified by the terms and conditions of the Medicare contract 
  and its Appendices. Of the costs claimed of $50,528,129, we consider $50,111,605 
  to be acceptable and recommend $416,524 for financial adjustment. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  Costs recommended for financial adjustment pertain to understated complementary 
  insurance credits. The Medicare contract and Medicare Intermediary Manual require 
  that complementary insurance credits be determined through a cost allocation 
  method and do not allow a standard charge methodology for insurers that routinely 
  request Medicare claims information. From fiscal year 1986 through our audit 
  period, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisconsin (BCBSUW) has credited 
  the Medicare program using a standard charge of $.35 for each Medicare claim 
  transferred to its complementary insurance program. Officials of BCBSUW could 
  not provide cost allocation documentation supporting the initial rate calculation 
  of $.35 or to show the rate remains applicable during the current audit period.
