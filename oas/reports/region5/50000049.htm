<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit was performed jointly with the Office of Inspector General of the 
  Illinois Department of Public Aid and the Illinois Division of Medical Programs 
  as part of the Inspector General&#146;s partnership efforts with States to expand 
  audit coverage of the Medicaid program. This final report points out that hospitals 
  claimed excessive Medicaid reimbursements by coding transfers to other prospective 
  payment hospitals as discharges (discharges usually qualify for higher reimbursement). 
  We estimate potential improper payments of approximately $2.3 million ($1.2 
  million Federal share) during the period July 1996 through February 2000. In 
  addition to financial adjustments, we recommended that the State agency provide 
  additional guidance to hospitals, emphasizing the importance of coding the correct 
  patient status at the time of discharge/transfer. We also recommended that the 
  State review the potential for effective controls in its claims processing system 
  to detect, monitor, and correct inpatient hospital claims improperly coded as 
  discharges.</p>
