<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of the audit was to determine whether the Ohio Department of Job and Family
  Services (State agency) properly claimed Federal Medicaid funding at the enhanced rate for
  skilled professional medical personnel and their supporting staff for the period October
  1, 2002, through September 30, 2003.&nbsp; The State agency improperly claimed enhanced reimbursement
  for skilled professional medical personnel costs and was overpaid $120,464 in Federal funds.&nbsp; These
  improper costs included (1) salaries and fringe benefits for 22 personnel lacking professional
  education and training, (2) training and travel related to ineligible personnel, and (3)
  accounting costs not eligible for enhanced reimbursement.&nbsp; Because of an accounting
  error in the State agency’s second-quarter claim for Federal reimbursement, the Federal share
  was overstated by an additional $22,500.&nbsp; The State also claimed salary and fringe benefits
  for 138 individuals at the enhanced rate.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency:&nbsp; refund $142,964 for the overpayments and accounting
  error; work with CMS officials to establish the appropriate portion of the $893,281 in enhanced
  funding that is associated with skilled professional medical personnel; implement procedures
  to ensure that future claims include only qualified costs; and identify and refund the Federal
  share of Medicaid overpayments for skilled professional medical personnel claimed after September
  30, 2003.&nbsp; In a written response, Ohio officials disagreed with the recommended refund
  of salary costs.&nbsp; Based on the comments, we revised our recommendations to set aside
  $893,281 for CMS to adjudicate.</p>
