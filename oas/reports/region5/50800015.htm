<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">In a follow-up audit of 
Kentucky’s Medicaid drug rebate program, we found that the State had 
implemented, as of June 30, 2006, the recommendations from our prior audit.&nbsp; 
Under the drug rebate program, manufacturers receive Federal Medicaid funding 
for covered outpatient drugs by entering into a rebate agreement with CMS and 
paying quarterly rebates to the States. &nbsp;The State had implemented our 
recommendations <span style="font-size: 11.5pt">related to verifying rebate 
amounts reported on the Form CMS-64.9R, reconciling accounts receivable amounts 
to subsidiary records, and collecting older outstanding drug rebates. 
Additionally, the State had established controls over collecting rebates on 
single-source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; Therefore, this report offered 
no recommendations.</span></p>
