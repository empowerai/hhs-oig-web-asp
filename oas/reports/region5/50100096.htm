<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review 
  was to determine if payments to Inter Valley Health Plan (Contract H0545) were 
  appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; The final 
  report points out that Inter Valley received Medicare overpayments totaling 
  $319,355 for 27 beneficiaries incorrectly reported as institutionalized during 
  the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; Twenty-six of the 
  identified beneficiaries were residents of domiciliary facilities that did not 
  qualify a beneficiary for institutional status.&nbsp; Inter Valley should not 
  have received payment at the enhanced institutional rate.
