<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>OIG determined the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled
    Nursing Facility (SNF) payments made under the administrative responsibility of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona,
    Inc.&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated that $1.7 million of ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative
    responsibility of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona, Inc. during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments
    occurred because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
    Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient
    hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.</p>
