<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives of this report were to determine (1) how much revenue three large
  group purchasing organizations (GPOs) received from vendors and what the disposition of that revenue
  was, (2) how members treated distributions of net administrative fee revenue received from GPOs on
  their Medicare cost reports, and (3) whether members properly recorded rebates received from vendors
  on their Medicare cost reports.&nbsp; The three large GPOs that we reviewed collected administrative
  fee revenue of $513 million.&nbsp; Of this amount, $275 million represented net revenue in excess of
  operating costs.&nbsp; The GPOs retained $58 million of the $275 million in net revenue to provide
  reserves and venture capital for new business lines.&nbsp; They distributed the remaining $217 million
  to members.&nbsp; We reviewed how seven healthcare systems, representing several hundred GPO members,
  accounted for the net revenue distributed by the three GPOs.&nbsp; We found that $5 million of net
  revenue distributions and $1.6 million of rebates were not credited on Medicare cost reports.&nbsp; We
  believe that clarification of instructions from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to hospitals
  is needed and that recommendations in our prior report on three GPOs (A-05-03-00074) are timely and
  valid.</p>
