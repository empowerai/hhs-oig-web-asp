<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Contrary to Federal requirements, Illinois did not 
contribute an estimated $2.1 million to CMS on behalf of the State’s 
“full-duals” from January through October 2006.&nbsp; Full-duals are beneficiaries 
who are eligible for both full Medicaid benefits and Medicare.&nbsp; Although 
Medicare subsidizes the Part D prescription drug benefit for full-duals, each 
State is required to make contributions.<br>
<br>
The State made no contributions for 22 of the 300 sampled full-dual 
beneficiary-months.&nbsp; Although the State’s monthly Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) file included full-dual information for 
18 of the 22 beneficiary-months, CMS did not include the information in the MMA 
return file that identifies the amount billed to the State.&nbsp; For the remaining 
four beneficiary-months, the State did not include full-dual information in its 
MMA file, nor did CMS in its MMA return file. &nbsp;We recommended that the State (1) 
work with CMS to develop a process for reconciling the MMA file to the MMA 
return file to ensure that required contributions are identified and made for 
all full-duals and (2) identify and accurately report all full-duals to CMS in 
the MMA file.&nbsp; The State concurred with the recommendations.</p>
