<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This report presents 
  the results of our Review of Medicaid Payment Amounts for Oxygen Related Durable 
  Medical Equipment and Supplies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
  determined that providers received reimbursements for these items of durable 
  medical equipment (DME) and supplies at rates that were higher than the Medicare 
  allowable amount.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on our review of payments for Medicaid 
  DME and supply claims with dates of service during the period October 1, 1997 
  through June 30, 2000, savings of approximately $685,500 could have been realized 
  if the Medicaid rates had been limited to amounts allowable under the Medicare 
  program. This annual savings of approximately $250,000 would result in a cost 
  savings of approximately $1,250,000 over a five-year budget cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The higher reimbursements occurred because the State agency set the reimbursement 
  limits for these items above the dollar amount allowed for similar items under 
  the Medicare program.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are recommending that the State limit 
  the maximum allowable price for DME and supplies to an amount equal to or less 
  than the Medicare allowable amount for the same items.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
