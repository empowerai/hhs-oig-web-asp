<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 
<p>OIG evaluated whether the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (Agency) had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the State's Medicaid drug rebate Program.&nbsp; We determined that the Agency could improve
  its policies regarding the collection of drug rebate interest for unpaid, late, and disputed drug rebates, and the use
  of a hearing mechanism to resolve drug rebate disputes with the manufacturers. We recommended that the Agency develop formal
  policies, procedures, and controls to follow-up and collect interest for unpaid, late, or disputed drug rebate payments,
  and monitor disputed rebate amounts, including appropriate use of the hearing mechanism prescribed in the rebate agreement
  between CMS and the manufacturers.&nbsp; The Agency believes it is in compliance.&nbsp; We continue to believe our recommended
  action is necessary.</p>
