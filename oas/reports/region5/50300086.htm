<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments
  contained in our database of payments made under the administrative responsibility of Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield.&nbsp; We
  estimated that $1.1 million of ineligible SNF payments were made during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments
  occurred because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Common
  Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient
  hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.</p>
