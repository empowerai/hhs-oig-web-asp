<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides 
  the results of our audit made to determine whether Medicare payments to Health 
  Net (Contract H0351) were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; 
  We determined that Health Net received Medicare overpayments totaling $21,233 
  for 53 beneficiaries incorrectly reported as institutionalized during the period 
  January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; The majority of the beneficiaries 
  were residents of domiciliary type facilities that do not qualify a beneficiary 
  for institutional status.&nbsp; Health Net should not have received payment 
  at the enhanced institutional rate.</p>
