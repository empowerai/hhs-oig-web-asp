<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether awardees: recorded, summarized, and reported bioterrorism program
  transactions by focus area in accordance with their cooperative agreements; established procedures to monitor subrecipient
  expenditures; and had unobligated fund balances as of August 30, 2003.&nbsp; We determined that of the 17 audited awardees: &nbsp;fourteen
  recorded, summarized, and reported bioterrorism program funds by focus area; six had developed adequate procedures to monitor
  subrecipient expenditures; and fifteen had unobligated balances of Federal bioterrorism funds as of August 30, 2003 totaling
  approximately $65 million, or 15 percent of the $428 million awarded.&nbsp; We recommended that CDC: (1) continue to emphasize
  the requirement to account for funds by focus area; (2) identify awardees that have not accounted for their funds in accordance
  with the cooperative agreements and ensure that they revise their accounting procedures; (3) provide guidance to awardees
  on monitoring subrecipient expenditures and measuring subrecipient performance, including emphasizing the need for awardees
  to make site visits to directly review subrecipients&#8217; expenditures and assess subrecipients&#8217; progress in improving
  bioterrorism preparedness; and (4) identify the reasons for large unobligated balances and assist the awardees in overcoming
  barriers to a more timely use of funds.&nbsp; In response, the CDC officials agreed with the findings and recommendations.</p>
