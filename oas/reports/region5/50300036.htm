<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare
  Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments contained in our database of payments
  made under the administrative responsibility of First Coast Services Options,
  Inc. (First Coast).&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated that $6.8 million
  of ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility
  of First Coast during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments
  occurred because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary’s
  claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient
  hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; First Coast agreed with
  the findings and recommendations presented in the report and will investigate
  the SNF claims the OIG has determined to be unallowable and initiate recovery
  of the unallowable amount.</p>
