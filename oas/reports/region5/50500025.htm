<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective
    of the audit was to determine whether enrollment in the Detroit Head Start Program was
    in accordance with ACF funding levels.&nbsp; We found that delegates generally met the
    adjusted enrollment levels established by ACF.&nbsp; Federal regulations require that Head
    Start grantees maintain funded enrollment levels and promptly fill vacancies.&nbsp; The
    Detroit Head Start program contracted with seven delegates to provide Head Start services
    to Detroit-area children.&nbsp; Because our review of enrollment records at Detroit Public
    Schools, Hartford and New Saint Paul disclosed no material differences between the funded
and actual enrollment rates, we have no recommendation to report.</p>
