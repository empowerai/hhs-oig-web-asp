<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability 
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process 
  for determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed 
  care organizations (MCO). At a Region V risk-based MCO we identified $1.2 million 
  in administrative costs that would be considered inappropriate and unallowable 
  if considered in light of the Medicare program's general principle of paying 
  only reasonable costs. Examples of the inappropriate costs included bad debt 
  expenses, monies paid to a trade association, and monies used for public relations, 
  donations, contributions, gifts, entertainment, and social functions for customers 
  and employees. The methodology which allows MCOs to apportion administrative 
  costs to Medicare is flawed and results in Medicare covering a disproportionate 
  amount of the MCO's administrative costs. Additional reviews of the ACR process, 
  currently ongoing, disclose similar problems at other MCOs. The results of these 
  reviews are being shared with the Health Care Health Financing Administration 
  so that appropriate legislative changes can be considered. </p>
