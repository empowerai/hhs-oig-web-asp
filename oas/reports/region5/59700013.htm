<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if capitation payments to PacifiCare of California were appropriate for beneficiaries
  reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined PacifiCare received Medicare overpayments totaling $9,700 for 14 beneficiaries
  incorrectly classified as institutionalized.&nbsp; The 14 beneficiaries were part of a statistical sample of 100 Medicare
  beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1996.&nbsp; Based on
  our sample results, we estimate that PacifiCare received Medicare overpayments of at least $398,084 for beneficiaries incorrectly
  classified as institutionalized during the audit period.</span></p>
