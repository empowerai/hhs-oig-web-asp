<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>We estimate the State claimed $77,000 ($39,000 Federal share) during State 
fiscal year (SFY) 2005 for 
Medicaid reimbursement paid to Sequin Services, Inc. (Seguin) for home and community-based 
services (HCBS) 
that did not comply with Federal and State requirements because Seguin did not 
provide the services or meet documentation requirements, or the services were 
unallowable.&nbsp; Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act authorizes the HCBS 
waiver program.&nbsp; A State’s HCBS waiver program must be approved by CMS and 
allows the State to claim Federal reimbursement for services not usually covered 
by Medicaid.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that the State refund $39,000 to the Federal Government for unallowable HCBS claimed in SFY 2005 and require Seguin to implement internal controls to 
ensure it documents and claims reimbursement only for allowable HCBS actually 
provided.&nbsp; The State did not address our first recommendation, indicated 
that Seguin revised its daily day program attendance record, and stated that 
Seguin no longer bills for time during the regular day program hours when day 
program staff take participants to a doctor’s appointment.</span></p>
