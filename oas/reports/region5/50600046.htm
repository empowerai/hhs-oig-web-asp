<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="CM26" style="margin-right:8.65pt;line-height:13.9pt">Our objectives 
were to (1) determine whether universities and colleges limited the graduate 
student compensation charged to <span style="font-size:11.5pt;color:black">
National Institutes of Health (</span>NIH) research grants to the amount paid to 
a first-year, postdoctoral scientist performing comparable work at the same 
institution and to the National Research Service Award stipend in effect when 
NIH awarded the grants and (2) <span style="font-size:11.5pt">provide 
statistical estimates of the number of grants with graduate student compensation 
costs charged; the number of researchers who received graduate student 
compensation, including tuition remission, from NIH grants; and the costs of 
such compensation. </span></p>
<p class="CM26" style="margin-right:8.65pt;line-height:13.9pt">For all sampled grants with graduate student compensation 
charges, we found that universities and colleges appropriately limited graduate 
student compensation charges to the amount paid to a first-year, postdoctoral 
scientist performing comparable work at the same institution and to the National 
Research Service Award stipend in effect when NIH awarded the grants.&nbsp; This 
report also provides statistical estimates related to graduate student 
compensation costs charged to NIH grants.&nbsp; The report contains no 
recommendations.</p>
<p class="CM26" style="line-height: 13.9pt; margin-right: 8.65pt">We will provide the report to the two Members of Congress 
who requested the review.&nbsp;</p>
