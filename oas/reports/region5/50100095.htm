<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review 
  was to determine if payments to Humana (Contract H0307) were appropriate for 
  beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined that Humana 
  received Medicare overpayments totaling $18,645 for 37 beneficiaries incorrectly 
  reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 through December 
  31, 2000.&nbsp; The 37 beneficiaries include 23 that did not meet the 30-day 
  residency requirement in an institutional facility, five beneficiaries for whom 
  Humana staff could provide no institutional residency information and 9 beneficiaries 
  residing in non-certified facilities.</p>
