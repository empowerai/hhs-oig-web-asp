<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The primary objective of this review was to determine whether survey and certification 
  costs were properly allocated between Medicare, Medicaid, and State licensing 
  programs.&nbsp; We found that, rather than establishing an equitable basis for 
  allocating costs among benefitting programs, the allocation of survey and certification 
  costs was based on predetermined historical percentages. During the budgetary 
  process for each State, the percentages were developed by the Centers for Medicare 
  &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) staff based on their knowledge and expertise of 
  Federal and State program requirements. Since these allocation percentages were 
  established years ago, there was no supporting documentation to substantiate 
  these percentages.&nbsp; We recommended that CMS consider requiring States to 
  develop and implement a system which will provide assurances that survey and 
  certification costs are equitably allocated among benefiting programs.</p>
