<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This audit was performed jointly with the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts 
  under the Office of Inspector General’s Partnership Plan. The objective of the 
  review was to determine if the State agency was reimbursing Medicaid providers 
  in excess of the State Medicare limits for durable medical equipment (DME) and 
  supplies used to provide oxygen. We determined that, for the three-year audit 
  period ending December 31, 2000, the Medicaid program was overcharged $727,000 
  (federal share $511,397) for excessive reimbursements to providers of oxygen 
  related DME and supplies.&nbsp; We recommended that the State refund $511,397 
  and up date the payment limits for oxygen related DME and supplies on a timely 
  basis.</p>
