<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Dental Health Professions 
  Student Loans (HPSL) Program at the University of Detroit Mercy. The HPSL program 
  was implemented through the Public Health Service Act. The Health Resources 
  and Services Administration (HRSA) has overall management responsibilities for 
  the program at the Federal level. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We determined that the University was generally in compliance with regulations 
  concerning the administration of loans. However, our audit revealed that the 
  University was carrying uncollectible loans in their accounting records. </p>
