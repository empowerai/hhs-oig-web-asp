<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report, prepared by Sheffield, Dallmann and Haley, Ltd., under 
  contract with the Office of Inspector General, provides the results of an audit 
  of Medicare Part A and Part B administrative costs totaling approximately $67.4 
  million claimed by Associated Insurance Companies, Inc. (contractor) for Fiscal 
  Years ended September 30, 1987 through 1989. The report points out that about 
  $3.8 million of the claimed costs were unallowable. Also, the auditors point 
  out that the contractor failed to claim about $0.4 million to which it was entitled. 
  The auditors recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements to 
  correct the weaknesses noted. </p>
