<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report summarizes the results of recent audits conducted to 
  determine compliance with Federal law and regulations applicable to institutions 
  for mental diseases (IMD). The Social Security Act generally precludes Federal 
  financial participation in the cost of care and treatment provided to individuals 
  in IMDs who are between 22 and 64 years of age. Our reviews in several States 
  identified unallowable Medicaid payments totaling over $33 million (Federal 
  share). Partly as a result of these audits, regional offices of the Health Care 
  Financing Administration identified and recovered an additional $40 million 
  from the States. We estimate that the Federal Government will realize annual 
  cost savings under the Medicaid program of $35 million. </p>
