<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p></strong>
<p>The objective of 
  this partnership review with the Inspector General, Illinois Department of Public 
  Aid (IDPA) was to develop and validate a time dependent billing routine that 
  would identify practitioners who submitted claims for more time than is feasible 
  in a day.&nbsp; The routine identified practitioners who billed for one or more 
  12-hour days for dates of service from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2000.&nbsp; 
  Two organizations were identified as alternate payees for several physicians 
  in the time dependent billing project.&nbsp; The alternate payees claimed physician 
  psychotherapy services and received payments on behalf of the physicians.&nbsp; 
  We concluded that the physicians did not provide the psychotherapy services 
  claimed by the alternate payees.&nbsp; Counselors employed by the alternate 
  payees allegedly provided family counseling services, which were claimed, using 
  the physicians' Medicaid provider number, as individual psychotherapy services 
  provided by physicians.&nbsp; None of the services billed by the two alternate 
  payees, during the audit period, were performed by physicians; therefore, we 
  recommended that IDPA recover the unallowable payments made to the two alternate 
  payees totaling $7,581,693 (Federal share ($3,790,846).&nbsp; The State agency 
  concurred with our findings and recommendation. </p>
