<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that of 224 beneficiaries who had been in 
  hospice care at Samaritan Care, Inc. for more than 210 days, 213 beneficiaries 
  were not eligible for hospice coverage. As a result, Medicare overpayments to 
  Samaritan for these beneficiaries amounted to more than $10.4 million. The beneficiaries 
  were ineligible because medical determinations, made by physicians under contract 
  to the Illinois Medicare peer review organization found the medical evidence 
  in the files showed that the beneficiaries did not have terminal conditions 
  resulting in life expectancies of 6 months of less. Because of pending criminal 
  and civil actions against the previous owner of Samaritan, we are not making 
  a recommendation for the Health Care Financing Administration to independently 
  recoup the $10.4 million in identified overpayments. We are, however, recommending 
  improved controls to help preclude abusive practices. </p>
