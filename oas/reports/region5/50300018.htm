<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The report provides summary results of audits completed in 9 States and additional analyses in 41other
  States of paid claims for oxygen related durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies.&nbsp; The audits were made to determine
  whether State Medicaid programs reimbursed providers in excess of Medicare payment limits for DME and supplies used to
  provide oxygen.&nbsp; We found that Medicaid paid providers in 6 of the 9 States approximately $12.7 million (Federal share
  $7.3 million) more than Medicare would have paid.&nbsp; Further, our analyses in the other 41 States demonstrated that
  significant additional savings are possible.&nbsp; We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
  instruct those State agencies that limit Medicaid rates to Medicare reimbursement levels to apply Medicaid payment limits
  for oxygen-related DME and supplies correctly and in a timely manner, and alert the remaining State agencies to the opportunity
  to reduce Medicaid payments by limiting reimbursement rates for oxygen-related DME and supplies to the Medicare allowable
  amounts.</p>
