<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine how much funding remained unobligated at the close of the Bioterrorism Program and what factors contributed to the unobligated balances.&nbsp;At the close of the Bioterrorism Program, unobligated balances totaled more than $157 million for the 52 awardees that submitted financial status reports for the last budget period.&nbsp;This amount represented 15.8 percent of the approximately $996 million awarded for the last budget period.&nbsp;Although CDC had methods in place to monitor the obligation and expenditure of funds, many awardees did not fully execute their expenditure plans or submit timely financial status reports.&nbsp;Thus, CDC did not always receive the information needed to encourage the expenditure of funds and to minimize unobligated balances.&nbsp;CDC officials did not offset (reduce) new-year awards by the amount of unobligated funds carried over from the prior budget year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under its new program, which began August 31, 2005, CDC has strengthened its guidance and established additional controls.&nbsp;CDC also reports that it has obtained departmental approval to use carryover funds from the prior budget year to offset the amount of funding approved for the new budget period.</p>
<p>We recommended that CDC, in managing awards under its new program: (1) ensure that awardees submit financial status reports in a timely manner, (2) follow new program guidance to better manage grant funds among eligible entities and preparedness priorities, and (3) when appropriate, offset new-year awards by the amount of unobligated funds carried over from the prior budget year to better manage large unobligated balances and meet program goals.&nbsp;CDC concurred with our recommendations and stated that it had taken a number of actions that had helped to significantly reduce unobligated balances.</p>
