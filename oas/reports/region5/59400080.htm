<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out unallowable costs of about $4 million claimed 
  by Associated Insurance Companies, Inc. for Fiscal Years 1990 through 1993. 
  The unallowable costs consisted of, and we recommended financial adjustments 
  for: $2.4 million for credits due the Medicare program; $0.5 million for executive 
  salary increases which exceeded the average increases for comparable positions, 
  as measured by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics; $0.3 million for unfunded 
  pension costs; $0.2 million for professional consultant services unrelated to 
  Medicare; $0.2 million for indirect costs that were for non-Medicare related 
  activities; and $0.4 million for various items which were unsupported, not in 
  accordance with Federal regulations, or did not benefit the Medicare program.
