<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report disclosed that Medicare accounts receivable credit balances 
  included overpayments totaling an estimated $8.6 million in the State of Michigan. 
  The estimated overpayments were associated with 56 hospitals in Michigan serviced 
  by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) as the medicare fiscal intermediary. 
  The overpayments existed because both the hospitals and BCBSM did not review 
  credit balances and process adjustments timely. We are recommending recovery 
  of the overpayments and procedural improvements to ensure that the hospitals 
  and BCBSM perform more timely reviews. </p>
