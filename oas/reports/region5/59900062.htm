<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that Americare Physical Therapy and Rehab Services 
  (Americare) claimed payment for outpatient rehabilitation services that did 
  not meet the Medicare criteria for reimbursement. Specifically, we identified 
  charges for outpatient rehabilitation services that were not reasonable and 
  medically necessary for the beneficiary's condition, or were inadequately documented. 
  Based on a statistical sample, we estimate that at least $190,399 was paid to 
  Americare for unallowable charges. We also identified additional unallowable 
  costs of $313,220 in unreasonable owner's compensation, contracted costs for 
  which there was not sufficient documentation, and other miscellaneous unallowable 
  expenses on Americare's 1997 Medicare cost report. Americare concurred with 
  our recommendation that it strengthen its procedures to ensure that claims for 
  services are reasonable, necessary, and properly documented and that nonreimbursable 
  costs are eliminated from its Medicare cost reports. We are also providing the 
  results of our audit to the fiscal intermediary so that it can make the appropriate 
  financial adjustments. </p>
