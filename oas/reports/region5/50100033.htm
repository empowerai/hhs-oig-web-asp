<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective of this review was to determine the amount and collectibility 
  of non-tax delinquent debt that was owed to Medicare and reported by the Centers 
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Region V Regional Office (RO), as 
  of September 30, 2000.&nbsp; Although we believe that the RO has reported and 
  properly accounted for their outstanding accounts receivable and delinquent 
  balances without any material misstatements, our review did disclose a net overstatement 
  of $410,917 in the non-Medicare secondary payer (MSP) principle balance reported 
  by the RO, attributable to problems detected in our reconciliation of the RO 
  financial reports and the review of the sampled items. The discrepancies included 
  improper location codes on the Provider Overpayment Report (POR) and the Physician 
  Supplier Overpayment Report (PSOR), inaccuracies between account balances on 
  the R751 and the POR or PSOR, duplicate amounts, and unrecognized collections. 
  We also found that 44 percent of the sampled non-MSP receivables had inaccuracies 
  in their outstanding principal balances and noted problems with the due diligence 
  exercised by the RO in its collection efforts for 26 percent of the 34 receivables 
  reviewed.</p>
