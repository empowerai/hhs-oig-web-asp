<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<h2>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight: normal">
The objective of our review was to determine whether the Illinois Department of 
Healthcare and Family Services (the State agency) made 
payments on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been Medicaid-eligible 
due to their eligibility in Indiana.&nbsp; For the period July 1, 2005, through June 
30, 2006, we estimate that the State agency paid $408,841 ($204,420 Federal 
share) for Medicaid services provided to beneficiaries who should not have been 
eligible due to their Medicaid eligibility in Indiana.&nbsp; The Medicaid payments 
were made on behalf of these beneficiaries because the State agency and 
Indiana’s Medicaid agency did not share all available Medicaid eligibility 
information.&nbsp; </span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency work with the Indiana 
Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid eligibility information for use in 
(1) determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status and (2) reducing the 
amount of payments, estimated to be $408,841 ($204,420 Federal share), made on 
behalf of beneficiaries residing in Indiana.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with the 
recommendations.</p>
