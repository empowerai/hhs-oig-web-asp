<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report found that States are not adequately monitoring Medicaid 
  overpayments to providers. We found that 19 State agencies do not have any method 
  to identify Medicaid credit balances and recover overpayments. We recommended 
  that HCFA establish a national Medicaid credit balance reporting mechanism similar 
  to the Medicare Part A credit balance reporting procedures. The HCFA should 
  consider modifying the Medicare procedures to make them viable for the Medicaid 
  program. Further, HCFA should allow individual States the option of an exemption 
  from or adjustment to the basic reporting system. We also recommended that HCFA 
  regional offices actively monitor the national Medicaid credit balance reporting 
  mechanism. The HCFA agreed with our recommendations. </p>
