<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that Medicaid providers received reimbursements
  for oxygen related items of durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies at
  rates that were higher than the Medicare allowable amount.&nbsp; The higher
  reimbursements occurred because the State agency did not reflect Medicare reductions
  in the Medicaid reimbursement limits set for these items.&nbsp; Based on our
  review of payments for Medicaid DME and supply claims with dates of service
  during our audit period of January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, we found
  that savings of approximately $2 million (Federal share $1 million) could have
  been realized if the Medicaid rates had been limited to amounts allowable under
  the Medicare program.&nbsp; We have recommended that the State limit the maximum
  allowable price for DME and supplies to an amount equal to or less than the
  Medicare allowable amount for the same items.</p>
