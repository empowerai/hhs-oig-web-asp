<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of this report was to consolidate and present issues disclosed 
  by our ongoing Project Operation Restore Trust (ORT) audits of Medicare hospice 
  services. Some of the hospices which we have audited and referred to in this 
  report are also the subject of continuing Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
  review. </p>
<p>The Medicare hospice program, while highly respected and successful in its 
  mission, is a program which has experienced a substantial number of ineligible 
  enrollments as identified in our audits. The reviews focused on determining 
  whether the beneficiaries met the Medicare definition of &#147;terminally ill&#148; 
  at the time of enrollment in the hospice program. The audits covered 12 large 
  hospices located in 4 ORT States (Illinois, Florida, Texas, and California). 
  Working with us, physicians from Medicare Peer Review Organizations (PRO's) 
  reviewed the medical files of all 2,109 long-term beneficiaries in those hospices 
  that had been in care over 210 days, or that had been discharged from hospice 
  at some point after reaching the 210 day threshold. The PRO physicians concluded 
  that 1,373 of the selected beneficiaries were ineligible for hospice because, 
  at the time of initial diagnosis, they were not terminally ill as defined by 
  Medicare regulations, i.e,. having a life expectancy of 6 months or less (we 
  hereinafer use the phrase &quot;terminally ill&quot; as defined in Medicare 
  regulations). To date, we have issued 5 individual reports to the Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) recommending that the Regional Home Health Intermediaries 
  (RHHI) recover about $17.2 million for ineligible payments made to these hospices. 
  The remaining seven hospices are pending further OIG review of their activities. 
  Combining the findings on all 12 hospices, Medicare paid about $83 million on 
  behalf of the 1,373 ineligible beneficiaries. Payments for some of these beneficiaries 
  could be continuing today. For 262 additional beneficiaries reviewed, eligibility 
  could not be established because medical evidence was missing from patient files 
  or was incomplete. Medicare payments applicable to these 262 patients totaled 
  about $14 million. </p>
<p>Although our audits covered only 12 large hospices and were focused only on 
  long-term patients, analysis of the HCFA data base for hospice beneficiaries 
  showed evidence of numerous long-term beneficiaries in other hospices across 
  the country. Significant growth in the number of long-term patients admitted 
  by hospices occured after hospice regulations were modified to add a fourth, 
  indefinite length, period of care for reimbursement purposes. As of February 
  1996, over 11,000 beneficiaries (about 14 percent of hospice beneficiaries nationwide) 
  had been in care for more than 210 days. </p>
<p>These ORT reviews followed a more limited audit of hospices in Puerto Rico 
  which noted large numbers of ineligible beneficiaries. An island-wide statistical 
  sample in Puerto Rico disclosed that about $20 million was paid by Medicare 
  for beneficiaries who were not terminally ill at the time of diagnosis. This 
  amount together with our results at the selected hospices in ORT States brings 
  the total of identified Medicare payments for ineligible recipients to more 
  than $100 million. We recommended to HCFA that it recover about $37.2 for ineligible 
  payments made to these hospices. </p>
<p>We have identified several underlying factors which we believe contributed 
  to the problems we noted in our hospices audits. 
<ul>
  <li>There has been less rigorous enforcement of the 6-month prognosis requirement 
    by the hospice industry, especially for various noncancer diagnosed patients. 
    This softening is most apparent in the enrollment of nursing facility residents 
    that have chronic medical problems common to an elderly population. About 
    60 percent of the 1,373 ineligible beneficiaries identified during our reviews 
    were nursing facility patients. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Hospice regulations applicable to nursing home residents are complex. The 
    regulations prohibit Medicare payments for hospice care on behalf of beneficiaries 
    receiving Medicare funded services in skilled nursing facilities. Paradoxically, 
    Medicare payments for hospice care are permissible when the beneficiary is 
    receiving Medicaid funded services in a nursing facility. The joint funding 
    by the Medicare and Medicaid programs for these nursing home residents open 
    the possibility for abusive practices. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A nationwide chain of hospices paid an amount in excess of the usual Medicaid 
    reimbursement to nursing facilities and used marketing materials which downplayed 
    or ignored the 6-month prognosis requirement. In addition, the chain had a 
    large sales staff which was paid commissions in amounts based on the length 
    of a patient's stay. These practices created a climate conducive to enrollment 
    of hospice patients who were not terminally ill. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Internal controls are weak in the areas of physician certifications of terminal 
    illness, claims processing, and medical review at the RHHI, audit procedures 
    at the RHHIs for &quot;cap&quot; report reviews, and the overall design of 
    the reimbursement &quot;cap&quot; system--the method of paying hospices a 
    maximum amount of Medicare funds based on a census count of beneficiaries 
    enrolled. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the problems noted in this report are longstanding and have been pointed 
  out by others. A recent article in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine </i>concluded 
  that patients in large and for-profit hospices have relatively long survival 
  periods after enrollment and suggested that such hospices may encourage early 
  enrollments to recoup the high up-front costs associated with admissions. Other 
  questions were posed in the article regarding whether such hospices have efficient 
  &quot;outreach&quot; programs or place fewer &quot;barriers to enrollment.&quot; 
  We believe the results of our audits as detailed in this report will help HCFA 
  respond to these questions. Other recently issued OIG reports have highlighted 
  vulnerabilities in the Medicare program for hospice beneficiaries residing in 
  nursing homes. </p>
<p>To date, we have issued 5 individual reports to HCFA recommending that the 
  RHHIs recover $17.2 million for payments made for ineligible beneficiaries. 
  The remaining 7 hospices representing ineligible payments totaling $65.8 million 
  are pending additional OIG review of their activities. In the report, we are 
  making broader recommendations for HCFA to consider that, in our opinion, will 
  prevent various problems or abusive practices we have identified in the hospice 
  program from recurring. Our recommendations include: 
<ul>
  <li>Reinforcing the &quot;6-month prognosis&quot; requirement through a direct 
    bulletin or memorandum from HCFA to industry advocacy groups for dissemination 
    to all hospices. </li>
  <li>Prohibiting the practice of hospices paying nursing facilities more for 
    &quot;room and board&quot; than the hospices receive from the State Medicaid 
    agencies on behalf of dually eligible beneficiaries. </li>
  <li>Informing hospices that marketing materials should prominently feature Medicare 
    eligibility requirements and monitoring the use of sales commissions as incentives 
    for patient recruiting. </li>
  <li>Making hospice physicians more accountable for their certifications of terminal 
    prognosis by requiring that the certification-recertification forms signed 
    by these physicians contain a statement concerning the penalties for false 
    claims. </li>
  <li>Strengthening claims processing controls at the RHHIs with more focus on 
    front-end reviews and nontraditional, suspect, or exceedingly vague diagnoses. 
  </li>
  <li>Seeking legislative change for a more meaningful &quot;cap&quot; or maximum 
    amount for hospice payments and instructing the RHHIs to establish standard 
    audit procedures for these &#147;cap&#148; reports submitted by hospices. 
  </li>
  <li>Proposing legislation to restructure the use of benefit periods so that 
    individuals who do not need or no longer need hospice care could be discharged 
    without prejudice to eligibility during a defined hold harmless period of 
    program adjustments. </li>
  <li>Seeking a legislative amendment to make changes to the existing payment 
    methodology for dually eligible nursing facility residents, by reducing to 
    the lowest level necessary the Medicare hospice payment for these nursing 
    facility patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, enacted after publication of our draft report, 
  resulted in numerous modifications of Medicare's hospice benefit. These modifications 
  included allowing hospices to discharge patients whose conditions improved without 
  loss of future benefits to the hospice beneficiary (which addressed one of the 
  above recommendations) and a new requirement for more frequent certifications 
  of eligibility after 180 days of hospice care. </p>
<p>The HCFA generally concurred with the recommendations in our draft report. 
  They noted, however, that from their readings the art of accurate predictions 
  about terminal prognoses is not exact. Although they do not believe this negates 
  the findings overall (giving recognition to the PROs that reviewed our cases), 
  they noted there could be some degree of inaccuracy in some of the individual 
  cases found ineligible. We appreciate the state of the art, but we have no reason 
  to dispute the medical opinion of the PRO reviewers who determined that 1,373 
  beneficiaries were not terminally ill as defined by HCFA. </p>
<p>We have paraphrased HCFA's response after each recommendation in the Results 
  of Review section of the report and have added our additional comments, where 
  appropriate. </p>
