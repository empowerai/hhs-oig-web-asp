<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</B></P>
<p>The objective of the review was to determine the amount of Medicaid overpayments resulting from providers billing for
  medical services for dates after the beneficiaries&#8217; death.&nbsp; We found that for the period October 1, 1998, through
  September 30, 2001, the Massachusetts Office of Medicaid did not identify all payments for medical services provided after
  death.&nbsp; In a statistical sample of 100 paid claims, we found 52 payments were for services billed for dates after
  the Medicaid beneficiaries&#8217; deaths.&nbsp; The overpayments were not adjusted.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that
  unrecovered overpayments were $1,007,431 (Federal share $503,715).&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency review current
  methods of data matching to ensure deceased Medicaid beneficiaries are identified and overpayments are adjusted.&nbsp; Massachusetts
  officials generally agreed with the recommendations and had initiated corrective actions.</p>
