<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare
  Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments contained in our database of payments
  made under the administrative responsibility of AdminaStar Federal (AdminaStar).&nbsp; Our
  review of the database estimated that $25.3 million of ineligible SNF payments
  were made under the administrative responsibility of AdminaStar during calendar
  years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred because of the absence
  of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services'
  Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary’s claims processing systems,
  verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior
  to SNF admission.&nbsp; AdminaStar agreed with the findings and recommendations
  presented in the report and will adjust all claims paid incorrectly and pursue
  recovery of the dollars associated with the claims.</p>
