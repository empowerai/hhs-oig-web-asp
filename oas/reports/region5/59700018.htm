<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if Medicare payments to Maricopa Health Plan were appropriate for beneficiaries
  reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We found that Medicare payments to Maricopa for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized
  were generally correct.&nbsp; Our results are based on a statistical sample of 100 Medicare beneficiaries reported as institutionalized
  during the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1996.&nbsp; We determined the beneficiaries in our sample were
  correctly reported as institutionalized, with the exception of minor errors.&nbsp; The positive results are attributed
  to Maricopa's procedures for verifying the institutional status of its beneficiaries.</p>
