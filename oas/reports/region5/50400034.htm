<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments,
  attributable to Rhode Island Medicare Services, contained in a database of payments made under the administrative responsibility
  of nine Medicare Fiscal Intermediaries (FI&#8217;s).&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated that $510,163 of ineligible
  SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of Rhode Island Medicare Services during calendar years
  1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred due to the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s (FI) claims processing systems,
  verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; In their response,
  Rhode Island Medicare Services cited a CMS memorandum which instructed all Medicare FIs to suspend recovery efforts related
  to the OIG audit of ineligible SNF payments.</p>
