<hr noshade><strong><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review 
  was to determine if payments to Aetna (Contract H3951) were appropriate for 
  beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined that Aetna 
  received Medicare overpayments totaling $87,516 for 90 beneficiaries incorrectly 
  reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 through December 
  31, 2000.&nbsp; Institutional status requirements specify that a beneficiary 
  must be a resident of a qualifying facility for a minimum of 30 consecutive 
  days immediately prior to the first day of the current reporting month.&nbsp; 
  The 90 beneficiaries included 48 that had admittance or discharge dates during 
  the 30-day residency period and 42 beneficiaries residing in facilities not 
  certified for Medicare or Medicaid.</p>
