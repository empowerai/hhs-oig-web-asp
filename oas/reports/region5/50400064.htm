<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether Ohio’s methods of computing inpatient
  cost outlier payments were reasonable.&nbsp; Ohio’s “fixed ratio” method of computing inpatient
  cost outlier payments was not reasonable.&nbsp; Instead of using recent cost-to-charge ratios,
  Ohio used outdated fixed ratios to convert allowable billed charges to outlier payments.&nbsp; During
  State fiscal years 2000 through 2003, cost outlier payments to hospitals under this method
  exceeded estimated costs calculated using recent hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios
  by about $24.7 million ($14.5 million Federal share).&nbsp; Because these payments did not
  reflect an efficient and economical application of payment methodology, they were not reasonable.&nbsp; Ohio’s
  two other methods of computing costs outlier payments were reasonable.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services work with the State legislature to revise
  the State’s “fixed ratio” cost outlier payment method to ensure that payments to hospitals
  do not exceed the costs calculated through the application of current cost-to-charge ratios.&nbsp; Ohio
  agreed with our recommendation.</p>
