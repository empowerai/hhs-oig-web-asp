<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our audit entitled, &quot;Review of Medicare 
  Payments for Beneficiaries with Institutional Status.&quot; Our objective was 
  to determine if capitation payments to Humana Health Plan (H1406) were appropriate 
  for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized. </p>
<p>We found that Medicare payments to Humana for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized 
  were generally correct. Our results are based on a statistical sample of 100 
  Medicare beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during the period October 
  1, 1994 through September 30, 1996. We determined the beneficiaries in our sample 
  were correctly reported as institutionalized, with the exception of minor errors. 
  The positive results are attributed to Humana's procedures for verifying the 
  institutional status of its beneficiaries. </p>
