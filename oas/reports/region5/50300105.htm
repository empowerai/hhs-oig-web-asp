<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs reported on Austinwoods&#8217; Calendar Year (CY) 2001 cost
  report were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with applicable Federal and State requirements. Of the total
  costs claimed on Austinwoods&#8217; CY 2001 cost report, $39,104 of indirect costs related to services provided to non-resident
  patients in the physical therapy unit and costs that were not related to patient care were unallowable. &nbsp;The State
  plan requires that costs claimed by nursing facilities must be related to patient care provided to resident patients.&nbsp; The
  unallowable costs were due to a lack of a methodology to identify indirect costs and allocate those costs to the physical
  therapy unit, and, subsequently, between resident and non-resident services as well as weaknesses in their system for classifying
  costs. We recommended that Austinwoods work with the State to adjust the unallowable expenses; establish a methodology
  for costs allocable to the physical therapy unit; and establish policies and procedures to ensure that costs are properly
  categorized.</p>
