<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the Illinois 
Department of Healthcare and Family Services’s (the State agency) claim for 
Medicaid reimbursement for home and community-based services (HCBS) provided by 
Trinity Services, Inc. (Trinity) during State fiscal year (SFY) 2005 complied 
with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; Of the 3,877 HCBS reviewed, 78 were 
unallowable because Trinity did not provide the services or did not meet 
documentation requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that the State agency refund to the Federal Government the $50,670 paid to 
Trinity for unallowable HCBS claimed in SFY 2005 and require Trinity to 
implement internal controls to ensure it documents and claims reimbursement only 
for HCBS actually provided.&nbsp; The State 
agency did not address our first recommendation but stated it would use our 
findings to reiterate required policies and improve its administration of the HCBS program.</span></p>
