<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, the 
State paid $142.3 million ($88.2 million Federal share) to three State-owned 
psychiatric hospitals that were not eligible to receive Medicaid 
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.&nbsp; The hospitals did not meet 
Federal Medicaid eligibility requirements because they did not comply with 
Medicare conditions of participation (CoP) requirements.&nbsp; Generally, hospitals 
demonstrate compliance with basic Medicare CoP through an accreditation process 
performed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 
(JCAHO).&nbsp; Psychiatric hospitals must also meet additional staffing and medical 
records requirements.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State refund $88.2 million to the Federal Government for 
the Medicaid DSH payments made to the three ineligible State-owned psychiatric 
hospitals for the audit period and ensure that Medicaid DSH payments are made 
only to eligible hospitals.&nbsp; The State disagreed with our finding and 
recommendations.&nbsp; The State agency believed that Medicare and Medicaid CoP had 
been met for the facilities through a combination of JCAHO accreditation and the 
Medicaid survey and certification process, including the special CoP for 
psychiatric hospitals.&nbsp; After reviewing the State agency’s comments, we maintain 
that our finding and recommendations are valid.</p>
