<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Allopathic Medicine 
  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at Boston University. The HPSL 
  was implemented through the Public Health Service Act. The Health Resources 
  and Services Administration (HRSA) has overall management responsibilities for 
  the program at the Federal level. <br
wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We determined that the University was appropriately using HPSL funds to provide 
  loans to eligible medical students, with the exception of one loan, and was 
  generally in compliance with regulations concerning the administration of loans. 
  However, our audit revealed that the University was carrying uncollectible loans 
  in their accounting records. </p>
