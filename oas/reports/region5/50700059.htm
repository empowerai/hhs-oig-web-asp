<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">United 
Government Services reported expenditures in its cost proposals that 
substantially complied with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and Medicare 
contract provisions.&nbsp; However, United Government Services understated senior 
executive compensation costs by $320,109 for FY 2004 and overstated senior 
executive compensation costs by $34,013 for FY 2005.&nbsp; In addition, United 
Government Services reported non-senior executive compensation costs that may be 
unreasonable because the costs exceeded maximum benchmark amounts for senior 
executive compensation by $48,774 for FY 2004 and $20,838 for FY 2005.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We 
recommended that National Government Services, which assumed the Medicare 
operations of United Government Services, (1) increase the FY 2004 cost proposal by 
$320,109 and decrease the FY 2005 cost proposal by $34,013 to reflect allowable 
senior executive compensation costs (2) and work with the CMS contracting officer 
to determine the reasonableness of non-senior executive compensation costs of 
$48,774 for FY 2004 and $20,838 for FY 2005 that exceeded benchmark amounts for 
senior executive compensation.&nbsp; National Government Services concurred with our 
finding and recommendation regarding the misstatement of allowable executive 
compensation but disagreed with our finding regarding non-senior executive 
compensation costs that may be unreasonable.</span></p>
