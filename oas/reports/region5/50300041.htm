<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether inpatient
  hospital claims for patients transferred from one hospital to another on the
  same day were properly coded and paid in accordance with North Carolina's Medicaid
  reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; We identified 817 claims, submitted by 111
  hospitals, that appeared to be transfers incorrectly coded as discharges, which
  resulted in overpayments to the transferring hospitals.&nbsp; We limited our
  medical record review to 564 claims from 35 hospitals with total potential
  overpayments greater than $20,000 or with neonatal diagnosis related group
  (DRG) claims with an estimated overpayment per claim greater than $5,000.&nbsp; Of
  these, we determined that 512 claims, totaling $4.7 million at 35 different
  hospitals, were&nbsp; transfers incorrectly coded as discharges.&nbsp; After
  recalculating the correct reimbursement for these transfers, we estimated that
  overpayment to the transferring hospitals amounted to $1,849,683 (Federal share).&nbsp; We
  recommended a financial adjustment for this amount.&nbsp; We also recommended
  that North Carolina reassert Medicaid guidance to hospitals, emphasizing the
  importance of coding the correct patient status and the appropriate DRG with
  special consideration given to the transfer of newborns, and consider implementing
  a postpayment edit to detect improperly coded transfers.&nbsp; North Carolina
  concurred with our findings and took appropriate corrective action.</p>
