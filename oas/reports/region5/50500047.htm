<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The objectives
    of the audit were to determine whether the University (i) developed and implemented adequate
    written procedures and controls relating to cost transfers and (ii) justified and supported
    cost transfers in accordance with Federal regulations and the institution's policies and
    procedures.&nbsp; Although the University developed and implemented adequate written policies
    and procedures and controls relating to cost transfers and generally justified and supported
    cost transfers to NIH grants, staff did not always follow those procedures and cost transfers
    were not always documented and authorized as required.&nbsp; We found that one transfer
    lacked required documentation to explain how the error occurred and four late transfers
    were made without completing or properly authorizing the required form for University oversight
    and approval.&nbsp; Sufficient justification and documentation were ultimately available
    to support the allowability and allocability of the cost transfers to NIH grants.&nbsp; We
    recommended that the University reemphasize cost transfer policies and procedures with
    the Comptroller's and departmental staff.&nbsp; The University agreed with our recommendation.</span></p>
