<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The audit objective was to determine whether administrative costs claimed by 
  the Debra Corn, Inc. child placement agency on its Calendar Year (CY) 2000 cost 
  reports were reasonable and allowable for reimbursement under Indiana’s Foster 
  Care Program (Title IV-E of the Social Security Act).&nbsp; The CY 2000 cost 
  report contained unallowable costs which caused the Indiana Foster Care Program 
  to pay Debra Corn, Inc. $24,533 more than reasonable and necessary for administrative 
  costs (federal share is $10,609).&nbsp; We recommended that the Indiana Foster 
  Care Program recoup the $24,533 in overpayments made to Debra Corn, Inc. and 
  credit the $10,609 federal share to the Federal Government on its next IV-E 
  Financial Report.&nbsp; The State concurred with our audit findings.</p>
