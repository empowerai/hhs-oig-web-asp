<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>M-Care provided managed care services under two Medicare+Choice contracts, 
  the Senior Plan and Senior Plan Prestige, to Medicare beneficiaries in southeastern 
  Michigan.&nbsp; Although M-Care provided additional benefits as proposed in 
  its Adjusted Community Rate Proposal (ACRP) and advertised in its marketing 
  brochures, our review disclosed problems with understated and overstated costs 
  in the ACRP.&nbsp; We also found accounting and payment errors made during the 
  contract year that had some effect on the value that Medicare enrollees received.&nbsp; 
  These errors had a negative impact on M-Care and on Medicare enrollees.&nbsp; 
  In CY 2002, M-Care discontinued the Senior Plan Prestige and drastically reduced 
  the prescription drug cap, from $1,200 to $200 under the Senior Plan.&nbsp; 
  Medicare enrollees now have fewer choices and prescription drug coverage is 
  minimal.</p>
