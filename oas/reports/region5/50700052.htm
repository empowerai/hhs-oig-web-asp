<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Southside Hospital (the provider) reduced costs reported on its fiscal year 2003 Medicare cost report by the $15,074 it received for two vendor rebates.&nbsp;Of the $15,074 in rebates, the provider reduced costs by $9,690 on its fiscal year 2003 Medicare cost report but did not report $5,384, contrary to Federal regulations and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the provider (1) revise and resubmit its 2003 Medicare cost report, if not already settled, to properly reflect the $5,384 rebate as a credit reducing its health care costs; and (2) consider performing a self-assessment of its internal controls to ensure that future vendor rebates are properly credited on its Medicare cost reports. The provider agreed with our recommendations.</p>
