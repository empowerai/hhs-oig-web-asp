<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This review was part of a nationwide analysis of Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; The
  objective of the review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed St. Charles Mercy Hospital (Hospital) for
  outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that the Hospital did not designate a physician
  to directly supervise the services provided by its cardiac rehabilitation program.&nbsp; In addition we could not identify
  the physician professional services to which the cardiac rehabilitation services were provided &#8220;incident to.&#8221;&nbsp; Also,
  the Hospital claimed and received Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services which did not meet
  Medicare coverage requirements, which may not have been supported by medical record documentation, or which were otherwise
  unallowable.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital: (1) work with its fiscal intermediary, AdminaStar, to ensure that
  the Hospital&#8217;s outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance with the Medicare coverage
  requirements for direct physician supervision and for services provided &#8220;incident to&#8221; a physician&#8217;s professional
  service; (2) work with AdminaStar to establish the amount of repayment liability for services provided to beneficiaries
  where medical documentation may not have supported Medicare covered diagnoses and for services not otherwise allowable;
  (3) implement controls to ensure that medical record documentation is maintained to support Medicare outpatient cardiac
  rehabilitation services; and (4) implement controls to ensure that only one unit of service is billed to Medicare for each
  cardiac rehabilitation session provided.</p>
