<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that significant numbers of outpatient psychiatric 
  claims by Provena St. Joseph Hospital for the 15-month period ending November 
  30, 1997 did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements. Specifically, many 
  outpatient psychiatric services were not medically necessary, not supported 
  by medical records, or without any medical record. We estimate, based on a statistical 
  sample, that unallowable charges totaled at least $1.9 million for the above 
  period. We also identified another $97,494 in other unallowable costs for meals, 
  patient transportation, and other costs which were not supported. We recommended 
  financial adjustments. We also recommended that the hospital strengthen its 
  controls and procedures to ensure that charges for outpatient psychiatric services 
  are covered and documented in accordance with Medicare requirements. Finally, 
  we recommended that the hospital develop procedures to exclude unallowable costs 
  from its Medicare cost reports. </p>
