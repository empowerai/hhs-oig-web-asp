<strong><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if Medicaid and Medicare credit 
  balances recorded on Meriter Hospital’s accounting records represent overpayments 
  that should have been reported to those programs.&nbsp; A credit balance occurs 
  when reimbursement for services exceeds the charges billed according to the 
  provider’s accounting records.&nbsp; We found Medicaid overpayments totaling 
  $205,679 and Medicare overpayments totaling $766 were not reported in a timely 
  manner.&nbsp; Therefore, we recommended Meriter ensure that the federal share 
  of the overpayments are recovered by the respective programs.&nbsp; We attribute 
  the untimely identification and reporting of credit balances to provider personnel 
  not being aware of the Medicaid and Medicare reporting requirement and provider 
  policies and procedures not being in accordance with federal and state credit 
  balance reporting requirements.</p>
