<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For August 2003, we estimate that States’ Medicaid agencies 
paid approximately $2 million on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have 
been eligible because of their Medicaid eligibility in another State. &nbsp;The 
payments were made on behalf of these beneficiaries because the States’ agencies 
did not share all available Medicaid eligibility information.&nbsp; Medicaid 
eligibility in each State is based on residency.&nbsp; If a resident of one State 
subsequently establishes residency in another State, the beneficiary’s Medicaid 
eligibility in the previous State should end.&nbsp; The States’ agencies must 
redetermine the eligibility of Medicaid beneficiaries, with respect to 
circumstances that may change, at least every 12 months.<br>
<br>
Based on the results of this audit, we plan to select specific State pairs for 
detailed audits of payments for services provided to Medicaid-eligible 
beneficiaries.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) share 
the results of our audit with all States to (1) emphasize the need to ensure 
that beneficiary eligibility changes are identified and appropriate action is 
taken and (2) encourage States to identify opportunities to use existing 
eligibility data to minimize concurrent Medicaid eligibility periods.<b>&nbsp; </b>
CMS concurred with the recommendations.</p>
