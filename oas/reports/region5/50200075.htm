<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>We reviewed a statistical sample of the records of 200 children from a population of 18,493 children in Indiana who were
  covered by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.&nbsp; Based on the sample, we estimated that the noncustodial parents
  of 4,808 of these children could have contributed about $3.0 million towards the costs paid by Medicaid for medical services
  provided during the period June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002.&nbsp; We recommended that Indiana consider the results of
  our study and pursue collecting the Medicaid costs incurred by the children of noncustodial parents who have medical support
  orders and the ability to pay.</span></p>
