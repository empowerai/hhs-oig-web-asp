<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate whether the Indiana
    Family and Social Services Administration (Agency) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over
    the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; The Agency's controls for reporting rebate information were inadequate and allowed
    inaccurate information to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp; Additionally, the
    Agency did not have controls to ensure all necessary unit and rate conversions were performed to accurately calculate
    the Medicaid drug rebate accounts receivable.&nbsp; We recommended that the Agency prepare and submit corrected reports
    to CMS, and establish controls and implement oversight procedures for the report preparation process and to ensure all
    necessary Medicaid drug rebate unit and rate conversions are performed to conform to Federal financial reporting standards.&nbsp; The
Agency agreed with our findings.</p>
