<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of the Illinois Department of 
  Public Aid (State agency) concerning reimbursement for clinical laboratory services 
  under the Medicaid program for Calendar Years (CY) 1993 and 1994. This report 
  is part of our nationwide review of Medicaid payments for laboratory services. 
</p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine the adequacy of procedures for 
  payment of clinical laboratory claims. Specifically, the audit is designed to 
  determine whether Medicaid payments for chemistry and hematology tests exceeded 
  amounts recognized by Medicare for the same tests or were duplicated. In doing 
  so, we identified tests that were not grouped together (bundled into a panel 
  or profile) for payment purposes. Proper grouping of tests helps to ensure that 
  Medicaid agencies do not reimburse medical providers more for clinical laboratory 
  tests than the amounts Medicare recognizes for the same services. </p>
<p>Our audit disclosed that the State agency did not have certain controls in 
  place to detect and prevent Medicaid payments for laboratory tests in excess 
  of what program guidelines allow. According to the State Medicaid Manual, payment 
  for clinical laboratory tests under the Medicaid program cannot exceed the amount 
  recognized by Medicare. These excessive payments occurred because the State 
  agency was paying a higher price for individual tests than they would have if 
  the tests had been bundled into lower cost panels and profiles. Although the 
  State agency established a system of edits which covered the majority of procedure 
  codes included in our review, the absence of certain edits allowed some improper 
  payments to be made to providers. Our findings are primarily related to two 
  conditions. Specifically, the State agency's claims processing system did not 
  edit for three chemistry procedure codes which the Illinois Medicare carrier 
  bundles into a panel and it did not deny payment for hemogram indices claimed 
  with hemogram profiles. In addition, the State agency's policies and its instructions 
  to providers did not require that the three chemistry procedures in our finding 
  be bundled or specify which hematology procedure codes were duplicative. </p>
<p>We randomly selected a stratified sample of 100 instances involving claims 
  with potential payment errors from a population of 318,051 instances that were 
  extracted from the State agency's CYs 1993 and 1994 paid claims files. We found 
  that 79 of the 100 sampled items were overpaid. Each instance represents a potential 
  payment error in which the State agency paid a provider for clinical laboratory 
  tests (on behalf of the same beneficiary on the same date of service) on an 
  individual test basis, instead of as part of a group, or for tests which were 
  duplicative of each other. Projecting the results of our statistical sample 
  to the population using standard statistical methods, we estimate the State 
  agency overpaid providers $2,194,072 (Federal share $1,097,036) for chemistry 
  and hematology tests. At the 90 percent confidence level, the precision of this 
  estimate is plus or minus $463,671 (21.13 percent). </p>
<p>State agency officials indicated that the three chemistry procedures were not 
  bundled because the tests are not listed as automated, multichannel tests for 
  bundling according to the Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) guidelines. 
  With respect to hemogram indices claimed with hemogram profiles, the State agency 
  relied on the CPT which defines these procedures as &quot;additional&quot; indices. 
  We were advised that instructions to providers are being updated and will be 
  issued in the next year. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the State agency: (1) ensure that its edits detect 
  and prevent payments for unbundled tests and duplicative tests by addressing 
  the specific overpayment causes enumerated in this report; (2) update and clarify 
  its policies and instructions to providers to include additional procedures 
  which are subject to edits for unbundled and duplicate tests; (3) determine 
  the amount of potential overpayment by provider and obtain recoveries of actual 
  overpayments from those providers with the largest total potential overpayments; 
  and (4) make adjustments for the Federal share of the amounts recovered by the 
  State agency on its Quarterly Report of Expenditures to the Health Care Financing 
  Administration (HCFA). Based on our audit, we estimate that $2,194,072 (Federal 
  share $1,097,036) could be recovered from all providers for CYs 1993 and 1994. 
</p>
<p>State agency officials do not agree the two primary findings resulted in overpayments 
  during the audit period. State agency officials do not intend to change their 
  edits or policies for the three chemistry procedures because they believe Medicaid 
  regulations, the CPT handbook, and recent Medicare guidance do not require these 
  procedures to be bundled. For the audit period, the hemogram indices were not 
  considered duplications of hemogram profiles based on recommendations from the 
  State agency's physician consultants and the CPT handbook. Although the projected 
  overpayments did not pertain to several chemistry procedures (see page 6), the 
  State agency agreed it would identify overpayments related to these procedures 
  and refund the Federal share, when recovered. </p>
<p>We believe the two primary findings resulted in overpayments based on Medicaid 
  rules and CPT definitions which existed during the audit period. The State Medicaid 
  Manual precludes paying more for laboratory tests than Medicare pays. The Illinois 
  carrier determined that laboratories frequently perform the three chemistry 
  procedures as part of a panel and, therefore, required these tests be bundled 
  and reimbursed at the lower panel fee since at least 1987. When the State agency 
  reimburses these tests individually rather than as a panel, it pays more than 
  Medicare. By CPT definition, the two hemogram indices duplicate automated hemogram 
  profiles and, thus, should not be reimbursed when claimed with a profile. </p>
