<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice program 
  which directs the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to use 1997 standardized 
  county rates as the basis for all future capitation payments to managed care 
  organizations (MCOs). This final report points out that the 1997 standardized 
  county rates were based on actuarial estimates and, when compared with actual 
  costs incurred, were overstated by 4.2 percent. Applying this overstatement 
  to Congressional Budget Office projections of future Medicare payments to MCOs, 
  we estimate that the inflated payment rates will result in Medicare overpayments 
  to MCOs totaling $11.3 billion over the next five years and $34.3 billion over 
  the next ten years. We recommended that HCFA seek legislation to correct the 
  overstated base year rates, or at a minimum, use this information to suppress 
  or eliminate any future increases in managed care capitation rates until this 
  wide discrepancy is corrected. The HCFA did not concur, stating that the President's 
  Medicare reform package includes a proposal to change the methodology used to 
  set payment rates for MCOs . Since the new methodology will not use the overstated 
  base year rates enacted under the BBA, HCFA officials believe legislation to 
  correct the base year rates is unnecessary. However, because the Medicare reform 
  legislation discussed by HCFA has not passed the Congress, we continue to recommend 
  that HCFA seek legislation to correct the overstated payment rates. </p>
