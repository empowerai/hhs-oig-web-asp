<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>In a prior audit report we found that Healthwin Hospital had received Medicaid 
  overpayments based on a reimbursement system patterned after the Medicare Tax 
  Equity Financial Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). Final settlement of reimbursement 
  levels under this system depended on the number of discharges made during the 
  year. The TEFRA payment system was unsuitable for Healthwin because the hospital 
  served mainly long term patients and had few discharges. Despite the lack of 
  discharges, Healthwin received numerous interim payments from Medicaid and was 
  paid approximately $800,000 over actual costs in 1991. We recommended that the 
  State agency in Indiana confer with the Health Care Financing Administration 
  in negotiating a settlement with Healthwin on all outstanding overpayments. 
  The Indiana State agency concurred and has proposed a settlement of $3.1 million 
  ($2.0 million Federal share) to resolve all overpayment issues for the years 
  1988 through 1995. We reviewed the proposed settlement and related documentation 
  and concluded the settlement amount was reasonable. </p>
