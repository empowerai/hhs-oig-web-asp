<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Senate Finance Committee requested that we assess the 
fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations with respect 
to six specified fiscal integrity areas.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; 
Of the $7.7 million of costs reviewed, $7.6 million appeared reasonable for 
Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; Of the remaining costs, Ohio KePRO Inc. incurred $11,874 
for costs that were unallowable and $78,267 for costs that may not have complied 
with Federal requirements.</span><span style="font-weight: normal"><br>
<br>
We recommended that Ohio KePRO (1) refund $1,622 identified as unallowable 
direct conference-related costs; (2) reduce the indirect cost pool by $10,252 
identified as unallowable indirect costs; (3) work with the CMS contracting 
officer to determine what portion of the $78,267 incurred for unsupported 
subcontractor labor and conference costs should be excluded from Federal 
reimbursement; and (4) maintain all Government-owned equipment in accordance 
with Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements, including performing periodic 
reconciliations of inventories, keeping complete inventory records, and 
reporting any excess equipment.&nbsp; Ohio KePRO generally disagreed with the 
recommendations.</span></p>
