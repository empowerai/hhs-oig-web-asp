<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out best practices and opportunities for States to 
  increase specialized transportation services for the elderly, disabled, and 
  others without a corresponding increase in Federal expenditures. In the 2 States 
  reviewed, only a few communities in each had developed comprehensive coordinated 
  transportation systems. We found those communities were able to provide more 
  services and provide them in a more economical manner. Benefits included increased 
  capacity, better quality of service, improved effectiveness of primary services, 
  cost savings, and upgraded preventive maintenance programs which contributed 
  to greater safety. Recommendations call for the Administration on Aging (AoA) 
  to actively promote transportation consortiums and provide the assistance needed 
  by State agencies and local transit providers to promote coordinated transit 
  systems. The AoA generally concurred with these recommendations. </p>
