<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Michigan Department of
    Community Health (State agency):&nbsp; (i) properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions
    by specific focus areas designated in the cooperative agreements and (ii) whether the State agency had controls and procedures
    to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds.&nbsp; We found that
    the State agency generally accounted for program funds by specific focus area.&nbsp; In response to our inquiry as to
    whether the State agency reduced funding to existing public health programs, State officials replied that Program funding
    had not been used to supplant existing State or local programs.&nbsp; We recommended the State agency continue to comply
    with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements.&nbsp;The State agency
concurred with our findings and recommendation.</p>
