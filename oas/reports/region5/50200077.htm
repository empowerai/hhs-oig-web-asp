<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>
<p> The objective of this audit was to identify the number of children in
  Michigan who received child support (Title IV-D children) and also received Medicaid benefits because their noncustodial
  parents (NCPs) did not provide court-ordered medical support.&nbsp; We also determined the potential savings that could
  have accrued to the Medicaid program if the NCPs had been required to contribute toward the Medicaid costs of these children.&nbsp; We
  projected the sample results to the total population and estimated that the noncustodial parents of 35, 047 children could
  have contributed $10.5 million of the $26.8 million incurred by Medicaid for health benefits for their children.&nbsp; The
  State did not disagree with our recommendation, but has chosen to implement enhancements to its child support enforcement
  system prior to evaluating the cost effectiveness of our recommendation.</p>
