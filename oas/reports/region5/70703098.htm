<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Utah’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that the State had not corrected the control weaknesses for 
any of the findings identified in our previous audit.&nbsp; Manufacturers may make 
their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering into a 
rebate agreement with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and 
paying quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp; In addition, the State had not 
established controls over and accountability for collecting rebates on 
single-source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; Further, the State had not 
reported rebates collected for single-source drugs administered by physicians 
totaling $389,000. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State (1) develop and follow 
policies and procedures to maintain a general ledger accounts receivable control 
account, (2) develop and follow policies and procedures to reconcile the general 
ledger control account to the subsidiary ledgers/records and to the Form 
CMS-64.9R, (3) develop and follow policies and procedures to track and account 
for all $0 unit rebate amounts, (4) develop and follow policies and procedures 
to estimate and accrue interest on all overdue rebate balances,&nbsp;(5) develop and 
follow policies and procedures to make use of the State’s hearing mechanism to 
resolve disputes after 60 days, (6) develop and follow policies and procedures 
to ensure that records are kept for an appropriate period, (7) develop and 
follow policies and procedures to establish controls over and accountability for 
collecting rebates on single-source drugs administered by physicians, and (8) 
refund to the Federal Government $389,000 ($280,000 Federal share) in rebates 
for single-source drugs administered by physicians
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">that were collected but not reported.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The State agreed with all our recommendations except 
those&nbsp;regarding (1) developing and following policies and procedures to estimate 
and accrue interest on all overdue rebate balances and (2) developing and 
following policies and procedures to ensure that records are kept for an 
appropriate period.</p>
