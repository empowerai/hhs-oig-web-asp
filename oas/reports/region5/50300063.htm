<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments
  contained in our database of payments made under the administrative responsibility of Medicare Northwest.&nbsp; We estimated
  that $2.1 million of ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of Medicare Northwest during
  calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within
  the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s claims processing
  systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; Medicare
  Northwest concurred with the findings and recommendations.</p>
