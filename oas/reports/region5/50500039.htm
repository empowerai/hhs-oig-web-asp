<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether the Health Alliance’s Plan
  of Michigan's use of its Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment
  increases was adequately supported and allowable under MMA.&nbsp; We determined that the increased
  MMA payments were used to enhance beneficiary access to providers and to increase the drug benefits.&nbsp; With
  MMA funds provided by Health Alliance, Henry Ford enhanced beneficiary access by opening up seven new
  sites and enrollment increased by approximately 3,000 new Medicare members for 2004. Additionally,
  the drug coverage limit was increased from $200 to $400 for 2004. Therefore, this report contains no
  recommendations for corrective action.</p>
