<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 
<p> The objective of this review was to
    determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed Northfield Hospital (Hospital) for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Our
    review disclosed the Hospital did not designate a physician to directly supervise the services provided by its cardiac
    rehabilitation program.&nbsp; In addition, contrary to current Medicare requirements, we could not identify the physician
    professional services to which the cardiac rehabilitation services were provided &#8220;incident to.&#8221;&nbsp; Also, the Hospital
    claimed and received Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services, amounting to approximately
    $27,013, which did not meet Medicare coverage
    requirements, which may not have been supported by medical record documentation, or which were otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We
    recommended that the Hospital: (1) work with its fiscal intermediary, Noridian Government Services, to ensure that the
    Hospital&#8217;s outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance with the Medicare coverage requirements
    for direct physician supervision and for services being provided &#8220;incident to&#8221; a physician&#8217;s professional service; (2)
    work with Noridian Government Services to establish the amount of repayment liability, estimated to be $27,013, for services
    provided to beneficiaries where medical documentation may not have supported Medicare covered diagnoses and for services
    not otherwise allowable; (3) implement controls to ensure that only one unit of service is billed to Medicare for each
    outpatient cardiac rehabilitation visit; (4) implement controls to ensure that outpatient cardiac rehabilitation service
    documentation is maintained and (5) implement controls to ensure that outpatient cardiac rehabilitation initial evaluations
    without exercise are either performed by a Hospital physician or not billed to Medicare.</p>
