<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">In its fiscal year (FY) 2004 through 
2006 cost proposals, Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation (WPS) reported expenditures that substantially complied with 
the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the Medicare contract provisions.&nbsp; 
However, WPS reported unallowable costs totaling $83,000 
because it overstated costs for management and medical consulting services, executive compensation, postage, and entertainment. &nbsp;Following the close of each 
FY, 
contractors submit to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) a Final Administrative Cost Proposal, which reports 
the Medicare administrative costs incurred during the year.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that WPS 
decrease its cost proposals by $63,000 for FY 2004, $6,000 for FY 2005, and 
$14,000 for FY 2006 to reflect the unallowable costs.<a name="tm_201342142"> </a>
&nbsp;In written comments on our draft report, WPS 
agreed with our findings regarding medical consulting services, executive 
compensation, postage, and entertainment costs and disagreed with our finding 
regarding management consulting services costs. We took WPS’s comments 
into consideration and made appropriate changes to our report.</p>
