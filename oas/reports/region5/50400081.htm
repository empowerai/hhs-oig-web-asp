<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Medicaid administrative costs incurred by community mental health providers in Indiana were claimed and paid in accordance with applicable State and Federal regulations.</p>
<p>Federal reimbursement for the Medicaid Recovery Program was overstated by $328,151 (Federal share) for fiscal year 2003.&nbsp;Our review of Indiana&rsquo;s program oversight disclosed $223,244 in unrecovered net provider overpayments that had previously been identified through State audits, offset by $44,590 of underclaimed provider costs resulting from contractor claim processing errors.&nbsp;Our review at three selected providers disclosed net overpayments of $149,497 for improperly reported costs due to flawed cost allocations, errors, unallowable costs and an incomplete sampling universe.&nbsp;Indiana had not recovered most of the audit-identified overpayments because it mistakenly believed a two-year Federal overpayment recovery limit had lapsed.&nbsp;We recommended that Indiana refund $328,151 and implement procedural refinements to reduce the likelihood of future overpayments.&nbsp;Indiana agreed with the recommendations.</p>
