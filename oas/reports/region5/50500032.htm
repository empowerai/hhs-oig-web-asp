<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objectives were to determine whether (1) Ohio followed the approved
  State plan in administering the Medicaid graduate medical education program and (2) intergovernmental
  transfers included any program funds.&nbsp; We found that contrary to the State plan, Ohio
  paid $1.4 million ($823,883 Federal share) in Medicaid graduate medical education funds to
  18 non-teaching hospitals.&nbsp; The payments were made because Ohio did not periodically
  update information on hospital eligibility.&nbsp; Concerning our second objective, we found
  that intergovernmental transfers did not involve graduate medical education funds.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended
    that Ohio report a $823,883 financial adjustment and review the eligibility of each teaching
    hospital annually.&nbsp; The State questioned the basis for the recommended financial adjustment,
    but did indicate that Ohio would collect the funds that are due back from the hospitals.</span></p>
