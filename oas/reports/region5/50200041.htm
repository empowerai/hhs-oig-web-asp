<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether inpatient hospital claims 
  for patients transferred from one hospital and admitted to another hospital 
  on the same day were properly coded and paid in accordance with Indiana's Medicaid 
  reimbursement methodology.</p>
<p>The medical records confirmed that 97 of the 127 claims reviewed were transfers 
  improperly coded as discharges.&nbsp; Transferring hospitals are reimbursed 
  a diagnosis related group (DRG) pro-rated daily rate for each day, not to exceed 
  the full DRG amount.&nbsp; The Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) 
  claims processing system does not have edits to identify transfers between hospitals, 
  which are erroneously coded as discharges and claimed for the full DRG payment.&nbsp; 
  Based on pricing data provided by OMPP, there were overpayments of $758,681 
  attributed to 92 of the hospital claims.&nbsp; Although coded incorrectly as 
  discharges, the payment methodology for the remaining 5 claims did not result 
  in an overpayment.&nbsp; Subsequently analysis performed by OMPP resulted in 
  lowering the overpayment amount to $739,061.&nbsp; We have reviewed the logical 
  supporting the adjustments and concur with the revised results.</p>
