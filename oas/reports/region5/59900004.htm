<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the Illinois Department of Children and Family 
  Services' (DCFS) claims processing system was not effective in excluding payments 
  to for-profit child care providers ineligible for Federal financial participation 
  (FFP). Section 472 of the Social Security Act requires that foster care payments 
  be made on behalf of eligible children to nonprofit child placement agencies 
  and child care institutions. During the period July 1992 through March 1999, 
  DCFS improperly claimed $11,275,518 (Federal share) for child care payments 
  to for-profit child placement agencies and institutions. We are recommending 
  that the Administration for Children and Families work with the State DCFS to 
  resolve these improperly claimed payments and that DCFS implement controls to 
  preclude the claiming of FFP for foster care payments made to for-profit child 
  care providers. </p>
