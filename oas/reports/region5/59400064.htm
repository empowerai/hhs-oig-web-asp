<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out unallowable costs of $15.6 million claimed 
  by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) for Fiscal Years 1990 through 
  1993. The unallowable costs consisted of, and we recommended financial adjustments 
  for: $8.1 million in costs in excess of the Health Care Financing Administration's 
  (HCFA) notice of budget authorization; $2.4 million for unallowable strategic 
  planning costs that did not directly benefit the Medicare program; $2.1 million 
  in credits due the Medicare program from BCBSM's Medicare secondary payer activities; 
  $1.3 million for unallowable investments; $1.2 million for implementation and 
  maintenance of a claims processing system contrary to a memorandum of understanding 
  with HCFA; and $0.6 million for various items which were unreasonable, not in 
  accordance with Federal regulation, or did not benefit the Medicare program.
