<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Ohio Department of Health (State agency): (i) properly
  recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of
  the cooperative agreements and (ii) whether the State Agency has established controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient
  expenditures of HRSA funds. Based on our validation of a questionnaire completed by the State agency and our site visit,
  we determined that the State agency generally accounted for program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of
  the cooperative agreement. However, the State agency did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, or by priority
  area. In response to our inquiry as to whether the State agency reduced funding to existing public health programs, State
  agency officials replied that Program funding had not been used to supplant existing State or local programs. We recommended
  that the State agency: (i) segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, and by priority area, and (ii) implement the
  site visit component and address problem areas, as they are identified. The State agency concurred with our findings and
  recommendations.</p>
