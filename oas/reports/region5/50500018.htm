<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether (1) Michigan followed the approved State plan in
  administering the Medicaid graduate medical education program and (2) intergovernmental transfers
  included any program funds.&nbsp; We found that contrary to the State plan, Michigan used
  $1.7 million ($955,060 Federal share) in graduate medical education funds for other Medicaid
  services.&nbsp; Also, rather than making the required semimonthly payments, the State paid
  the majority of the total funds during the first 32 days of the fiscal year.&nbsp; In addition,
  the State did not ensure that hospitals accounted for their use of funds by submitting required
  annual reports.&nbsp; Concerning our second objective, we found that intergovernmental transfers
  did not involve graduate medical education funds.</p>
<p>We recommended that Michigan report a $955,060 financial adjustment, adhere to the payment
  method in the approved State plan, and ensure that hospitals comply with reporting requirements
  of the State plan.&nbsp; The State did not agree with the financial adjustment, but did agree
  with the procedural recommendations.</p>
