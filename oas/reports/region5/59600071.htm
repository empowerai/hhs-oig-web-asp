<p align="left"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit to assist in negotiations concerning 
  pension costs charged to Federal programs for plan members of the State Teachers 
  Retirement System of Ohio (STRS). Our audit of pension costs generally covered 
  the period July 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. The purpose of the audit was 
  to determine whether pension costs charged to grants and contracts were in compliance 
  with Federal regulations, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and 
  actuarial standards. </p>
<p>Pension contribution rates must conform to cost principles contained in Office 
  of Management and Budget Circular A-87. The rates must be calculated in accordance 
  with generally accepted accounting and actuarial standards and be actuarially 
  determined. We determined that certain practices clearly do not conform with 
  Federal cost reimbursement principles or applicable actuarial cost methodology. 
</p>
<p>Our audit determined that excessive charges of pension costs to Federal programs 
  result from (i) establishing a contingency reserve to cover liabilities that 
  could result from deviations from actuarial estimates and projections and (ii) 
  using pension fund investment earnings (actuarial gains) to fund a health care 
  reserve instead of to reduce the retirement fund's unfunded liability. </p>
<p>Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 states that contributions 
  to contingency reserves are not allowable charges to Federal programs. The funding 
  of the health care reserve was not in accordance with prescribed actuarial cost 
  methodology, nor was the reserve actuarily determined. Both of these reserves 
  were funded with retirement fund investment earnings which should have been 
  used to reduce the plan's unfunded liability for future retirement benefits. 
  Since amortization of this future liability is a component used in calculating 
  the employer contribution rates, retirement costs charged to Federal programs 
  are overstated. Federal cost principles do not allow reimbursement of increases 
  in employer contributions to a pension plan that result from the maintenance 
  of special reserves which are actuarily unsupported and unjustified. </p>
<p>By using the investment earnings to fund and maintain the two reserves, instead 
  of to reduce the plan's unfunded liability for future retirement benefits, there 
  is a potential future financial impact of approximately $75 million on programs 
  administered by State of Ohio agencies and other entities within the State, 
  including universities and county and local school districts. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) consider these 
  issues in rate negotiations with the State agencies and other entities whose 
  employees participate in STRS. Future pension costs allocable to the Federal 
  government should be reduced by a share of the retirement fund earnings (actuarial 
  gains) inappropriately transferred to the contingency and health care reserves. 
  Effective July 1, 1996, the reserve for future health care benefits must be 
  based on acceptable accounting methodology in accordance with the revised OMB 
  Circular A-87, using either actuarially determined costs or pay-as-you-go financing. 
  The health care reserve maintained during our audit period clearly did not meet 
  either of these criteria. </p>
