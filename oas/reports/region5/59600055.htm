<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides you with the Results of our Audit of Payments to Private 
  Child Placing Agencies under the Title IV-E Foster Care Program in the State 
  of Indiana. The Title IV-E program is administered by the Indiana Family and 
  Social Services Administration (State agency). Our objectives were to determine 
  (i) whether payments claimed for Federal financial participation (FFP) under 
  Title IV-E were made to eligible child placing agencies under contract with 
  the State agency and (ii) whether the child placing agencies were retaining 
  a part of the foster care payment intended for the foster child's maintenance 
  expenses. We also reviewed the State agency's monitoring of child placing agencies 
  to ensure that children placed in foster family homes are receiving adequate 
  and quality care. </p>
