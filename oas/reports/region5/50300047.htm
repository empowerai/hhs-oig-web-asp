<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>OIG evaluated whether the Michigan Department of Community Health (Agency) had established adequate accountability and
  internal controls over the State's Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We determined that the Agency had not reconciled
  the outstanding balance of drug rebate accounts receivable reported on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
  (CMS) 64.9R report to the supporting books and records.&nbsp; We recommended that the Agency develop policies, procedures,
  and controls to ensure that the outstanding rebate amount reported to CMS is reconciled with supporting records.&nbsp; The
  Agency concurred with our finding and recommendation.</p>
