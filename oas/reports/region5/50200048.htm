<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit 
  was to determine if the Texas Medicaid program was reimbursing providers amounts 
  in excess of State Medicare limits for durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies 
  used to provide oxygen.&nbsp; We found that the Medicaid program was overcharged 
  approximately $3.2 million due to excessive Medicaid reimbursement rates.&nbsp; 
  The excessive reimbursements occurred because the State agency set the reimbursement 
  limits for these items above the dollar amount allowed for similar items under 
  the Medicare program.&nbsp; We recommended that the State refund $3,181,518 
  (Federal share $1,969,704) and limit the maximum allowable price for DME and 
  supplies to amounts equal to or less than the Medicare allowable amount for 
  the same items.&nbsp; A State agency official generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
