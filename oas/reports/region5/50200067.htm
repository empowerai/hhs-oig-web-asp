<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether $35,378,132 in costs
  claimed by Welborn Health Plans, Inc. (Welborn) on its Medicare cost reports
  were reasonable, allowable and allocable; in accordance with Medicare provider
  reimbursement principles and guidelines; and whether payments for provider
  services claimed on Welborn&#8217;s cost reports were also reimbursed under the Medicare
  fee-for-service payment system.&nbsp; We consider all costs, except the $700
  claimed for an unallowable and unallocable retirement party, to be reasonable,
  allowable, and allocable.&nbsp; We also determined that the Medicare program
  improperly paid $96,923 in fee-for-service claims submitted by two of Welborn&#8217;s
  providers that were already reimbursed for these services through capitated
  payments. Welborn claimed the capitated payments on its Medicare cost reports.&nbsp; We
  attribute the duplicate payments to Welborn&#8217;s failure to establish required
  internal controls to detect the Medicare fee-for service billings by their
  providers.</p>
