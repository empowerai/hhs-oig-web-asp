<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine the appropriateness of Medicaid payments made
  by the State of Ohio for beneficiaries who were concurrently listed as Medicaid eligible
  in both Ohio and Michigan.&nbsp; We found that the Ohio Medicaid program inappropriately
  paid $333,716 for 471 Medicaid beneficiaries who had established eligibility in both States
  but should only have been eligible in Michigan.&nbsp; We did not determine the appropriateness
  of an additional $56,171 of payments made during the first month of concurrent eligibility
  because Ohio considers the beneficiary eligible for the full month once eligibility is established
  any time during the month.&nbsp; We recommended that the Ohio Department of Job and Family
  Services (State agency):&nbsp; (1) seek recovery of inappropriate payments, estimated to
  be $333,716 ($196,325 Federal share), and refund the Federal share of recovered amounts;
  (2) review claims made in the first month of concurrent eligibility and determine whether
  the payments are allowable; and (3) consider additional procedures for identifying beneficiaries
  moving out of State, including participation in the&nbsp; Public Assistance Reporting Information
  System (PARIS) project and increased sharing of eligibility information with the other State
  Medicaid programs.&nbsp; Ohio officials agreed to perform additional work to determine the
  allowability of reported inappropriate payments.&nbsp; The State agency will consider additional
  procedures and participation in PARIS based on the results of their review.</p>
