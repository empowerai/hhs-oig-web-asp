<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 
<p>This final report points out that for some managed care organizations (MCOs) 
  there was a disparity between the Medicare payment and the cost of the medical 
  care provided to beneficiaries with institutional status. Some MCOs were significantly 
  overpaid while others were significantly underpaid. For example, one MCO had 
  an annual average shortfall of almost $4,500 per beneficiary during 1998, and 
  a second MCO had an annual average overage exceeding $4,000 for each beneficiary 
  during the same period. This disparity in payments may have hurt the Centers 
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ability to provide managed care options 
  to beneficiaries. Underpayments could reduce the number of MCOs willing or able 
  to remain in the Medicare program. If they remain in the program, these MCOs 
  might be forced to target only healthier beneficiaries for enrollment, limiting 
  the health care choices of those individuals who are sicker. To help correct 
  for this the CMS is implementing a risk adjustment methodology based on the 
  beneficiary’s health status, but it is planned to be phased in over the 8-year 
  period 2000 through 2007. We believe that delaying the risk-adjusted payment 
  structure perpetuates the payment problems of the existing system. We recommended 
  that CMS consider the results of our work as it proceeds with the implementation 
  of the risk adjustment factors and seek legislation to accelerate the phase-in 
  of the risk adjustment payment system.</p>
