<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that, based on a statistical sample, the 
  New Center claimed an estimated $1.1 million for partial hospitalization program 
  (PHP) services to Medicare patients that were not reasonable, necessary, or 
  appropriate for the patients' conditions as determined by medical review personnel, 
  and $71,478 for noncovered items in its Fiscal Year 1997 cost report. We recommended 
  financial adjustments totaling approximately $1.2 million. We also recommended 
  that New Center work with the fiscal intermediary to: (1) establish policies 
  to ensure that PHP services provided to Medicare beneficiaries meet Medicare 
  requirements, and (2) establish nonreimbursable cost centers or otherwise exclude 
  costs related to noncovered items from its cost reports. </p>
