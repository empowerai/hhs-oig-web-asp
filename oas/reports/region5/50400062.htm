<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments,
  attributable to Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de Puerto Rico (Cooperativa), contained in a database of payments made under
  the administrative responsibility of nine Medicare Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs).&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated
  that $25,690 of ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of Cooperativa during calendar
  years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred due to the absence of an automated cross-check within the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services Common Working File and the FIs claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive
  day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; Cooperativa has been instructed by the CMS not to seek
  recovery of overpayments identified during our audit and as a result, no recovery activities have been initiated.</p>
