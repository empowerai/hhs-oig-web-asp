<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the 
  Indiana Medicaid program is adhering to its State Plan policy of paying durable 
  medical equipment (DME) suppliers based on the current Medicare payment ceilings 
  for DME items.&nbsp; We identified payments made to 31 providers with the highest 
  amounts of Medicaid reimbursement above Medicare payment levels, for the period 
  October 1, 1997 through September 30, 2000, and found that they were overpaid 
  $2,667,790.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred because the Indiana Office of Medicaid 
  Policy and Planning (OMPP) did not annually review and update its DME payment 
  rates to conform with current Medicare prices.&nbsp; If OMPP had followed its 
  State Plan provision to adjust Medicaid payments to Medicare payment levels, 
  annual savings would have amounted to $889,000, or $4.4 million over a five-year 
  budget cycle.&nbsp; We recommended that the OMPP:&nbsp; (i) reimburse the Centers 
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services $1,637,756 (Federal share) for DME costs 
  claimed that exceeded the Medicare payment ceiling, (ii) consider recovering 
  the DME overpayment from unduly enriched providers, and (iii) adjust its DME 
  payment rates to insure that Medicare payment ceiling levels are not exceeded 
  in the future.</p>
