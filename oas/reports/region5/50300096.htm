<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>During the period covered by our audit, pension costs claimed on the FACPs were overstated by $4,595,563
  because AdminaStar did not fund its pension plan with cash contributions.&nbsp; In addition, executive salary increases
  claimed on the FACPs of $405,035 were excessive because salary increases awarded to selected AdminaStar and Anthem executives
  exceeded the average increases for comparable positions established by the Employment Cost Index (ECI).&nbsp; We are recommending
  financial adjustment of both amounts.</p>
