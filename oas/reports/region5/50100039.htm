<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Recent changes in the Medicare fee schedules, under the Balanced Budget Act
  of 1997, substantially reduced the payment levels for numerous Medicare items.&nbsp; Minnesota’s
  Medicaid State Plan generally provided that medical supplies and equipment
  should be paid at the Medicare fee schedule amount. We reviewed 125,021 paid
  claims (totaling $3,100,615) for oxygen related DME and supplies provided to
  Medicaid recipients during our audit period.&nbsp; We determined that Medicaid
  reimbursements for several oxygen related items exceeded the associated amounts
  allowable under the Medicare payment limits but amounted to only about $2,200
  in Medicaid overpayments.&nbsp; To the State’s credit, these minor overpayments
  were offset by substantial savings attained by using competitive bidding for
  oxygen related DME equipment and supplies.&nbsp; The State has achieved significant
  savings (millions of dollars) by obtaining competitive bids and setting the
  Medicaid allowable rates for oxygen related DME at amounts much less than the
  Medicare allowable rates.</p>
