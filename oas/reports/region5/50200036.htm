<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether administrative costs claimed 
  on the Indiana Youth Advocate's (IYA) cost report for calendar year (CY) 2000 
  were reasonable and allowable for reimbursement under the Foster Care Program 
  (Title IV-E of the Social Security Act).&nbsp; Our audit disclosed that the 
  administrative expenditures reported by IYA on its CY 2000 cost report were 
  reasonable and allowable for reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security 
  Act.&nbsp; Therefore, we have no recommendations to report.</p>
