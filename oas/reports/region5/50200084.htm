<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Saint Luke&#8217;s Medical
  Center (SLMC) currently claimed Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cardiac
  rehabilitation services.&nbsp; We found that SLMC did not designate a physician
  to directly supervise the services provided under its cardiac rehabilitation
  program.&nbsp; In addition, contrary to Medicare requirements, we could not
  identify the physician professional services to which the cardiac rehabilitation
  services were provided &#8220;incident to.&#8221;&nbsp; Based on a statistical
  sample, we estimated that SLMC claimed and received Medicare reimbursement
  for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services, of approximately $47,247, which
  did not meet Medicare coverage requirements, which may not have been supported
  by medical record documentation, or which was otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We
  recommended that SLMC work with its fiscal intermediary to ensure that its
  outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is conducted in accordance with the
  Medicare coverage requirements, and to establish the amount of repayment liability,
  estimated to be approximately $47,247.&nbsp; We also made procedural recommendations
  for internal control improvements.</p>
