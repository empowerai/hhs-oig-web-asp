<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>A Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF) claim generally qualifies for reimbursement 
  only if the SNF stay was preceded by an inpatient hospital stay of at least 
  3 days and the hospital discharge was within 30 days of the SNF admission. This 
  final report estimates, based on a statistical sample, that Medicare inappropriately 
  paid Illinois providers $900,000 for SNF services during calendar year 1996 
  because the 3-day hospital stay requirement was not met. This occurred primarily 
  because the fiscal intermediary (FI) did not cross check SNF claims against 
  hospital claims. The fiscal intermediaries involved in our sample reviewed the 
  medical records and data for the sampled claims and concurred that the SNF stays 
  were ineligible for Medicare reimbursement and indicated they would request 
  refunds for each incorrect payment identified. We recommended that the Health 
  Care Financing Administration monitor the FIs' recovery actions identified in 
  Illinois and report the results through the normal audit resolution process, 
  issue a program memorandum to advise all FIs and SNFs of the results of our 
  review, and consider having the FIs perform a review of the 3-day hospital stay 
  requirement as part of their payment safeguard activities. The HCFA concurred 
  with our recommendations. </p>
