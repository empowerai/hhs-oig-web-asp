<p>Our objective was to determine whether Medicaid administrative costs claimed by Illinois for school-based
  services at two local education agencies for State fiscal year (SFY) 2001 were reasonable, allowable,
  and adequately supported in accordance with applicable Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; We determined
  that the Chicago local education agency claimed unallowable Federal financial participation of $22,976
  for enhanced reimbursement.&nbsp; In addition, time study documentation at both the Chicago and the
  Peoria local education agencies was generally not sufficient for us to verify that skilled professional
  medical personnel expertise was required to perform the activities claimed at the enhanced 75 percent
  rate.&nbsp; We recommended that Illinois refund the $22,976 and work with the local education agencies
  to ensure that sufficient documentation is maintained to allow independent verification that skilled
  professional medical expertise is required to perform all activities claimed at the enhanced rate.&nbsp; Illinois
  agreed.</p>
