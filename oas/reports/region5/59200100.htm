<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report summarizes the results of our analysis of the implementation 
  of the Medicare Part B comparability provision and the impact comparability 
  had on the adjusted historical payment base (AHPB) used to determine payment 
  amounts under Medicare's Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). The Medicare comparability 
  provision provides that the reasonable charge for a service may not exceed the 
  established charge for non-Medicare policy holders of a carrier for a comparable 
  service under comparable circumstances. Our audit of 12 high-dollar volume procedures 
  paid by Blue Shield carriers disclosed that the application of the comparability 
  provision to the Medicare Part B reasonable charges would have saved the Medicare 
  program and its beneficiaries $3.9 million for 1986 and $38.0 million for 1990. 
  In a separate analysis of carrier responses to a 1990 HCFA survey for 30 selected 
  procedures, the increased application of comparability would have reduced Medicare 
  and beneficiaries' payments by $25.6 million. The potential payment reductions 
  associated with the increased application of the comparability provision were 
  significant. Therefore, we recommended that HCFA consider the savings identified 
  in this report when updating the MPFS conversion factor as part of the Medicare 
  volume performance standard rates of increase. </p>
