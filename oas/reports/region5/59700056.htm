</strong> 
<p>This report provides you with our analysis of additional comments, dated August 
  7, 1997, we received from the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration 
  (State agency) in reference to the above audit of Title IV-E payments made to 
  child placing agencies in Indiana. The State agency's additional comments followed 
  their interim response which was appended to our final report (CIN: A-05-96-00055), 
  issued on June 27, 1997. The State agency has not provided any additional information 
  that would cause us to change our recommendations. </p>
