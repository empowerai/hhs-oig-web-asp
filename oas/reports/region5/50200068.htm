<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of the audit was to determine if payments were made for medical 
  services provided after the recipients’ death. For the period October 1, 1998 
  through September 30, 2001, we concluded that the State agency had procedures 
  in place to ensure that payments related to such claimed services were recovered.&nbsp; 
  Accordingly, we determined that there were no reportable weaknesses in this 
  area.</p>
