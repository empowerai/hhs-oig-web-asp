<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The objectives of our audit were to review State agency 
oversight procedures for child support enforcement program contracts and 
determine the allowability of contracted services costs for the Title IV-D child 
support enforcement program administered by the Hamilton County Department of 
Job and Family Services for the period January 1, 2003, through December 31, 
2004.&nbsp; The State agency had extensive policies and procedures in place for 
properly procuring contracted services for the child support enforcement 
program.&nbsp; We found that reviewed charges to the Title IV-D program were 
generally acceptable.&nbsp; We recommend that the State agency continue to emphasize 
its policies and procedures to ensure that County agency allocations for 
contracted services for the child support enforcement program are in accordance 
with benefits received.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">&nbsp;State agency 
officials agreed with the findings and the recommendation.</p>
