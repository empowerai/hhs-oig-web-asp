<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Illinois Department of Public Health (State agency): (i) properly recorded,
  summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus areas designated in the cooperative agreements
  and (ii) whether the State agency had controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention funds.&nbsp; We found that the State agency generally accounted for program funds by specific focus
  area.&nbsp; In response to our inquiry as to whether the State agency reduced funding to existing public health programs,
  State officials replied that Program funding had not been used to supplant existing State or local programs. &nbsp;We recommended
  the State agency continue to comply with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements. &nbsp;The State agency
  concurred with our findings and recommendation.</p>
