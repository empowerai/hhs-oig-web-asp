<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments,
  attributable to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Wyoming (BCBS of Wyoming), contained in a database of payments made under
  the administrative responsibility of nine Medicare Fiscal Intermediaries (FI&#8217;s).&nbsp; Our review of the database
  estimated that $194,247 of ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of BCBS of Wyoming
  during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred due to the absence of an automated cross-check,
  within the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Common Working File and the FI&#8217;s claims processing
  systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; BCBS of
  Wyoming has been instructed by the CMS not to seek recovery of overpayments identified during our audit and as a result,
  no recovery activities have been initiated.</p>
