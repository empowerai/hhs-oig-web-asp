<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This final report points out that the Kaiser Foundation Health 
  Plan, Inc., received Medicare overpayments totaling $229,656 for 315 beneficiaries 
  incorrectly reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 
  through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; Institutional status requirements specify that 
  a beneficiary must be a resident of a qualifying facility for a minimum of 30 
  consecutive days immediately prior to the first day of the current reporting 
  month.&nbsp; The 315 beneficiaries included 266 that had admittance or discharge 
  dates during the 30-day residency period.&nbsp; The remainder consisted of: 
  16 beneficiaries residing in facilities not certified for Medicare or Medicaid; 
  28 beneficiaries for whom institutional residency could not be documented; and 
  5 beneficiaries with hospitals stays greater than 15 days.</p>
