<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The primary objective of this review was to determine if the Wisconsin Department of Health and Families&nbsp; (State
  Agency) had adequate internal controls to ensure medical services provided and claimed for reimbursement under one program
  could not be claimed for Federal financial participation under the other program.&nbsp; Based on our survey work, we concluded
  that the State Agency&#8217;s internal controls were adequate to ensure appropriate reporting of expenditures under the State
Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid programs.&nbsp; No evidence of duplicate claims was identified.</p>
