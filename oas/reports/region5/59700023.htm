<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit entitled, &quot;Review 
  of Medicare Payments for Beneficiaries with Institutional Status.&quot; Our 
  objective was to determine if payments to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, under 
  Medicare risk contract H9003, were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as 
  institutionalized. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We determined Kaiser received Medicare overpayments totaling $10,472 for 20 
  benenficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized. The 20 beneficiaries 
  were part of a statistical sample of 100 Medicare beneficiaries reported as 
  institutionalized during the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1996. 
  Based on our sample results, we estimate that Kaiser received Medicare overpayments 
  of at least $105,624 for beneficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized 
  during the audit period. </p>
