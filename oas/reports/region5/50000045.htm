<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit was made by the Ohio Office of the Auditor and was conducted as 
  part of the Inspector General's partnership efforts with States to expand audit 
  coverage of the Medicaid program. The Office of the Auditor's final report points 
  out that, during a period of almost 6 years, the Ohio Department of Human Services 
  (ODHS) paid $82 million to providers claiming reimbursement for services to 
  beneficiaries who were actually deceased at the time the services were supposedly 
  performed. The ODHS is recovering the overpayments, but $14 million ($8.5 million 
  Federal share) remained outstanding as of September 30, 1999. In addition to 
  the financial adjustments and other procedural corrections, the Office of the 
  Auditor recommended that ODHS propose legislation giving ODHS the authority 
  to develop and apply sanctions against providers who do not report a beneficiary's 
  death in a timely manner, or who bill for or retain unearned reimbursements, 
  including reimbursements for services after a beneficiary's date of death. The 
  ODHS generally agreed with the recommendations. </p>
