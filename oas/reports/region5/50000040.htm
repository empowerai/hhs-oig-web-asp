<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability 
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process 
  for determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed 
  care organizations (MCO). At an Ohio based MCO we identified costs of $629,429 
  that would be considered inappropriate when compared to the Medicare program's 
  general principle of paying only reasonable costs. These costs included direct 
  marketing costs (meetings and souvenirs), bad debts expense, and lobbying. The 
  majority of the costs ($538,036) represented excess allocations of salaries 
  and other administrative expenses to Medicare based on a subjective weighting 
  of employee effort by department managers. In this final report we point out 
  the flaws in the current methodology which results in Medicare covering a disproportionate 
  share of the MCO's administrative costs. Additional reviews are ongoing and 
  preliminary results show similar problems at other MCOs. The results of these 
  reviews are being shared with the Health Care Financing Administration so that 
  appropriate legislative changes can be considered. </p>
