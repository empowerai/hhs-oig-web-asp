<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit of Libertyville 
  Manor Extended Care Facility (Libertyville), a skilled nursing facility.&nbsp; 
  We found that Libertyville was overpaid $301,603 for costs that are not reimbursable 
  according to Medicare guidelines and $205,334 for claims that did not meet the 
  Medicare eligibility and reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; We attribute these 
  overpayments to the provider not following applicable Medicare cost reporting 
  principles and billing for therapy services that were not reasonable, medically 
  necessary, or documented in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; 
  We recommended that the Fiscal Intermediary initiate procedures to recover the 
  total overpayment of $506,937.</p>
