<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM) covered Medicare 
  Part A and Part B administrative costs of $44.6 million claimed during the period 
  October 1, 1994 through July 31, 1999. The audit also included the contractor's 
  termination costs claim submitted to HCFA in July 2000. We recommended a financial 
  adjustment of $1,037,090 because (i) costs for employee retention exceeded the 
  HCFA approved amount by $932,052 and (ii) termination costs of $105,038 were 
  inappropriately included on the Final Administrative Cost Proposal instead of 
  on a separate voucher. BCBSM officials concurred with the recommendation. In 
  addition, we recommended set aside for HCFA adjudication $173,853 of termination 
  costs which consisted of severance payments to employees who retired rather 
  than accept positions offered with the replacement contractor. The BCBSM did 
  not concur with this recommendation. </p>
