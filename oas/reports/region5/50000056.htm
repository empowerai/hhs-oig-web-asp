<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out a method used by Illinois to obtain additional 
  Federal Medicaid funds by circumventing the Medicaid requirement that expenditures 
  be a shared Federal/State responsibility. During the period July 1, 1991 through 
  June 30, 2000, Illinois made about $5.9 billion of enhanced payments to Cook 
  County operated hospitals for inpatient, outpatient, and clinic services under 
  the Medicaid program. About $3.0 billion of the $5.9 billion represented a payback 
  of funds that were initially made as intergovernmental transfers from Cook County 
  to the State. The remaining $2.9 billion represented the Federal share of the 
  payments. About $866.6 million of the $2.9 billion was returned by Cook County 
  to the State as windfall revenue and deposited to the State's General Revenue 
  Fund. Cook County used the enhanced payments to cover costs that would not otherwise 
  qualify for Medicaid funding. Cook County also has used the enhanced funding 
  to supplant the level of State and local tax supported revenue for these operations. 
  Further, although the State contended that it used the funds returned by the 
  County for health-related services, we could not confirm this contention. Among 
  other things, we recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
  take action to place a control on the overall financing mechanisms being used 
  by the State to circumvent the Medicaid program requirement that expenditures 
  be a shared Federal/State responsibility. The HCFA concurred and to address 
  the problem has issued revised regulations to be implemented over a transition 
  period to become fully effective on October 1, 2008. During this transition 
  period we estimate the Federal Government will save $1.2 billion in Illinois 
  alone. </p>
