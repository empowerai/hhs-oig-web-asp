<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to ensure that the mandatory denial of payment remedy for substandard quality of care
  was applied to nursing homes that were not in substantial compliance with the prescribed Medicaid participation requirements
  and to evaluate whether State controls were adequate to prevent improper Medicaid payments to nursing homes under the denial
  of payment remedy.&nbsp; Our audit included denial of payment sanctions, which were in effect from October 1, 1999 to September
  30, 2001. &nbsp; We found that the State permitted improper Medicaid payments for new admissions totaling $30,223 ($17,796
  Federal share) to sanctioned nursing homes.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment and implementation of additional
  procedures, to ensure payments to providers are suspended timely.&nbsp; The dollar amount of overpayments was adjusted
  in response to auditee comments on the draft report.&nbsp; The State agrees with the amount recommended for adjustment
  and concurred with our recommendation for implementation of additional procedures.</p>
