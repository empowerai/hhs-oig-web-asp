<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether IDPA had taken satisfactory 
  corrective actions with respect to previously reported findings related to Medicaid 
  payments for clinical laboratory services. </p>
<p>Our follow-up audit determined that IDPA had implemented certain computer edits 
  and updated its provider instructions as recommended in the previous audit. 
  However, IDPA has not taken any action to recover payments in excess of Medicare 
  bundled rates from the largest providers as previously recommended. In their 
  response to our draft report, the IDPA concurred with our first two recommendations, 
  but did not concur with our recommendations to recover estimated overpayments.
