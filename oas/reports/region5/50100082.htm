<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of discretionary 
  grant number #90EE0322/01 awarded to the West Humboldt Park Family and Community 
  Development Council, Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp; The grant provided $350,000 to 
  purchase and rehabilitate a deteriorating community shopping center.&nbsp; The 
  primary objective was to create at least 60 new full-time jobs with 75 percent 
  being filled by low –income individuals and at-risk youth.&nbsp; Although the 
  Council successfully solicited a real estate developer to purchase and renovate 
  the shopping center, it (i) did not meet the employment goals included in the 
  approved grant proposal, (ii) has not required the real estate developer, or 
  the tenants of the shopping center, to hire individuals meeting the low-income 
  requirements of the grant, and (iii) has not filed a lien with appropriate authorities 
  to protect the Federal government’s interest in the shopping center.&nbsp; The 
  Council contended that the employment objectives of the grant were met but did 
  not provide support for the generation of new low-income or at-risk youth employment 
  and did not respond to our recommendation to record appropriate liens against 
  the real property improved, in part, with Federal funds.</p>
