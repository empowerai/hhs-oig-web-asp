<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this partnership review was to determine the allowability
  of Medicaid claims submitted by ambulance providers for emergency and non-emergency
  transportation services provided to recipients during an inpatient hospital
  stay.&nbsp; Using a computerized detection routine developed by the Illinois
  Department of Public Aid’s (IDPA) Office of Inspector General, the partnership
  identified thirteen ambulance providers who submitted claims for transportation
  services when the recipient was hospitalized.&nbsp; According to Chapter T-204
  of IDPA’s <i>Handbook for Providers of Transportation Services</i>, payment
  will not be made for a hospitalized patient transported to a second hospital
  for outpatient services not available at the hospital of origin.&nbsp; Because
  hospitals typically bill after coinciding transportation bills are submitted,
  prepayment edits by IDPA would not detect transportation services provided
  to recipients during an inpatient stay.&nbsp; These 13 ambulance providers
  were paid $178,294 for unallowable transportation services provided during
  the period April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2002.</p>
