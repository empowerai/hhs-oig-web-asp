<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<h2>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight: normal">
The objective of our review was to determine whether the Indiana Family and 
Social Services Administration (the State agency) made 
payments on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been Medicaid-eligible 
due to their eligibility in Illinois.&nbsp; For the period July 1, 2005, through June 
30, 2006, we estimate that the State agency paid $236,578 ($148,936 Federal 
share) for Medicaid services provided to beneficiaries who should not have been 
eligible because of their Medicaid eligibility in Illinois.&nbsp; </span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency work with the Illinois 
Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid eligibility information for use in 
(1) determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status and (2) reducing the 
amount of payments, estimated to be $236,578 ($148,936 Federal share), made on 
behalf of beneficiaries residing in Illinois.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with the 
recommendations.</p>
