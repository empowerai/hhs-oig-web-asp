<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">This audit was part of a nationwide review of excessive 
payments for outpatient services of $50,000 or more (high-dollar payments).&nbsp; Our 
objective was to determine whether&nbsp;high-dollar Medicare payments that National 
Government Services made to hospitals for outpatient services were appropriate.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><br>
<br>
Of the 45 high-dollar payments that National Government Services made for 
outpatient services for calendar years (CY) 2004 and 2005, only 1 was 
appropriate.&nbsp; The remaining 44 payments included overpayments totaling 
$2,737,857, which the hospitals had not refunded by the beginning of our audit.&nbsp; 
National Government Services made the overpayments because it did not have 
prepayment or postpayment controls to identify aberrant payments at the claim 
level.&nbsp; In addition, neither the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System nor the 
Common Working File had sufficient edits in place during CYs 2004 and 2005 to 
detect and prevent excessive payments.&nbsp; We recommended that National 
Government Services recover the $2,737,857 in identified overpayments.&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">National Government Services agreed with our 
recommendation.</span></p>
