<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>



<p>Our objective was to determine whether the organ 
acquisition costs that Clarian claimed on the calendar year 2000 Medicare cost 
report for its kidney, heart, liver, lung, and pancreas transplant programs were 
allowable.&nbsp; Specifically, we determined whether Clarian complied with Medicare 
law, regulations and guidelines for claiming organ acquisition costs and whether 
it received excess Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; 
Clarian claimed $414,385 in unallowable costs representing duplicated salary 
costs and missing or incorrect adjustments for unallowable costs.&nbsp; Based on 
these unallowable costs, Medicare overpaid Clarian an estimated $270,665.&nbsp; 
Unsupported costs of $2,524,864 did not comply with Medicare documentation 
requirements for reimbursement.&nbsp; If Clarian cannot provide alternative support 
for this amount, a Medicare overpayment of $1,818,679 will exist related to 
unsupported costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We recommended that the Medicare intermediary:&nbsp; (1) recover the Medicare 
overpayment of $270,665 for unallowable costs claimed as organ acquisition, (2) 
work with Clarian to determine the allowable portion of the $2,524,864 in 
unsupported costs and the related Medicare payment of $1,818,679 and recover the 
portion that Clarian is unable to support, (3) review organ acquisition costs 
that Clarian claimed on subsequent Medicare cost reports for issues similar to 
those identified in CY 2000 and recover any Medicare overpayments, (4) monitor 
Clarian’s future Medicare cost report claims for organ acquisition costs to 
ensure compliance with Medicare requirements, and (5) instruct Clarian to 
develop and maintain adequate time studies and accounting controls and to 
provide clear direction to responsible personnel as to Medicare requirements for 
claiming and documenting organ acquisition costs.&nbsp; In response to our draft 
report, officials for the intermediary stated that they could not respond to the 
recommendations until they reviewed our working papers and documentation Clarian 
provided in response to the draft report.&nbsp; Clarian officials agreed with the 
amounts of unallowable costs, but not with amounts for unsupported salaries or 
space.</p>
