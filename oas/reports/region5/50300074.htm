<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine (1) how much revenue three large GPOs received from
  vendors and what the disposition of that revenue was, (2) how members treated distributions of net administrative fee revenue
  received from GPOs on their Medicare cost reports, and (3) whether members properly recorded rebates received from vendors
  on their Medicare cost reports.&nbsp; We found that the three GPOs we reviewed collected $1.3 billion representing net
  revenue in excess of operating costs.&nbsp; The GPOs retained $415 million of the $1.3 billion in net revenue to
  provide reserves and venture capital for new business lines.&nbsp; They distributed the remaining $898 million to members.&nbsp; We
  also found that the GPO members we reviewed did not fully account for the net revenue distributions on their Medicare cost
  reports.&nbsp; GPO members generally offset rebates on their Medicare cost reports as required.&nbsp; We recommended
  that CMS (1) provide specific guidance on the proper Medicare cost report treatment of net revenue distributions received
  from GPOs, and (2) prepare a “frequently asked questions” or other bulletin to remind institutional providers that all
  rebates from vendors must be shown as credits on their Medicare cost reports.</p>
