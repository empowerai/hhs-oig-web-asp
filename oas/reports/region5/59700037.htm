<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides you with the results of our review of the Substance Abuse 
  Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SAPT) programs administered by the Minnesota 
  Department of Human Services, Chemical Dependency Division (State agency). The 
  grant funds were awarded to the State for planning, implementing, and evaluating 
  alcohol and drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation activities. 
  The objective of our review was to determine the adequacy of the State agency's 
  administration of its block grant. <br

  <br wp="br2">
  Generally, the State agency was effectively administering its grant. However, 
  we found that the State agency did not always require its grantee to establish 
  program goals designed to provide a basis for measurable outcomes. We also found 
  that the State agency's peer review process did not meet the requirements of 
  the Public Health Services Act (Act) which requires independent peer reviews 
  of all substance abuse treatment providers. Under current practices, the majority 
  of providers are not subject to peer review and that the reviews incorporate 
  all of the required items. </p>
