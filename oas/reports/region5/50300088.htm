<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the Chicago Department of Public Health (Department): (i) properly
  recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus areas designated in the cooperative
  agreements and (ii) whether the Department had controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds.&nbsp; We found that the Department generally accounted for program funds
  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement and applicable departmental regulations and guidelines,
  with two exceptions.&nbsp; During Year 1 of the Program, the Department did not record, summarize and report transactions
  by specific focus area.&nbsp; We verified that the Department took corrective action and segregated expenditures by focus
  area during the succeeding Program years.&nbsp; In addition, Year 3 original and supplemental funds were not segregated
  in the accounting system.&nbsp; Although the cooperative agreement does not require separate accounting for original and
  supplemental funds, separate reporting of the funds is required.&nbsp; We recommended the Department implement procedures
  to record, summarize, and report expenditures for original and supplemental grant funds separately.&nbsp; Department officials
  generally concurred with our findings and recommendation.</p>
