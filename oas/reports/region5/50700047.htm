<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Methodist Germantown Hospital (the provider) reduced costs reported on its fiscal year 2003 and 2004 Medicare cost reports by the $12,621 it received for two vendor rebates.&nbsp;The provider did not reduce costs reported on its fiscal year 2003 and 2004 cost reports by the $12,621 it received for two rebates, contrary to Federal regulations and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the provider (1) revise and resubmit its 2003 and 2004 Medicare cost reports, if not already settled, to properly reflect the $12,621 in rebates as credits reducing its health care costs; and (2) consider performing a self-assessment of its internal controls to ensure that future vendor rebates are properly credited on its Medicare cost reports. The provider agreed with our recommendations.</p>
