<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare 
  fee-for-service claims paid in Ohio during the 3-year period of January 1, 1997 
  through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with federal regulations and Centers 
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines.&nbsp; Ohio was 1 of 10 States 
  selected for review.&nbsp;&nbsp; We reviewed a randomly selected statistical 
  sample of 100 claims.&nbsp; We found that all 100 sample claims were appropriate.&nbsp; 
  The sample included 92 claims for beneficiaries in psychiatric hospitals operated 
  by the Ohio Department of Mental Health.&nbsp; We determined that these beneficiaries 
  did qualify for Medicare coverage because under State law, the beneficiaries 
  were responsible for repayment of medical costs and the State did pursue collection.&nbsp; 
  The final eight claims in our sample were also allowable because the beneficiaries 
  were not incarcerated on the day of the medical service.</p>
