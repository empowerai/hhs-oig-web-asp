<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that Associated Insurance Companies (AIC), 
  a Medicare intermediary, overclaimed administrative costs totaling approximately 
  $2.5 million for Fiscal Years 1994 through 1995. The overclaim resulted because 
  AIC understated complementary insurance credits, claimed unreasonable executive 
  salary increases, claimed pension costs that were not funded, claimed non-Medicare 
  related costs, claimed costs that exceeded actual costs, and overstated return 
  on investment. In addition to procedural corrections and improvements to internal 
  controls, we recommended a financial adjustment for $2.5 million. The AIC did 
  not concur with most of our recommendations. </p>
