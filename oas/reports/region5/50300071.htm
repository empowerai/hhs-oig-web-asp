<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent
    of ineligible Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments contained in our database of payments made under the administrative
    responsibility of Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc. (Anthem).&nbsp; We estimated that $1.8 million of ineligible SNF
    payments were made under the administrative responsibility of Anthem during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The
    overpayments occurred because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
    Services Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive
day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.</p>
