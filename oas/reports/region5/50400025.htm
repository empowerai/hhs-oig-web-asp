<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine
    the extent of Medicare Part B overpayments made to physicians by Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation (WPS)
    for billings with incorrect place of service codes.&nbsp; Seventy-nine of 100 sampled physician services were performed
    in a facility, but were inappropriately billed by a physician using the incorrect &#8220;office&#8221; place of service code.&nbsp; Medicare
    regulations provide for higher payment for medical procedures that are performed in non-facility settings versus those
    performed in facility settings.&nbsp; We recommended that WPS (1) recover identified overpayments totaling $1,948; (2)
    work with the physician population to reassess their billings and refund estimated overpayments totaling $742,510; (3)
    educate physicians about the importance of correctly reporting place of service codes; and, (4) work with the Medicare
    fiscal intermediary to identify physician services with potentially high risk for place of service coding errors, and
recover program overpayments that result from these errors.</p>
