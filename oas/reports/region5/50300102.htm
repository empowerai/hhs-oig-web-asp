<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report consolidates the results of our audits of Medicare outpatient cardiac rehabilitation provided
  by 34 hospitals.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether hospitals had complied with national
  Medicare outpatient cardiac rehabilitation coverage requirements for direct physician supervision and &#8220;incident
  to&#8221; services.&nbsp; Twenty-nine of the 34 hospitals in our sample relied on emergency physicians
  or &#8220;code&#8221; teams in other parts of the hospital to provide physician supervision when the
  medical directors were not available, while the remaining 5 hospitals designated a particular physician
  to provide direct physician supervision.&nbsp; Thirty-two of the 34 hospitals considered the patient&#8217;s
  referring physician as the physician whose professional services the cardiac rehabilitation was provided &#8220;incident
  to,&#8221; while the other 2 hospitals relied on the professional services of a hospital physician.&nbsp; We
  attributed this to inconsistent guidance in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, Hospital Manual, and
  Intermediary Manual.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS: (1) clarify national Medicare cardiac rehabilitation coverage requirements
  on the provision of direct physician supervision and the physician (referring or hospital) whose professional
  services the cardiac rehabilitation must be &#8220;incident to&#8221; and (2) direct fiscal intermediaries
  to educate hospitals on the clarified national Medicare coverage policy for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation
  services.&nbsp; In its comments on our draft report, CMS agreed to develop and publish provider education
  materials to clarify the direct physician supervision and &#8220;incident to&#8221; provisions of the
  cardiac rehabilitation benefit.</p>
