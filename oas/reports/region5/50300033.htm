<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke&#8217;s Medical Center (Rush) was reimbursed
  properly for outlier payments made during the initial implementation of the Outpatient Prospective Payment System.&nbsp; We
  determined Rush was reimbursed improperly on 38 of the 50 outpatient claims that were reviewed, which resulted in 35 overpayments
  and 3 underpayments.&nbsp; The 35 overpayments were attributable to a problem within the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s (FI)
  claims processing system and totaled $7,726.&nbsp; The three underpayments of $7,752 pertained to improperly billing Medicare
  for implantable devices.&nbsp; Rush should have billed these implantable devices using a specific HCPCS code, which would
  have resulted in a higher claim reimbursement with no outlier payment.&nbsp; We recommended Rush refund the overstated
  outlier overpayments of $7,726 and resubmit the claims with the improperly billed implantable devices in order to recover
  the identified underpayments of $7,752.&nbsp; Rush concurred with our findings and will work with their FI in addressing
  our recommendations.</p>
