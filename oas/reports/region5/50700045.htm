<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 






<h1><span style="font-weight: normal">The objective of our review was to 
determine whether Option Care, Inc. (the provider) reduced costs reported on its 
fiscal year 2003 Medicare cost report by the $173,805 vendor rebate it received.&nbsp; For the $173,805 rebate reviewed, the provider did not reduce costs reported on 
its 2004 Medicare cost report by $43,451, contrary to Federal regulations and 
CMS guidance. </span></h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">We recommended 
that the provider (1) revise and resubmit its 2003 Medicare cost report, if not 
already settled, to properly reflect the $43,451 portion of the rebate as a 
credit reducing its health care costs and (2) 
consider performing a self-assessment of its internal controls to ensure that 
future vendor rebates are properly credited in its Medicare cost reports. &nbsp;The 
provider disagreed with our finding and recommendations.</p>
