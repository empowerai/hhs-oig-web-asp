<hr noshade><strong><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective of this joint review with the OIG of the Illinois Department 
  of Public Aid (IDPA) was to develop and validate a time dependent billing routine 
  that would identify practitioners who submitted claims for more time than is 
  feasible in a day.&nbsp; The time dependent billing routine identified practitioners 
  who billed for one or more 12-hour days for dates of service from July 1, 1998 
  to June 30, 2000, inclusive.&nbsp; These physicians had charged for more time 
  than is feasible in a day.&nbsp; We recommended that IDPA instruct physicians 
  to submit properly coded claims based on the level of care and time spent by 
  the physician with each patient.&nbsp; The IDPA concurred with our findings 
  and recommendation.</p>
