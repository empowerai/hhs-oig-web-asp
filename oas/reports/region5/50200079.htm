<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Through a computerized data match, we identified $1,030,416
    in fee-for-service (FFS) payments for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) during State
    fiscal year 2001.&nbsp; A detailed review of $554,246 of the FFS claims found unallowable FFS and MCO payments of $34,168
    (federal share $20,165).&nbsp; Section 447.45(f) of 42CFR requires State plans to conduct prepayment reviews to verify
    that claims do not duplicate or conflict with other received claims.&nbsp; We found that Medicaid claims processing edits
    in place to prevent payment of FFS claims for managed care enrollees were bypassed.&nbsp; We recommended a refund of
    the identified overpayments, a review of the remaining FFS payments for MCO enrollees and improvements to internal controls.&nbsp; State
    officials generally disagreed with our recommendations.</p>
