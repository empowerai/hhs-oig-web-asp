<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>In 1990 Indiana contracted with the Institutes for Health and Human Services, 
  Inc. (IHHS) to enhance title IV-E reimbursement by identifying additional eligible 
  foster care claims. Based on the work of IHHS, Indiana submitted retroactive 
  claims for Calendar Year 1993 totaling $8.5 million for reimbursement. Our audit 
  was made to determine whether adequate documentation was available to support 
  the retroactive claims. This final report points out that such documentation 
  was not available. The State has continually been unable to locate supporting 
  documentation originally submitted by IHHS and has been unsuccessful in its 
  attempts to obtain duplicate copies from the IHHS. Also, the IHHS did not respond 
  to letters and phone call from the State requesting copies of the supporting 
  documents in accordance with the terms of their contract, nor did IHHS return 
  our follow-up telephone calls. Therefore, we recommended that the State make 
  a financial adjustment for the $8.5 million. The State concurred with our recommendation 
  and made the financial adjustment. </p>
