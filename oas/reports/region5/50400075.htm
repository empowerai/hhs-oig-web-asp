<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the State agency appropriately reported program
  income for undistributable child support collections and interest earned on program funds.&nbsp; The
  State agency did not report program income totaling $2,870,137 ($1,894,291 Federal share)
  for undistributable child support collections and did not recognize program income of $500,352
  ($330,233 Federal share) for unclaimed and undistributable collections that should have been
  considered abandoned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency: (1) adjust program income for undistributable collections
  of $2,870,137 ($1,894,291 Federal share); (2) work with State officials and county agencies
  to transfer $500,352 ($330,233 Federal share) of unclaimed collections to trust fund accounts
  and recognize undistributable collections as program income after 5 years; and (3) work with
  State officials and county agencies to implement policies and procedures and provide program
  oversight to ensure that future undistributable collections, after being unclaimed for 5
  years, are recognized as program income on the quarterly Federal financial report.&nbsp; The
  State agency agreed with the audit findings.</p>
