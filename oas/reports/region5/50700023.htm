<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the State agency’s 
claim for Medicaid reimbursement of home and community-based services (HCBS) 
provided by Dungarvin during State fiscal year (SFY) 2005 complied with Federal 
and State requirements.&nbsp; Of the 100 sampled beneficiary-months reviewed, the 
State agency claimed Medicaid reimbursement for services from 15 
beneficiary-months that were unallowable because Dungarvin or Hennepin County 
did not adequately document the services in accordance with Federal or State 
requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We 
recommended the State agency:&nbsp; (1) refund $301,001 to the Federal Government, 
(2) 
require the Hennepin County office to strengthen its internal controls to ensure 
that it maintains individual service plans (ISPs) in accordance with Federal and 
State requirements and provides current ISP to Dungarvin, and (3) require Dungarvin to strengthen its internal controls to ensure it maintains ISPs, which 
includes the plans of care, in accordance with Federal and State requirements 
and documents and claims reimbursement for MRRC waiver services actually 
provided in accordance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; The State agency 
did not address our first recommendation but agreed with the two other recommendations.</span></p>
