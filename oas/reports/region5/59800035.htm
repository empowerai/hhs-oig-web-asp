<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Allopathic Medicine 
  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at the University of Florida. 
  The HPSL program was implemented through the Public Health Service Act. The 
  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has overall management responsibilities 
  for the program at the Federal level. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We determined that the University was appropriately using HPSL funds to provide 
  loans to eligible medical students and was appropriately administering the HPSL 
  funds. However, we identified one account which should have been classified 
  as an uncollectible loan. We are recommending that the University reimburse 
  the HPSL fund an amount of $8,226 for the uncollectible HPSL loan. </p>
