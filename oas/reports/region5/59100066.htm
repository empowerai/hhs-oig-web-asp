<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Ohio Department of Administrative Services (ODAS) had the responsibility 
  for the procurement of data processing equipment used by various State departments 
  and agencies. The ODAS billed the user agencies for the equipment. This report 
  points out that billings to the agencies during the period July 1, 1982 through 
  June 30, 1989 included about $8.2 million ($4.9 million Federal share) of interest 
  expense and other unallowable costs related to the acquisitions. The unallowable 
  charges to Federal programs are attributed to a lack of adequate procedures 
  to identify interest expense and account for the cost of the equipment. We recommended 
  that ODAS work with the other user agencies in establishing procedures to identify 
  and properly account for the costs of data processing equipment. We also recommended 
  that ODAS make a financial adjustment of $4,897,056 (Federal share) for costs 
  improperly charged to Federal programs through June 30, 1989. State officials 
  generally concurred with our findings and recommendations. </p>
