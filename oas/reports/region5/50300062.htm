<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare
  Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments contained in our database of payments
  made under the administrative responsibility of Noridian Mutual Insurance Company
  (Noridian).&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated that $2.4 million of
  ineligible SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of
  Noridian during calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred
  because of the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary&#8217;s
  claims processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient
  hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; Noridian agreed with our
  findings.&nbsp; However, per CMS instructions, Noridian will not initiate recovery
  action until further guidance is received from CMS.</p>
