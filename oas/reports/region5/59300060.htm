<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report recommends that the State of Indiana make a financial 
  adjustment of $2.5 million (Federal share) for computation errors made in 1991 
  when setting reimbursement rates for State-owned Intermediate Care Facilities 
  for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MRs). We also recommend that the State amend 
  State Plan provisions which permit special rate increases to accommodate changes 
  in Federal/State laws and regulations. As currently written the provisions are 
  too vague to be consistently applied. State agency and regional officials of 
  the Health Care Financing Administration concurred with our findings and recommendations.
