<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if capitation payments to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan were appropriate
  for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined that Kaiser received Medicare overpayments totaling
  $11,214 for 15 beneficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized.&nbsp; The 15 beneficiaries were part of a statistical
  sample of 100 Medicare beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1996 through December 31,
  1998.&nbsp; Based on our sample results, we estimate that Kaiser received Medicare overpayments of at least $49,963 for
  beneficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized.&nbsp; The majority of the overpayments occurred because, prior
  to 1997, Kaiser staff did not consistently verify the institutional residency of beneficiaries.</p>
