<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report provides the results of
    our audit entitled, &quot;Review of Medicare Payments for Beneficiaries with
    Institutional Status.&quot;&nbsp; Our objective was to determine if payments
    to Humana Health Plan (Contract H2649) were appropriate for beneficiaries
    reported as institutionalized. We determined that Humana received Medicare
    overpayments totaling $84,808 for 27 beneficiaries incorrectly classified
    as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 through December 31,
    2000.&nbsp; Most of these beneficiaries were residents of domiciliary type
    facilities that do not qualify a beneficiary for institutional status.&nbsp; Humana
  should not have received payment at the enhanced institutional rate.</p>
