<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For fiscal years 2004 and 2005, Illinois claimed $108,000 
in Medicaid reimbursement for drugs that were no longer eligible for 
reimbursement.&nbsp; <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">The </span>Medicaid drug 
rebate program generally pays for covered outpatient drugs if their 
manufacturers have rebate agreements with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services (CMS) and pay rebates to the States.&nbsp; Under the drug rebate program, 
CMS provides the States with a quarterly Medicaid drug tape, which the States 
use to verify coverage of the drugs for which they claim reimbursement.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
An additional $3.5 million represented expenditures for drug products that were 
not listed on the quarterly drug tapes.&nbsp; Because the State did not verify 
whether these drugs were eligible for coverage, these expenditures may not have 
been allowable.&nbsp; We identified no other errors for the remainder of the $1.9 
billion (Federal share) that the State claimed.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) refund $108,000 to the Federal Government
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">for drug expenditures that were not eligible 
for Medicaid coverage<a name="tm_603988008">, (2) </a>work with CMS to resolve
</span>$3.5 million <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">in payments for drugs 
that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have been 
eligible for Medicaid coverage<a name="tm_603988014">, </a>and (3) </span>
strengthen internal controls to ensure that claimed Medicaid drug expenditures 
comply with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State agreed with the first two 
recommendations and disagreed with the third recommendation.</p>
