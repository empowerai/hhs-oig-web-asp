<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit, performed by Doshi &amp; Associates, P.C., covered administrative 
  costs claimed by the Health Care Services Corporation (HCSC), a former Medicare 
  Part A and Part B contractor, for the period October 1, 1994 through September 
  30, 1998. Their final report points out that HCSC's claims included unallowable 
  costs totaling approximately $9.9 million over this period. The majority of 
  the unallowable costs ($7.9 million) were bonuses that were part of an employee 
  retention plan rejected by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) as 
  unreasonable and unnecessary. The bonuses consisted of a 50 percent increase 
  in salary paid through the transition period and most of the employees were 
  absorbed into &quot;HCSC's private business operations or accepted positions 
  with the new Medicare contractor. Other major exceptions involved employee placement 
  services costs of $374,629 that were included in the retention plan rejected 
  by HCFA, severance pay of $509,912 which exceeded compensation levels specified 
  in an approved plan, and Year 2000 project costs of $738, 759 incurred after 
  the notice of termination. We are recommending financial adjustments totaling 
  $9.9 million. </p>
