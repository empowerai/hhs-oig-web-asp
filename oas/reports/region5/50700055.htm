<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Staten Island Hospital (the provider) reduced costs reported on its fiscal years 2003 and 2004 Medicare cost reports by the $48,014 it received for two vendor rebates. The provider properly reduced its fiscal year 2004 Medicare cost report by $33,410 for one rebate.&nbsp;However, the provider did not reduce costs reported on its fiscal year 2003 cost report by the remaining $14,604 rebate, contrary to Federal regulations and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the provider (1) revise and resubmit its 2003 Medicare cost report, if not already settled, to properly reflect the $14,604 rebate as a credit reducing its health care costs; and (2) consider performing a self-assessment of its internal controls to ensure that future vendor rebates are properly credited on its Medicare cost reports.&nbsp;The provider agreed with our recommendations.</p>
