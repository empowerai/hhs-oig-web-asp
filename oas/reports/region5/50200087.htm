<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the extent of ineligible Medicare
  Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) payments contained in our database of payments
  made under the administrative responsibility of United Government Services
  (UGS).&nbsp; Our review of the database estimated that $23.3 million of ineligible
  SNF payments were made under the administrative responsibility of UGS during
  calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred because of
  the absence of an automated cross-check, within the Centers for Medicare and
  Medicaid Services' Common Working File and the Fiscal Intermediary’s claims
  processing systems, verifying that a three consecutive day inpatient hospital
  stay occurred prior to SNF admission.&nbsp; The UGS agreed with the findings
  and recommendations presented in the report and will initiate recovery actions
  for the inappropriate payments.</p>
