<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">This audit was part of a nationwide review of targeted 
case management (TCM) Medicaid program payments. &nbsp;Our objective was to determine 
whether&nbsp;the State agency’s claim for Medicaid reimbursement of TCM services 
provided during fiscal years (FY) 2003 and 2004 complied with Federal and State 
requirements.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Based on our review of 118 claims in 100 sampled beneficiary-months, 7 claims 
included in 7 beneficiary-months were unallowable because the services were 
insufficiently documented or unsupported by the case records.&nbsp; As a result, we 
estimate that during FYs 2003 and 2004, the State agency claimed $7,311,860 
($3,759,338 Federal share) in TCM costs that were unallowable.&nbsp; We considered 
the remaining 111 claims included in 93&nbsp;beneficiary-months to be acceptable.&nbsp;
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
<br>
We recommend that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government the 
$3,759,338 for undocumented and unsupported TCM services and (2) ensure that TCM 
services claimed under the Medicaid program are properly documented and meet 
Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; In written comments on our draft report, the 
State agency did not address our recommendations.</span></p>
