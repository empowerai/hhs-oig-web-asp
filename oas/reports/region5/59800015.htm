<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Allopathic Medicine 
  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at Indiana University - Purdue 
  Univeristy (IU-PU). The HPSL program was implemented through the Public Health 
  Service Act. The Health Resources Services Administration has overall management 
  responsibilities for the program at the Federal level. </p>
<p>We determined that the University was appropriately using HPSL funds to provide 
  loans to eligible medical students and was appropriately administering the HPSL 
  funds. However, we are recommending that the University develop a means to identify 
  loans that are about to exceed the ten-year repayment period. </p>
<p>In a letter dated July 23, 1998, Indiana University concurred with our recommendations 
  and has begun implementing procedures to identify, at least semi-annually, uncollectible 
  loans. The full text of the University's comments is attached as an appendix 
  to this report. </p>
