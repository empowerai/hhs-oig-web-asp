<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine the amount of Medicaid overpayments resulting from payments to providers
  for medical services provided after the recipients&#8217; death.&nbsp; We found that for the period October 1, 1998 through
  September 30, 2000, the Michigan Department of Community Health did not identify all payments for medical services provided
  after death.&nbsp; Based on the results of a statistical sample, we estimate that unallowable payments of approximately
  $294,500 (Federal share $161,000) were not recovered.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency did not credit the Federal Government
  for payments that it had identified as unallowable.&nbsp; The State agency determined that $81,425 (Federal share $45,429)
  was not processed for adjustment or collection from the providers.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with the findings and
  recommendations. </p>
