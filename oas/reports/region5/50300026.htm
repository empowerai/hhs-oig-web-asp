<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This OIG report estimates that $8.1 million in ineligible Medicare Skilled
  Nursing Facility (SNF) payments were made under administrative responsibility
  of CareFirst of Maryland, Inc. (CareFirst) during calendar years 1997 through
  2001.&nbsp; The overpayments occurred because of the absence of an automated
  cross-check between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Common Working
  File and the Fiscal Intermediary’s claims processing systems to verify that
  a three consecutive day inpatient hospital stay occurred prior to SNF admission. &nbsp;CareFirst
  agreed with the findings and recommendations presented in the report and will
  initiate recovery actions for the unallowable SNF claims.</p>
