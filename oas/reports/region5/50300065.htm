<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Michigan&#8217;s methodology and calculations for the upper payment
  limit&nbsp; (UPL) and related payments were reasonable and in accordance with revised Federal regulations and the approved
  State plan.&nbsp; Our audit period covered the implementation of the new UPL regulations for State Fiscal year 2003.&nbsp; Our
  review disclosed that the Michigan UPL and the related payments were reasonable and calculated in accordance with the revised
  Federal regulations and the approved State plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the UPL payments were properly included by Michigan
  when calculating disproportionate share hospital specific payment limits.</p>
