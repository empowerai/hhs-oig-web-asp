<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objectives of our audit were to determine whether the State agency: recorded and reported Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention (CDC) bioterrorism program funds in accordance with the cooperative agreement; ensured that the bioterrorism
  preparedness program funds were used for necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs under the terms of the cooperative
  agreement; and did not supplant current State or local funding with bioterrorism preparedness program funds.&nbsp; We determined
  that the State agency properly recorded and reported bioterrorism preparedness program funds awarded, expended, obligated,
  and unobligated by focus area in accordance with the cooperative agreement; generally ensured that bioterrorism preparedness
  program funds were used for necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs under the terms of the cooperative agreement;
  and did not supplant current State or local expenditures with bioterrorism preparedness program funds.&nbsp; We recommend
  that the State agency: ensure bioterrorism preparedness program activities are funded in a manner to minimize unobligated
  fund balances and to achieve bioterrorism preparedness program goals, and ensure the inadequately documented costs of $4,154
  at the Jefferson County subrecipient are properly resolved.&nbsp; In response, the CDC officials agreed with the findings
  and recommendations.</p>
