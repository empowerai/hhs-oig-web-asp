<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of the audit was to determine whether the Illinois Department of Healthcare
  and Family Services (State agency) properly claimed Medicaid funding at the 75 percent enhanced
  Federal funding rate for skilled professional medical personnel for the period October 1,
  2003, through September 30, 2004.&nbsp; The State agency improperly claimed enhanced reimbursement
  for skilled professional medical personnel costs and was overpaid $62,648 in Federal funds
  for wage and travel expenses for 56 contractors that were not State agency employees.&nbsp; In
  addition, the State agency improperly classified and claimed $9,460,819 ($2,365,205 Federal
  share) in school based administrative costs as skilled professional medical personnel.&nbsp; Although
  CMS disallowed enhanced reimbursement for these claims, the State agency did not reclassify
  and reduce its claim for skilled professional medical personnel.&nbsp; We recommended that
  the State agency:&nbsp; (1) refund $62,648 for the overpayments; (2) develop and implement
  procedures to ensure only qualifying individuals are claimed as skilled professional medical
  personnel; and (3) reclassify the $9,460,819 in school based administrative costs inappropriately
  claimed for enhanced reimbursement as skilled professional medical personnel and appropriately
  charge those costs as other Medicaid administrative costs.&nbsp; Illinois officials agreed
  to the first two recommendations.&nbsp; The State did not agree with our recommendation to
  reclassify the $9,460,819 in school based administrative costs.</p>
