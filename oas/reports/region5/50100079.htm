<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this audit 
  was to determine if payments to Blue Care Network (Contract H9009) were appropriate 
  for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized. We determined that Blue Care 
  received Medicare overpayments totaling $100,692 for 54 beneficiaries incorrectly 
  reported as institutionalized during the period January 1, 1998 through December 
  31, 2000.&nbsp; The majority of the beneficiaries did not meet the 30-day residency 
  requirement in a qualifying institutional facility.&nbsp; Blue Care Network 
  should not have received payment at the enhanced institutional rate.</p>
