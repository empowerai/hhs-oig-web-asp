<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides results on the Ohio Office of the Auditor's (OOA) 
  audit of Medicaid clinical laboratory services in Ohio for Calendar Years (CY) 
  1993 and 1994. This work was conducted as part of the OIG's partnership efforts 
  with State Auditors to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program. The OOA 
  determined that Ohio's Department of Human Services was reimbursing providers 
  for laboratory services that were not properly grouped together or that were 
  duplicated for payment purposes. The OOA estimates that ODHS overpaid these 
  providers by $5.2 million (Federal share $3.2 million) in CYs 1993 and 1994. 
  The overpayments occurred because ODHS's Medicaid processing section did not 
  have adequate edit routines built into the computer programs used to screen 
  provider billings. The OOA recommended that the State agency develop edit routines 
  that would detect unbundled and duplicate billings prior to payment and install 
  the routines in the programs ODHS uses to screen provider billings. The Chief 
  of Internal Audits of ODHS concurred with the findings. </p>
