<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) claimed Medicare Parts A and 
  B administrative costs for the period October 1, 1993 through October 31, 1994, 
  totaling $54,475,362. Of the $54,475,362 in administrative costs claimed, we 
  consider $52,688,017 to be acceptable and recommend a financial adjustment of 
  $1,787,345 ($1,129,843 - Part A and $657,502 - Part B). </p>
<p>We found that Medicare costs were overstated because: 
<ul>
  <li>Costs of $562,490 claimed as severance pay to employees who were hired by 
    the replacement contractor did not meet the definition of severance pay as 
    provided in the Federal regulations and are unallowable.<br wp="br1">
  </li>
  <li>Complementary insurance credits were understated by $419,003 because BCBSM 
    did not include cost allocations from all cost centers that benefit the complementary 
    claims process and did not use the appropriate allocation rates when calculating 
    the applicable credits.</li>
  <li>Professional consultant costs claimed of $314,337 were unallowable.<br wp="br1">
  </li>
  <li>Post retirement benefit costs were allocated to all lines of business instead 
    of directly identified with the appropriate business segment. As a result, 
    Medicare costs were overstated by $145,583.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Data entry costs were overstated by $134,434 because BCBSM allocated these 
    costs to Medicare using outdated production reports that did not accurately 
    reflect the actual work performed.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Contingent expenses claimed of $121,320 were unallowable.<br wp="br1">
  </li>
  <li>Executive incentive awards were allocated to Medicare through cost centers 
    that were inconsistent with BCBSM's allocation plan and the allocation of 
    all other executive costs. As a result, Medicare costs were overstated by 
    $52,812.</li>
  <li>Costs for the personal use of automobiles of $24,071 were unallowable.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Miscellaneous income credits were understated and Medicare costs claimed 
    were overstated by $13,295.</li>
</ul>
<p>In their written response to our draft report, BCBSM generally did not concur 
  with our findings and recommendations. We have summarized BCBSM's responses 
  following the individual findings and recommendations and have provided our 
  comments where appropriate. </p>
