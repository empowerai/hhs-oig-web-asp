<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This audit covered costs claimed by AdminaStar Federal (AdminaStar) on final
  administrative cost proposals for Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; Costs claimed
  totaled $193,455,170: $81,763,259 for Part A, $71,399,257 for Part B, and $40,292,654
  for durable medical equipment regional carrier (DMERC) operations.&nbsp; Of
  the total claimed, we recommended a financial adjustment of $4,694,863: $2,171,529
  for Part A, $1,602,931 for Part B, and $920,403 for DMERC operations.&nbsp; We
  also found that information to support the prior approval of leases and the
  volume of claims used to compute complementary credits was not available.&nbsp; We
  recommended that AdminaStar provide the necessary documentation to the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services for review.&nbsp; Adjustments to the Final
  Administrative Cost Proposals should be made if necessary.</p>
