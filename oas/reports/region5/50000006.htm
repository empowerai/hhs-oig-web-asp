<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final letter report presents the results of our Audit of Medicaid Claims 
  for Services Identified as Mutually Exclusive Procedure Codes. The objective 
  of our review was to determine the extent of potential overpayments or savings 
  that could accrue to the Federal government and the State of Michigan if edits 
  were implemented to identify and deny payments for procedure codes that the 
  Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) had identified as mutually exclusive. 
  We determined that the State agency currently had edits in place that require 
  pre-defined combinations of procedure codes to be reviewed before payment is 
  made. Based on our review of payments for radiology and laboratory services 
  made during our audit period of January 1, 1996 through September 30, 1998, 
  we found that savings of approximately $240,000 could have been realized had 
  these edits been in place. </p>
