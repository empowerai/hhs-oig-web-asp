<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and Health Network (the provider) reduced costs reported on its 2004 Medicare cost report by the $34,579 vendor rebate it received.&nbsp;The provider did not reduce costs reported on its fiscal year 2004 cost report by the $34,579 rebate, contrary to Federal regulations and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the provider (1) revise and resubmit its 2004 Medicare cost report, if not already settled, to properly reflect the $34,579 rebate as a credit reducing its health care costs; and (2) consider performing a self-assessment of its internal controls to ensure that future vendor rebates are properly credited on its Medicare cost reports. The provider agreed with our recommendations.</p>
