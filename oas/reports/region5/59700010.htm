<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objectives of our reviews were to assess the effectiveness of the procedures 
  established to identify, investigate and resolve reports of elder abuse in Illinois 
  long-term care (LTC) facilities and to evaluate the accuracy and completeness 
  of the certified nurse aide (CNA) registry. We also determined whether LTC facilities 
  employed alleged abusers, who had undisclosed criminal backgrounds which would 
  have been identified if the Illinois Health Care Workers Background Check Act 
  (HCWBC Act) had been implemented sooner. </p>
