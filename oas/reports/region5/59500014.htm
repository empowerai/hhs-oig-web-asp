<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>We have completed a limited review of pension costs charged to Federal programs 
  in Ohio for the period July 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994. The purpose 
  of the review was to determine whether pension costs charged to grants and contracts 
  were in compliance with Federal regulations, generally accepted accounting principles 
  (GAAP), and actuarial standards. <br wp="br1">
  <br wp="br2">
  We determined that excessive charges to Federal programs have resulted from 
  delayed transfers of pension contributions to the Public Employees Retirement 
  System (PERS). The financial impact was determined to be approximately $380,000 
  annually on Federal programs administered by the State of Ohio. </p>
