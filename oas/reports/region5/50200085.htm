<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Ohio made unallowable Medicaid fee-for-service
  (FFS) payments for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care organizations (MCO).&nbsp; Based on a statistical sample
  of 200 claims, we estimated that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services paid unallowable Medicaid claims totaling
  $4.6 million ($2.7 million Federal share) for services covered by Medicare MCOs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001.&nbsp; The
  State's processing system for Medicaid claims did not have controls to prevent payment of FFS claims for services covered
  by Medicare managed care.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and improvements to internal controls.</p>
