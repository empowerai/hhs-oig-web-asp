<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</P>
</STRONG>
<P>This review was part of a nationwide analysis of Medicare
    reimbursement for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services requested by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    to determine the level of provider compliance with national Medicare outpatient cardiac rehabilitation policies.&nbsp; The
    objective of our review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed Evanston Northwestern Healthcare for outpatient
    cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that the hospital did not designate a physician to directly
    supervise the services provided by its cardiac rehabilitation program.&nbsp; In addition, contrary to current Medicare
    requirements, we could not identify the physician professional services to which the cardiac rehabilitation services
    were provided &#8220;incident to.&#8221;&nbsp; Also, the hospital claimed and received Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cardiac
    rehabilitation services which did not meet Medicare coverage requirements, which may not have been supported by medical
    record documentation, or which were otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We recommended that the hospital: (1) work with its
    fiscal intermediary to ensure that its outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance with
    the Medicare coverage requirements for direct physician supervision and for services provided &#8220;incident to&#8221; a physician&#8217;s
    professional service; (2) work with its intermediary to establish the amount of repayment liability for services provided
    to beneficiaries where medical documentation may not have supported Medicare covered diagnoses and for services not otherwise
    allowable; (3) bill evaluation and orientation visits only when performed by physician personnel in accordance with local
    medical review policy; and (4) implement controls to ensure that medical record documentation is maintained to support
Medicare outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.</P>
