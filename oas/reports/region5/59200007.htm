<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit report summarizes the results of our review of the Health Care Financing 
  Administration's (HCFA) methods for defining, and otherwise identifying, physician 
  services that should be subject to payment limitations based on the site of 
  service. Payment should continue to vary by site of service because practice 
  expenses differ between office and non-office sites. We recommended that HCFA 
  add a high-volume criterion to the existing definition of services routinely 
  performed in physicians' offices and use the revised definition to identify 
  physician services subject to the payment limitation. We also recommended that 
  the payment limitation be expanded to include the inpatient hospital and skilled 
  nursing facility settings. We estimate that our recommendations could result 
  in annual program and beneficiary savings of approximately $170 million. </p>
