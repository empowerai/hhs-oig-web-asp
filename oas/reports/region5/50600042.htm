<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the Department of 
Healthcare and Family Services (the State agency) made enhanced payments for 
services provided by physicians employed by the University of Illinois at 
Chicago College of Medicine (UIC) and the Southern Illinois University School of 
Medicine (SIU) in accordance with the approved State plan amendment (SPA) and 
Federal regulations. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency generally made enhanced payments for 
services provided by UIC and SIU physicians in accordance with its SPA and 
Federal regulations.&nbsp; However, the State agency overpaid the universities 
$304,726 ($152,363 Federal share) due to a computer program error used to 
calculate the enhanced payment for 8,844 claims within a portion of our audit 
period.&nbsp; The computer program error occurred on claims that had a third party 
liability payment that exceeded the cost of services.&nbsp; We recommended that the 
State agency refund the overpayment of $152,363 to the Federal Government and 
correct the computer program error that caused the overpayments and ensure that 
claims with third party liability payments that exceed the cost of services do 
not receive a standard Medicaid fee or an enhanced payment.&nbsp; The State 
agency 
concurred with the findings and recommendations.</p>
