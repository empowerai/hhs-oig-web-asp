<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether United
  Government Services (UGS) had an effective system of internal controls and
  whether $197 million of administrative costs were claimed in accordance with
  the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as interpreted and modified by the Medicare
  contract.&nbsp; The UGS internal controls were generally adequate and we accepted
  $196.7 million in costs claimed.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments
  totaling $260,831 for excessive executive compensation increases, unallocable
  guarantee fees, and overcharged corporate overhead.</p>
