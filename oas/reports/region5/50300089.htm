<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the Chicago Department of Public Health (Department): (i) properly
  recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of
  the cooperative agreements and (ii) had controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of HRSA funds.&nbsp; We
  determined that the Department generally accounted for program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
  cooperative agreement.&nbsp; However, the Department did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, or by priority
  area.&nbsp; Under new guidelines effective August 31, 2003, grantees will be required to maintain a financial accounting
  system capable of tracking expenditures by priority area, critical benchmark, and by funds allocated to hospitals and other
  health care entities.&nbsp; We also found that the Department included indirect costs of $62,360, or approximately 14 percent
  of the total costs expended.&nbsp; HRSA guidance restricts grantees to indirect costs of 10 percent.&nbsp; We recommended
  the Department: (i) implement procedures to comply with the new requirements, and (ii) monitor indirect costs to ensure
  that it does not exceed the 10 percent restriction imposed by HRSA.&nbsp; Department officials generally concurred with
  our findings and recommendations.</p>
