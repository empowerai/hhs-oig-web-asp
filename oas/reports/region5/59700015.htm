<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit evaluated Medicare eligibility determinations of terminal illness 
  for beneficiaries enrolled in hospice care at Samaritan Care, Inc. Working with 
  us, physicians from a peer review organization reviewed the medical records 
  for 180 beneficiaries and determined that 130 beneficiaries were not eligible 
  for hospice coverage. As a result, overpayments of Medicare funds to the hospice 
  totaled approximately $2.6 million for these beneficiaries for the period November 
  1, 1993 through March 31, 1995. Ninety-eight percent of the 130 ineligible beneficiaries 
  were nursing home patients. This points out the continuing problem with hospice 
  coverage in nursing facilities as an underlying factor that contributes to high 
  levels of beneficiary ineligibility. The Health Care Financing Administration 
  should give high priority to developing a legislative proposal to address this 
  issue. </p>
