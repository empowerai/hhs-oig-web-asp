<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This letter report provides the results of
    our audit of discretionary grant number #90EE0298/01, awarded to Impact Seven,
    Inc., Almena, Wisconsin.&nbsp; The grant provided $600,000 (Federal share)
    and $3,102,000 from non-Federal sources to purchase land, rehabilitate buildings,
    construct new retail and manufacturing facilities for expanding businesses
    and industry, and develop low-income housing in Ashland, Wisconsin.&nbsp; Although
    Impact Seven purchased, rehabilitated and constructed retail and business
    properties and low-income housing in the Ashland community, it (i) did not
    construct all of the retail and business properties proposed in the grant,
    (ii) has not met the grant employment goals, and (iii) is unable to document
    the percent of low-income individuals employed by the tenants benefiting
  from the grant.</p>
