<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>During Fiscal Years (FY) 1994 and 1995 the State of Wisconsin operated a Title 
  IV-F JOBS program but the expenditures far exceeded the approved ceiling. Title 
  IV-A waiver savings funds were approved, in part, to cover the excess spending. 
  The waiver savings funds required a dollar for dollar matching contribution 
  from the State. We determined that the expenditures assigned as matching cost 
  to the waiver savings program supplanted normal State job training activities. 
  The State has concurred that it inappropriately claimed $1,497,464 ($748,732 
  Federal share) for FY 1995 and $5,140,249 ($2,570,125 Federal share) for FY 
  1994. </p>
