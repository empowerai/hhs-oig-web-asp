<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review 
  was to determine if payments to Fallon Community Health Plan (Contract H9001) 
  were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; The 
  final report points out that Fallon received Medicare overpayments totaling 
  $18,842 for 44 beneficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized during 
  the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; All of the beneficiaries 
  were residents of domiciliary type facilities that did not qualify a beneficiary 
  for institutional status.&nbsp; Fallon should not have received payment at the 
  enhanced institutional rate.</p>
