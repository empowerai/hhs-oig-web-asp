<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Medicare payments to managed care organizations
  (MCOs) were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; Medicare pays a higher monthly rate to MCOs
  for such beneficiaries.&nbsp; Based on a statistically valid sample of 8 of 79 MCOs, we found the MCOs incorrectly claimed
  801 beneficiaries as institutionalized from January 1998 through December 2000.&nbsp; We estimate overpayments totaled
  about $9.5 million.&nbsp; The major cause of the overpayments was that the MCOs did not adequately verify that the beneficiaries
  had met residency requirements before claiming them as institutionalized.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and
  that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services improve oversight procedures to better identify MCOs that inappropriately
  claim beneficiaries as institutionalized.</p>
