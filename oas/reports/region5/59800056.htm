<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Pharmacy Health 
  Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at the University of Missouri-Kansas 
  City. The HPSL program was implemented through the Public Health Service Act. 
  The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has overall management 
  responsibilities for the program at the Federal level. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We determined that the University was generally in compliance with regulations 
  concerning the administration of loans. However, our audit revealed that the 
  University was carrying uncollectible loans in their accounting records. </p>
