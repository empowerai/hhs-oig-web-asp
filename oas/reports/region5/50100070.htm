<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if capitation payments to Group 
  Health Plan (Contract H2663) were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as 
  institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined that Group Health Plan received Medicare 
  overpayments totaling $11,089 for 13 beneficiaries incorrectly classified as 
  institutionalized.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 13 beneficiaries were part of a statistical 
  sample of 100 Medicare beneficiaries, reported as institutionalized during the 
  period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999.&nbsp; Based on our sample 
  results, we estimate that Group Health received Medicare overpayments of $98,689 
  for beneficiaries incorrectly reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; The causes 
  of the overpayments include difficulties with Group Health’s verification and 
  reporting process, incorrect information provided by nursing facilities, and 
  an incorrect interpretation of institutional payment regulations.</p>
