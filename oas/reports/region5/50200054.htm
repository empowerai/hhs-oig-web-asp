<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The audit objective was to determine whether costs claimed by UGS for Medicare
  Y2K remediation were allowable and properly allocated.&nbsp; Our review showed
  UGS improperly charged Y2K for $45,278 of compensation for supervisors working
  less than 100 percent on Y2K; could not support other compensation costs of
  $3,724; and claimed unallowable employee meal costs of $921.&nbsp; We recommended
  UGS amend its FACP to charge supervisor compensation of $45,278 to non-Y2K
  Medicare activities and make a financial adjustment for the remaining $4,645.</p>
