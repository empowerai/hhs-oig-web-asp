<hr noshade><strong><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Federal regulations require that states pursue Aid to Families with Dependent 
  Children (AFDC) overpayments made prior to October 1, 1996, and make appropriate 
  refunds to the Federal Government. This final report points out that the State 
  of Wisconsin had not made such refunds for overpayments collected ($10.7 million 
  Federal share) during the period July 1, 1996 through September 30, 2001. In 
  addition to procedural corrections, we recommended financial adjustments totaling 
  $10.7 million.</p>
