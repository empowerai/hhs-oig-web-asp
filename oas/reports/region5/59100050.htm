<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our audit of Community Mental Health 
  Centers (CMHC) construction grant reviews performed by a contractor, Continuing 
  Medical Education, Inc. (CME), for the National of Institute of Mental Health, 
  (NIMH) Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration. We found CME generally 
  identified and reported areas of grantee noncompliance for the grantees we reviewed 
  except for the provision of a reasonable volume of below-cost or free services 
  to persons unable to pay. However, CME reports generally contained sufficient 
  information for NIMH to take actions to bring the grantees back into compliance, 
  initiate recovery or extend the service obligation date. However, NIMH did not 
  adequately monitor or resolve reported deficiencies. </p>
