<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the Wisconsin Medicaid
  School-Based Services (SBS) program was effectively and efficiency managed
  by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) and the SBS
  providers.&nbsp; Our review showed the Wisconsin DHFS and SBS providers generally
  managed the SBS program in a effective and efficient manner.&nbsp; We did,
  however, identify some areas needing improvement:&nbsp; (1) the administrative
  cost calculation used an unrestricted indirect cost rate which included indirect
  costs not necessary for the management of the Medicaid program, and (2) providers
  did not always bill for SBS identified in individual education plans, properly
  bill on dates beneficiaries received services, or maintain required supporting
  documentation.&nbsp; As a result, we determined that the Wisconsin DHFS and
  SBS providers claimed and received at least $315,474, in Medicaid federal financial
  participating (FFP) for costs not allowed or supported by adequate documentation
  during state fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.&nbsp; In regard to the indirect
  cost rate issue, we recommended DHFS work with the Centers for Medicare and
  Medicaid Services to establish the appropriate indirect cost rate.&nbsp; We
  also recommended the Wisconsin DHFS:&nbsp; (1) refund $315,474 in FFP for costs
  not allowed or supported by adequate documentation, and (2) reemphasize Medicaid
  policies to providers and require them to implement effective internal controls
  to ensure SBS are properly provided, billed, and documented.</p>
