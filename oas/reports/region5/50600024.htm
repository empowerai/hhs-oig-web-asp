<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The audit objective was to determine whether the percentage 
of unobligated Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program (Bioterrorism Program) 
balances decreased from program year 2002 to program year 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The percentage of unobligated Bioterrorism Program balances 
decreased from program year 2002 to program year 2004.&nbsp; Based on OIG’s analysis 
of available financial status reports submitted by awardees, unobligated 
balances declined from 15.7 percent of the awarded funds for program year 2002 
to 5.1 percent of the awarded funds for program year 2004.&nbsp; Because program year 
2004 had not expired for six grantees as of the completion of the audit (January 
9, 2007), these grantees could further reduce their unobligated balances.&nbsp; The 
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has contributed to the 
reduced percentage of unobligated balances by strengthening its oversight, 
training, and onsite monitoring of awardees and by using available enforcement 
actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">OIG recommended 
that HRSA continue to use available monitoring tools and enforcement actions to 
reduce unobligated funds until such time as the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response assumes responsibility for the Bioterrorism Program.&nbsp; 
HRSA concurred with the recommendation.</span>
