<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This letter report provides the results of our audit of the Allopathic Medicine 
  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Program at the Medical College of Wisconsin 
  (the College). The HPSL program was implemented through the Public Health Service 
  Act. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has overall management 
  responsibilities for the program at the Federal level. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We determined that the College was appropriately using HPSL funds to provide 
  loans to eligible medical students and was generally in compliance with regulations 
  concerning the administration of loans. However, our audit revealed that the 
  College was carrying uncollectible loans in their accounting records. </p>
