<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This final report, which resulted from a request by the Acting Administrator 
  of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), presents the results 
  of our Audit of&nbsp; Title II Funding under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS 
  Resources Emergency (CARE) Act in Indiana.&nbsp; The Title II program was administered 
  by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) and its terminated sub-grantee, 
  AIDServe Indiana, Inc. (AIDServe).&nbsp; For the three year period ending March 
  31, 2001, ISDH claimed costs, amounting to $18,425,641, for the AIDServe operation 
  of the Title II and related programs, which included unallowable, unallocable, 
  and unapproved claims, amounting to $784,499, and inadequately supported claims 
  of $5,337,802.&nbsp; Although the ISDH was actively involved in the administration 
  of the Title II program, increased oversight and involvement could have assured 
  that required audits were performed and corrective actions were taken to prevent 
  or alleviate many of the conditions disclosed during the audit.&nbsp; We recommended 
  that ISDH refund unallowable, unallocable and unapproved costs amounting to 
  $784,499.&nbsp; We set aside inadequately supported costs amounting to $5,337,802 
  for HRSA’s adjudication.&nbsp; Finally, we recommended that ISDH increase its 
  oversight of other sub-grantees and ensure that required audits are performed 
  in a timely manner.</p>
