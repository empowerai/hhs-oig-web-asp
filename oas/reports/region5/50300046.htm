<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>OIG evaluated whether the Wisconsin Department
    of Health and Family Services (Agency) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over the State's
    Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We determined that the Agency had not&nbsp;reconciled the outstanding balance of
    drug rebate accounts receivable, reported on the Form CMS 64.9R report, to the supporting records, or established adequate procedures to accrue interest for late or disputed rebate payments.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Agency (1) correct the outstanding balance on Form CMS 64.9R for an understatement of $3,329,034, and (2) develop
  procedures to (a) ensure that the reported outstanding rebate amount is reconciled with the supporting records and (b)
  to account for the interest related to late, disputed, or unpaid rebate payments.&nbsp; The Agency generally agreed with
  our recommendations, except for developing procedures to account for the interest.&nbsp; We agree with the corrective action
  taken, to date, while maintaining our belief that the Agency should establish procedures to verify that the correct interest
  was paid for unpaid, late, and disputed drug rebates.</p>
