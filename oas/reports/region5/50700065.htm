<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether high-dollar Medicare 
payments that National Government Services made to providers for outpatient 
services were appropriate.&nbsp; Most of the high-dollar Medicare outpatient payments 
were not appropriate.&nbsp; For calendar years 2004 and 2005 claims, National 
Government Services made 79 payments of $50,000 or more for outpatient 
services.&nbsp; Our analysis indicated that only 13 payments were correct and the 
remaining 66 payments were inappropriate.&nbsp; At the start of our fieldwork in May 
2007, 53 payments, totaling $3,338,895, had been refunded by the 
providers and 13 payments, totaling $513,796, remained outstanding.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended that 
National Government Services (1) inform us of the status of the recovery of the 
$513,796 in overpayments that our audit identified, (2) identify and recover 
additional overpayments made on high-dollar outpatient claims paid after 
calendar year 2005, and &nbsp;(3) use the results of this audit in its provider 
education activities.&nbsp; National Government Services agreed with our 
recommendations.</span></p>
