<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This audit is one of a series of reviews the Office of Inspector General is 
  conducting under our &quot;Strategic Plan for the Oversight of Managed Care&quot;. 
  The findings from this review may result in a special managed care fraud alert. 
  The final report points out that Medica, a health maintenance organization, 
  received improper payments under its Medicare risk-based contract on behalf 
  of beneficiaries who were improperly classified as institutionalized. We estimate 
  the improper payments totaled at least $861,615 over a 5 year period. In addition 
  to a financial adjustment, we recommended that Medica establish more prescriptive 
  policies and procedures for monitoring and reporting their beneficiaries' institutional 
  status. Medica officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations.
