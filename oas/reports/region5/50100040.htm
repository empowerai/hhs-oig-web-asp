<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The report provides the results 
  of our audit of Contract No. 277-94-3009; entitled the National Resource Center 
  for the Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Abuse and 
  Mental Illness in Women, and Grant No. UHSPO8041, entitled the Child Study Center 
  Behavioral Health Project, for two year audit periods ending June 30, 1999 and 
  September 29, 1999, respectively.&nbsp; Based 
  on procedures agreed upon with officials from the Substance Abuse and Mental&nbsp; 
  Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), we audited costs incurred amounting 
  to $942,608 for the contract and $847,043 for the grant.&nbsp; In relation to 
  the contract, we are questioning costs of $34,994 based on a lack of adequate 
  accounting records or approved cost limits being exceeded.&nbsp; Related indirect 
  costs of $9,488 was also questioned, while we express no opinion on the remaining 
  balance of $104,505, which was&nbsp; not adequately supported.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 
  grant documentation was not available to support the allowability of $847,043 
  in costs incurred during the audit period, we are unable to express an opinion 
  on these costs.&nbsp; We discussed the results of our review with&nbsp; NAFARE 
  officials, who agreed with our audit results.&nbsp; A summary of the costs claimed 
  and the auditor's recommendations for each of the cost categories was provided 
  to SAMHSA.</p>
