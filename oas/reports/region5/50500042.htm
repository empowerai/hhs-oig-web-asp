<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of the audit was to determine whether services performed by the Dean Health Plan, Inc.’s
  capitated provider were also being reimbursed under the Medicare fee-for-service payment system. We
  determined that Dean's capitated provider filed Medicare claims, for which they were paid on a fee-for-service
  basis, while under a capitation arrangement with Dean.&nbsp; The capitation arrangement, which provides
  for a per member, per month payment to Dean's capitated provider, covered allowable service performed
  by the provider to Dean's enrollees.&nbsp; Medicare reimbursed Dean for the capitation payments made
  to the provider via the Medicare cost reports; therefore, the fee-for-service claims paid directly
  to the provider by Medicare are considered overpayments.&nbsp; During our audit period, inappropriate
  Medicare fee-for-service billings by Dean's capitated provider amounted to $91,710.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that Dean recover the $91,710 in duplicate Medicare fee-for-service claims made to
  the capitated provider and that Dean develop an efficient and effective billing process system to preclude
  and detect duplicate payments from the capitated provider.&nbsp; Dean Health Plan, Inc. agreed with
  our recommendations.</p>
