<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that excellent progress is being made at the provider 
  level in converting Medicare claims processing to a total electronic environment. 
  As in all new systems, however, there are growing pains. Additional provider 
  guidance would be beneficial for defining needed internal controls and the responsibilities 
  of each provider in the claims process. Those still submitting hard copy claims 
  need further encouragement to convert to a electric media claims (EMC) processing 
  environment. We recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
  consider (1) developing additional guidance and instruction on internal controls, 
  (2) providing free training and cost-benefit information on EMC to providers 
  still submitting hard copy claims, and (3) phasing in requirements that Medicare 
  providers with significant paper claims volume convert to EMC. The HCFA concurred 
  with our recommendations and noted several steps already taken to implement 
  them. </p>
