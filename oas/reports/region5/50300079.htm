<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives 
were to determine whether the Michigan Department of Community Health (State 
agency): (i) properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism 
preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
cooperative agreements and (ii) had controls and procedures to monitor 
sub-recipient expenditures of HRSA funds.&nbsp; We determined 
that the State agency generally accounted for program funds in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement. However, the State agency 
did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, or by priority area. 
State officials indicated that they were establishing procedures to comply 
with the requirements in the new HRSA Cooperative Agreement Guidance, effective 
August 31, 2003. We also found the State agency had controls and procedures to 
monitor sub-recipient expenditures of Program funds.&nbsp; We recommended the 
State agency implement procedures to comply with the new requirements effective 
August 31, 2003 and begin tracking expenditures by priority area, critical 
benchmark, and by funds allocated to hospitals and other health care entities. 
The State agency concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
