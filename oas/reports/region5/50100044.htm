<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p >The purpose of this review was to determine whether 
  payments for services provided during October 1, 1998 through September 30, 
  1999 were: (i) provided by eligible providers (ii) medically necessary, and 
  (iii) in compliance with the required Medicaid billing practices.&nbsp; We found 
  that the State agency had performed only limited program monitoring to assure 
  that compliance requirements were met. Based on a statistical sample of 100 personal care service claims, 
  we identified 33 improper payments amounting to $14,844 and 17 claims lacking 
  compliance documentation for requirements that negatively affect the 
  quality of service rather than the propriety of the payment.&nbsp; These later 
  non-compliance situations may affect the well being of a large number of vulnerable 
  recipients and should be addressed by increased State agency monitoring of the 
  personal care program.&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency recover 
  payments for the improper claims totaling $14,844 and develop oversight mechanisms 
  that would ensure compliance with program requirements.&nbsp; The State agency 
  concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
