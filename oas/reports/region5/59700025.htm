<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if Medicare payments to HealthCarePlan (HCP) were appropriate for beneficiaries
  reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We determined HCP received Medicare overpayments totaling $27,201 for 31 beneficiaries
  incorrectly classified as institutionalized.&nbsp; The 31 beneficiaries were part of a statistical sample of 100 Medicare
  beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1996.&nbsp; Based on
  our sample results, we estimate that HCP received Medicare overpayments of at least $36,020 for beneficiaries incorrectly
  classified as institutionalized during the audit period.</p>
