<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Federal regulations require that states pursue Aid to Families with Dependent 
  Children (AFDC) overpayments made prior to October 1, 1996, and make appropriate 
  refunds to the Federal Government. This final report points out that, generally, 
  the State of Ohio had systems in place to identify and collect AFDC overpayments 
  but did not refund to the Federal Government its proportionate share of those 
  collections. In accordance with our recommendations the State agreed to refund 
  $17.2 million, and to improve its recovery policies and procedures to ensure 
  timely reporting and refunding of AFDC overpayment recoveries and modify its 
  automated statewide eligibility system to account for AFDC overpayment recoupments.</p>
