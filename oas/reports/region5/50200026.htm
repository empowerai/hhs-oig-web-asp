<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of medical education payments 
  claimed by Clarian Health Partners, Inc. (Clarian) for the period January 1 
  to December 31, 1999. &nbsp;The objective of the review was to determine the 
  accuracy of resident full time equivalent (FTE) counts used by Clarian to calculate 
  direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) 
  payments.&nbsp; We determined that Clarian overstated their resident FTE counts 
  by 87.26 FTEs (51.48 GME and 35.78 IME).&nbsp;&nbsp; This overstatement occurred 
  because Clarian did not compute the FTE counts in accordance with federal regulations.&nbsp; 
  As a result of these errors, Clarian overclaimed reimbursement by a total of 
  $263,884 ($260,161 GME and $3,723 IME).&nbsp; We recommended that Clarian: 1) 
  reduce the FTE counts reported on its FY 1999 Medicare cost report by 51.48 
  for GME and 35.78 for IME, 2) strengthen controls to ensure that future FTE 
  counts are calculated in accordance with Federal requirements, and 3) determine 
  whether the errors identified in our review have occurred in prior Medicare 
  cost reports and coordinate with its fiscal intermediary, AdminaStar Federal, 
  to make any necessary financial adjustments.</p>
