<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this audit 
  was to determine if payments to UnitedHealthcare (United) under Contract H9011 
  were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized.&nbsp; We 
  determined that United received Medicare overpayments totaling $121,023 for 
  127 beneficiaries incorrectly reported as institutionalized during the period 
  January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.&nbsp; Reasons for questioning the 
  institutional status of the beneficiaries included: no documentation of institutional 
  residency, admit or discharge dates during the required 30 day residency period, 
  and issues related to hospital stays.</p>
