<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that the State agency claimed over $5.0 
  million (Federal share) in foster care maintenance payments that were ineligible 
  for Federal sharing. The claims were ineligible primarily because the payments 
  were not supported by a judicial determination containing a statement that reasonable 
  efforts were made to prevent the child's removal from the home or reunite the 
  child with his or her family. In addition to a financial adjustment for the 
  $5.0 million, we recommended that the State agency strengthen its controls to 
  ensure that all Title IV-E payments are made in accordance with Federal requirements. 
  Regional operating division officials concurred with our findings and recommendations.
