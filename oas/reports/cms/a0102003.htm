<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This final report points out that in recent years the Centers 
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has made significant progress managing 
  debt, especially at the Medicare contractors. However, serious problems remain. 
  We identified an estimated $670 million (absolute value) in misstated and misclassified 
  delinquent Medicare debt in information reported to the Treasury Department. 
  Misstatements included $450 million in reconciliation errors, $68 million in 
  unsupported or unrecorded transactions, and $152 million in classification errors 
  regarding the debts eligibility for referral to Treasury for collection. Further, 
  the CMS did not have an adequate process for pursing debt through the issuance 
  of required demand letters. We made specific recommendations for improving supporting 
  documentation, periodic reconciliations, and supervisory review of delinquent 
  debt activities. The CMS concurred with our recommendations.</p>
