<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of fiscal year (FY) 2002 
  Medicare fee-for-service claims.&nbsp; The objective of this review was to estimate 
  the extent of fee-for-service payments that did not comply with Medicare laws 
  and regulations.&nbsp; This is the seventh year that the Office of Inspector 
  General (OIG) has estimated these improper payments.&nbsp; As part of our analysis, 
  we have profiled the last 7 years' results and identified specific trends where 
  appropriate.&nbsp; Based on our statistical sample, we estimate that improper 
  Medicare benefit payments made during FY 2002 totaled $13.3 billion, or about 
  6.3 percent of the $212.7 billion in processed fee-for-service payments reported 
  by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp; These improper 
  payments, as in past years, could range from reimbursement for services provided 
  but inadequately documented to inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and abuse.&nbsp; 
  The FY 2002 estimate of improper payments is significantly less than the $23.2 
  billion that we first estimated for FY 1996.&nbsp; As a rate of error, the current 
  6.3-percent estimate is the same as last year’s rate—which was the lowest to 
  date—and less than half of the 13.8 percent reported for FY 1996. </p>
<p>Since we developed the first error rate for FY 1996, CMS has demonstrated continued 
  vigilance in monitoring the error rate and developing appropriate corrective 
  action plans.&nbsp; For example, CMS has worked with provider groups, such as 
  the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association, to clarify 
  reimbursement rules and to impress upon health care providers the importance 
  of fully documenting services.&nbsp; Such efforts have contributed to the large 
  reduction in the rate.&nbsp; In addition, due to efforts by CMS and the provider 
  community, the overwhelming majority of health care providers follow Medicare 
  reimbursement rules and bill correctly.&nbsp; In this regard, since FY 1998, 
  over 92 percent of Medicare fee-for-service payments have contained no errors.&nbsp; 
  Lastly, fraud and abuse initiatives on the part of CMS, the Congress, the Department 
  of Justice (DOJ), and OIG have had a significant impact.&nbsp; However, continued 
  vigilance is needed to ensure that providers maintain adequate documentation 
  supporting billed services, bill only for services that are medically necessary, 
  and properly code claims.</p>
