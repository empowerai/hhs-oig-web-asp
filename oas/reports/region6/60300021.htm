<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This audit report provides the results of our audit work performed at TrailBlazer Health Enterprises,
  LLC (TrailBlazer) as part of the Office of Inspector General’s nationwide determination of the fiscal year (FY) 2002 Medicare
  error rate.&nbsp; Our audit work at TrailBlazer was limited to: (1) identifying all of the Medicare claims paid during
  the FY 2002 first quarter; (2) verifying the accuracy of Medicare benefit payments and other data reported by TrailBlazer
  to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); and, (3) reviewing, with assistance from the TrailBlazer medical
  staff and the Texas and New Mexico Quality Improvement Organizations, a statistical sample of Medicare beneficiary expenditures
  paid during the first quarter for compliance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; We identified several areas where TrailBlazer
  reported incorrect information to CMS.&nbsp; In addition, we noted improper claims that resulted in net questioned costs
  totaling approximately $93,863.&nbsp; We recommended correction of procedural weaknesses and a financial adjustment for
  the $93,863.</p>
