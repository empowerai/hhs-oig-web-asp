<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the New Mexico Human
  Services Department (NMHSD) had established adequate accountability over the
  Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found that the NMHSD had not established
  adequate controls over the drug rebate program as required by federal rules
  and regulations.&nbsp; Areas that lacked sufficient controls included (1) accounts
  receivable system, (2) segregation of duties, (3) interest accrual and collection,
  (4) dispute resolution, and (5) Form CMS 64.9R reconciliation.&nbsp; As
  a result, there was (1) no reasonable assurance as to the accuracy of the $5.8
  million that NMHSD reported as its outstanding balance as of June 30, 2002,
  (2) a potential risk for waste, fraud, or abuse of the drug rebate program
  funds, and (3) no assurance that NMHSD was collecting all of the interest payments
  for late, unpaid, or disputed rebates. The NMHSD generally agreed with our
  findings and recommendations, except for segregation of duties for the receipt
  of cash.</p>
