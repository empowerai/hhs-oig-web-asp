<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report addresses the audit of the Advanced Payment System (APS) used
  by the Indian Health Service (IHS) to advance cash to its contractors and grantees
  (contractor). Our review identified that APS controls did not ensure that cash
  advances were limited to the immediate needs of IHS contractors. As a result, contractors
  routinely received excess cash. We also found that contractors transferred IHS
  cash from designated bank accounts until it was needed to pay for expenses incurred
  under IHS contracts. As a result, IHS could not accurately account for its cash
  advances by auditing the bank accounts and could not be assured that IHS cash was
  only used to fund IHS activities and programs. Therefore, an important safeguard
  is being bypassed. </p>
