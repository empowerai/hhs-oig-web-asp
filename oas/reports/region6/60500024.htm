<p>Section 303 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 established
  a new methodology for Medicare Part B reimbursement of drugs and biologicals.&nbsp; Section 303 required
  OIG to report to Congress on the adequacy of the reimbursement rates under the new methodology.&nbsp; The
  objective of this review was to determine whether physician practices in the specialties of hematology,
  hematology/oncology, and medical oncology could purchase drugs for the treatment of cancer patients
  at the MMA-established reimbursement rates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We concluded that physician practices in the specialties of hematology, hematology/oncology, and medical
  oncology could generally purchase drugs for the treatment of cancer patients at less than the MMA-established
  reimbursement rates.&nbsp; We based this conclusion on a statistical estimate of average prices paid
  by physician practices for 39 payment codes that constituted more than 94 percent of the $4.5 billion
  in total 2004 Medicare-allowed amounts for drugs associated with these 3 specialties.&nbsp; We also
  based the conclusion on a statistical estimate of the percentage of practice/months for which physician
  practices were able to purchase drugs at less than the reimbursement amount.&nbsp; Overall, we estimated
  that the average prices paid for drugs associated with 35 of the 39 payment codes were less than the
  reimbursement amounts.&nbsp; In addition, we estimated that for at least half of the practice/months,
  the physician practices could purchase the drugs at less than the reimbursement amounts for 35 of the
  39 codes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that Congress consider the results of our review in any deliberations regarding the
  Medicare Part B reimbursement methodology for drugs for the treatment of cancer patients.&nbsp; The
  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services stated that the report provides valuable information about
  the payment adequacy for Part B drugs used in cancer treatment.</p>
