<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process for
  determining Medicare capitation rates under risk based contracts with managed care
  organizations (MCO). At a Texas MCO we identified millions in administrative costs
  that may be considered inappropriate and unallowable if considered in light of
  the Medicare program's general principle of paying only reasonable costs. Examples
  of such costs included unreasonable management fees and reinsurance expenses from
  a related organization, lobbying costs, entertainment, and charitable donations.
  Additional reviews are underway and preliminary results show similar problems at
  other MCOs. The results of these reviews will be shared with the Health Care Health
  Financing Administration in the coming months so that appropriate legislative changes
  can be considered. </p>
