<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides you with the results of our audit of Medicare hospice beneficiary
  eligibility determinations at the Family Hospice of Dallas (FHD) in Dallas, Texas.
  This audit was part of Operation Restore Trust (ORT), a joint initiative among
  various Department of Health and Human Services components. The ORT seeks to identify
  specific vulnerabilities in the Medicare program and pursue ways to reduce Medicare's
  exposure to abusive practices. </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to evaluate hospice eligibility determinations
  for beneficiaries that remained in hospice care for more than 210 days. We also
  determined the amount of payments made to the Family Hospice of Dallas (FHD) for
  those Medicare beneficiaries that did not meet the Medicare reimbursement requirements. </p>
<p>Our review included a medical evaluation of FHD's eligibility determinations for
  60 Medicare beneficiaries who had been in hospice care for more than 210 days.
  Of the 60 cases, 26 were active in hospice at the time of our review and represent
  20 percent of the 133 patients who were active Medicare hospice beneficiaries at
  FHD as of September 7, 1995. The review showed that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20 beneficiaries were not eligible for hospice coverage at the time of admission,
    and<br
    wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li>medical records for 2 other beneficiaries were insufficient to conclusively
    determine a life expectancy of 6 months or less, as required by the Medicare
    program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our medical determinations were made by physicians who were consultants to the
  Texas Medical Foundation, the Texas Peer Review Organization (PRO). As part of
  their initial review, all 22 cases, which were found ineligible or inconclusive,
  have been reviewed by staff from the fiscal intermediary, Palmetto Government Benefits
  Administrators (PGBA). The PGBA agreed with the PRO's decisions. </p>
<p>We believe the identified discrepancies with the 20 beneficiaries occurred due
  to inaccurate prognoses of life expectancy by hospice physicians based on the medical
  evidence in the patients' files. For the two other questionable beneficiaries,
  we believe the evidence in the medical files was not sufficient to permit a determination
  of eligibility. The FHD received Medicare payments for hospice services totaling
  $973,094 for 20 ineligible patients and $69,648 related to the 2 beneficiaries
  for whom we were unable to determine that a terminal illness existed at the time
  of admission to the hospice. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the intermediary: <br wp="br2" />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recover payments of $973,094 for the 20 beneficiaries who were not eligible
    for Medicare hospice benefits. Recover payments made on behalf of ineligible
    beneficiaries after September 7, 1995.<br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li>Conduct medical reviews of the two cases for which we were unable to conclusively
    determine whether the beneficiary was terminally ill. Based on the results of
    these reviews, take appropriate action to recover amounts ($69,648) determined
    to be overpayments.<br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li>Coordinate with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in providing
    training to hospice providers and physicians on eligibility requirements for
    hospice beneficiaries, particularly the requirement for a 6-month prognosis.<br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li>Analyze utilization trends to identify hospices with large increases in claims
    for beneficiaries with over 210 days of hospice coverage and conduct medical
    reviews on a sample of their claims.<br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li>Conduct periodic reviews of hospice claims to ensure the hospices are obtaining
    sufficient medical information to make valid eligibility determinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intermediary responded to a draft of this audit report on November 18, 1996.
  The intermediary officials have reviewed information that we provided and they
  concur with the eligibility determinations made by the PRO physicians. However,
  they stated that they would be reluctant to recover payments. These officials believe
  that the beneficiary would be held liable in these situations and HCFA had instructed
  them to educate providers rather than deny services for the time period in question.
  The intermediary officials stated that hospice data is currently included in the
  intermediary's focused medical review data analysis process and its education department
  regularly conducts education workshops on eligibility requirements for hospice
  providers and physicians. </p>
<p>We will be working with HCFA on the beneficiary liability issue and the recovery
  of overpayments from the hospice. </p>
