<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p> This report provides the results of our review of additional benefits
  reported by Pacificare of Texas (Pacificare), in the Calendar year (CY) 2000 Adjusted
  Community Rate Proposal (ACRP) for the San Antonio, Texas plan.&nbsp; Our review
  showed that the additional benefits estimated in Pacificare’s CY 2000 ACRP were
  available to Medicare beneficiaries at the levels and co-payments priced in the
  ACRP, except for additional chiropractic care services. Pacificare estimated $107,355
  for additional chiropractic services that were not supported or offered to its
  members. PacifiCare agreed with our audit results and stated that it (1) revised
  the ACRP preparation and pricing methodology to ensure that only additional benefits
  available to Medicare beneficiaries are included in the ACRP; (2) examines the
  accounting system and supporting documentation annually to ensure that appropriate
  detail data is available for all material Medicare benefits; and (3) monitors the
  controls for maintaining copies of all provider contracts. </p>
