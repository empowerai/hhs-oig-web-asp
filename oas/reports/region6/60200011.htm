<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report consolidates the results of five State 
  reviews.&nbsp; Objectives were to determine:&nbsp; (1) if the five States were 
  using all Federal funds available to them for the Promoting Safe and Stable 
  Families program, and (2) if the selected States met their cost matching requirements.&nbsp; 
  Our review showed that the five States:&nbsp; (1) did not use $66.5 million 
  or 34 percent of the $197.7 million available for Fiscal Years 1994 through 
  1999, and (2) met the required 25 percent State cost match for the Federal funds 
  expended during each year of participation.&nbsp; The unobligated funds could 
  not be used by other States because the program statute did not provide reallotment 
  authority.&nbsp; During our review, the Administration for Children and Families 
  (ACF) submitted proposed legislation that would provide it with reallotment 
  authority.&nbsp; The proposed legislation was signed into law on December 18, 
  2001.&nbsp; We recommended that ACF:&nbsp; (1) more closely monitor program 
  performance in the States to ensure accurate and timely financial reporting; 
  and (2) establish a mechanism to identify grant funds in sufficient time to 
  allow reallotment for other States' use.&nbsp; The ACF generally agreed with 
  our findings and recommendations.</p>
