<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>We audited the Texas Department of Health’s (Health Department)
    implementation of CARE Act Title II for the grant year April 1, 2001-March 31, 2002, to determine if the Health Department
    (1) met key service delivery performance goals and complied with program requirements; (2) purchased prescription drugs
    at the lowest price available for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP); and (3) followed applicable cost requirements
    in the expenditure of CARE Act Title II funds.&nbsp; The Health Department (1) exceeded its service delivery performance
    goals and complied with program requirements; (2) purchased prescription drugs at the lowest price available for its
    ADAP; and (3) substantially complied with cost requirements in the expenditure of CARE Act Title II funds, although there
    were some areas where the Health Department could improve in terms of oversight and monitoring of sub-recipients.&nbsp; We
    recommended that the Health Department improve its oversight and monitoring of sub-recipients and emphasize compliance
    with all financial and reporting requirements of the CARE Act Title II program.</p>
