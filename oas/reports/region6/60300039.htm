<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly
    reimbursed Deaconess Hospital (hospital) for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services. &nbsp;We determined that the
    hospital met the Medicare cardiac rehabilitation coverage requirements for direct physician supervision.&nbsp; However,
    our claims review of 19 beneficiaries who received outpatient cardiac rehabilitation
    services during CY 2001, we showed that the hospital claimed and received Medicare reimbursement for five beneficiaries&#8217;
    services, amounting to $462, which were not supported by medical record documentation or which were otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We
    attributed these errors to weaknesses in the hospital's internal controls and oversight procedures. We recommended a
    financial adjustment for $462 and that the hospital implement controls related to the billing and documentation of outpatient
    cardiac rehabilitation services.</p>
