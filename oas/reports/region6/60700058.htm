<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the high-dollar Medicare payment that 
Chisholm Administrative Services (Chisholm) made to a provider for an outpatient service was appropriate.&nbsp; The 
high-dollar Medicare outpatient payment was not appropriate. &nbsp;For calendar year 
2005, Chisholm made one payment of $50,000 or more for outpatient services. &nbsp;Our 
analysis indicated that, at the start of our fieldwork in February 2007, the 
payment was incorrect, and the provider had not refunded the $57,700 
overpayment.&nbsp; We notified the provider and requested that the claim be reviewed.&nbsp; 
After reviewing the claim, the provider submitted an adjusted claim and refunded 
the overpayment.&nbsp; The Chisholm medical review team reviewed and approved 
the revised amount. &nbsp;We recommended that Chisholm review the provider’s payment 
history for claims under $50,000 that bill code C9205 and correct any claims 
found in error and use the results of this audit in its provider education 
activities.&nbsp; Chisholm agreed with our recommendations.</p>
