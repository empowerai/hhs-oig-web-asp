<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the State of Texas (State) reported Medicaid provider
  overpayment adjustments and reclaiming adjustments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The
  State did not report 48 overpayment adjustments totaling approximately $1.91 million (approximately
  $1.21 million Federal share) in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; This resulted
  in potentially higher interest expense to the Federal Government of approximately $19,964.&nbsp; The
  untimely overpayment adjustments occurred because the State did not have reconciliation procedures
  in place to verify that all reportable Medicaid provider overpayments were included on its
  CMS-64s [Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program,
  Form CMS-64] within the required timeframe.&nbsp; The State also did not have written policies
  and procedures in place to ensure compliance with Federal requirements related to submitting
  reclaiming adjustments.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) continue its reconciliation
  procedures to ensure that future overpayments are reported timely on the CMS-64s in accordance
  with Federal criteria; and (2) verify that the written policies and procedures that it is
  currently developing ensure that future reclaiming adjustments are reported in accordance
  with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State agreed.</p>
