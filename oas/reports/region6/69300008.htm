<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report notes that 11 State Medicaid programs have policies in place
  that promote the use of generic drugs beyond the current Federal requirements.
  Also, the use of generic drugs was being promoted by other programs that provide
  health benefits. Some programs require generic substitution when generic drugs
  are available, while others use financial incentives as part of their reimbursement
  policy. For just 37 high volume brand name drugs, we estimate annual cost savings
  to the Medicaid program could be as much as $46 million if the reimbursement for
  those drugs is limited to the amounts set by HCFA for equivalent generic drugs.
  The cost savings would become even greater in the future as the Federal patents
  on exclusive drug manufacturing of 60 highly used brand name drugs with more than
  $10 billion in sales expire between now and 1995. </p>
