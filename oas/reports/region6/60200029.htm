<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that from April 1, 1997 through March 31, 2002 
  a total of $2.4 million ($1.6 million Federal Share) in AFDC overpayments had 
  been recovered by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDHS).&nbsp; We 
  recommended that OKDHS refund $1.6 million to the Administration for Children 
  and Families (ACF) in accordance with Federal requirements and that they refund 
  the Federal share of subsequent AFDC recoveries to ACF in the form of a check 
  at least quarterly.&nbsp; The OKDHS concurred.&nbsp; The OKDHS also enclosed 
  a copy of the check written to ACF to refund the $1.6 million in overpayments 
  and a worksheet detailing its calculations.&nbsp; The OKDHS stated it will calculate 
  the same for future periods, refund the Federal share on a quarterly basis and 
  adjust any Federal reports.</p>
