<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This report points out that Texas has an opportunity to increase enrollment in the State Children&#8217;s
  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and have noncustodial parents pay a portion of the associated costs.&nbsp; Based on a
  statistical sample, we estimated that 114,708 children would have been eligible to receive SCHIP benefits from June 1,
  2001 through May 31, 2002.&nbsp; The noncustodial parents of 81,198 of these children could potentially contribute $39.7
  million toward the $65.1 million in costs that would have been incurred if the children had been enrolled.&nbsp; We also
  determined that 22,793 Title IV-D children received SCHIP benefits during the audit period.&nbsp; An estimated 14,288 of
  these children had noncustodial parents who could potentially contribute $5.0 million toward the $6.5 million in SCHIP
  premiums paid on behalf of their children.&nbsp; We recommended that Texas take appropriate steps to recover SCHIP costs
from noncustodial parents with medical support orders and the ability to pay for their dependent children.</p>
