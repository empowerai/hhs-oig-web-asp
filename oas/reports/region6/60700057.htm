<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The objective of this review was to determine whether 
Pinnacle Business Solutions, Inc.’s (Pinnacle) high-dollar Medicare payments to 
Arkansas Part A providers for inpatient and outpatient services were 
appropriate.&nbsp; Of the eight high-dollar inpatient payments and one 
high-dollar outpatient payment that Pinnacle made to providers, one inpatient 
payment was appropriate. &nbsp;However, Pinnacle overpaid providers $79,037 for six 
inpatient claims and $257,862 for one outpatient claim.&nbsp; We were not able 
to determine the error amount for one inpatient claim because it had not been 
adjusted by the end of our fieldwork.&nbsp; We recommended that Pinnacle ensure 
that the $336,899 in overpayments have been recovered, follow up with the 
provider on the one claim that had not been adjusted, use the results of this 
audit in its provider education activities, and identify and recover any 
additional overpayments made for high-dollar Part A inpatient claims paid after 
calendar year 2003.&nbsp; Pinnacle agreed with the findings and recommendations.</P></BODY></HTML>
