<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of the Indian Health Service's
  (IHS) Tribal Management Grants Program (program). We performed this review at the
  request of IHS management. The program, authorized by the Indian Self-Determination
  and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, as amended, is intended to be
  a source of funds to assist American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and tribal
  organizations (tribes) assess whether they want to provide health care services
  under contracts with IHS (this is in contrast to tribes receiving direct health
  care from IHS facilities). The grants, which average about $81,000 are used mainly
  to improve the management capacity of the tribes or tribal organizations, and to
  aid in planning and evaluation. In Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, about one-third of IHS'
  $1.36 billion budget was awarded in contracts to tribes so they could provide their
  own health care services. </p>
<p>Our overall objective was to evaluate the success of the Tribal Management Grants
  Program. Our specific sub-objectives were to determine whether (1) the application
  review process was effective in finding those projects consistent with the program
  objectives; (2) IHS project officers provided needed program support to the tribes;
  and (3) IHS evaluated those projects funded to ascertain the overall success of
  the program. </p>
<p>Our review identified areas where improvements could be made to the Tribal Management
  Grants Program, specifically regarding the effectiveness of the application review
  process and the project officers' support provided to the tribes. However, because
  there were no agreed-upon measurement criteria, we found that the overall performance
  of the program could not be objectively measured. </p>
<p>Regarding our specific sub-objectives, we determined: <br wp="br2" />
</p>
<dl>
  <dd><strong>Finding 1:</strong> The application review process needs to be improved.
    Although IHS had established review criteria, reviewers did not apply criteria
    consistently. A consistent evaluation would ensure, for example, that all reviewers
    applied the same criteria in judging the applications.<br wp="br1" />
        <br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Many project officers did not provide tribes support
    in applying for or carrying out their grants because they did not view their
    role in this program as important.<br wp="br1" />
        <br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd><strong>Finding 3:</strong> The IHS did not make an adequate evaluation of
    the program's performance. Because IHS did not have agreed upon criteria for
    the program, nor established goals to measure program success, IHS has not been
    able to evaluate the program's performance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We also found differing interpretations of the program among and between the three
  groups we surveyed--tribes, reviewers, and project officers. Such variance appeared
  to be linked to IHS not clearly defining and communicating the purpose of the program
  to all affected parties. </p>
<p>Our findings led us to conclude that there is no assurance that the most qualified
  projects were selected for funding; or that the funded projects received sufficient
  program support to succeed. Further, because a system has not been developed to
  measure project and program achievements, there is no assurance that the program
  is accomplishing what was intended under the law. </p>
<p>To ensure that the program is administered fairly and provides the maximum benefit
  to the tribes, we suggest that IHS: (1) revise its application review process to
  ensure that all applications are reviewed consistently; (2) emphasize to project
  officers the importance of providing needed support to the tribes and delineate
  relevant tasks in their performance plans; (3) develop program performance criteria;
  (4) implement a system to measure program accomplishments; and (5) clearly define
  and communicate to the tribes, reviewers, and project officers the purpose of the
  program. </p>
<p>In its October 3, 1996 comments to our draft report, IHS indicated agreement with
  our findings and suggested several technical changes which we have incorporated. </p>
