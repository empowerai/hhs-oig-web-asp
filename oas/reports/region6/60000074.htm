<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that, for the period September 1, 1997 through August
  31, 2000, the State Agency improperly claimed FFP of $424,838 for institutions
  for mental disease residents between the ages of 21 to 64 who were temporarily
  released from State hospitals to general acute care hospitals for medical treatment.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the State Agency: &nbsp; (1) refund $424,838 to the Federal Government
  for FFP improperly claimed; (2) cease claiming FFP for clients between the ages
  of 22 to 64 and those aged 21 at admission when these clients are temporarily released
  from State hospitals to general acute care hospitals for medical treatment; and
  (3) develop controls or edits within its Medicaid Management Information System
  to detect and prevent claims for FFP for clients between the ages of 22 to 64 and
  for those aged 21 at admission who are temporarily released from State hospitals
  to general acute care hospitals for medical treatment.&nbsp; The State Agency agreed
  with our recommendations.</p>
