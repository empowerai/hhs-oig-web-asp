<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if controls were in place to 
  effectively preclude the Texas Department of Health (TDH) from claiming Federal 
  financial participation (FFP) under the Medicaid program for 21 to 64 year old 
  residents of State operated psychiatric hospitals that are institutions for 
  mental diseases (IMDs).&nbsp; We found that for the period September 1, 1997 
  through August 31, 2000, TDH improperly claimed FFP for medical and ancillary 
  services for IMD clients between the ages of 22 to 64, and for those aged 21 
  at admission. As a result, FFP totaling $462,551 was improperly claimed at the 
  nine State hospitals included in our audit. While State officials stated that 
  it would recover payments for the claims that were improperly paid, our review 
  focused on the improper claiming of FFP by the State Medicaid agency, not on 
  inappropriate payments received by providers. Therefore, the improperly claimed 
  FFP associated with this audit, as well as any identified subsequently, should 
  be refunded to the Federal Government irrespective of whether or not payments 
  are recouped from providers. </p>
