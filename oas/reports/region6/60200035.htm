<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services (CMS) Region VI Regional Office (1) accurately reported
  and properly supported its accounts receivable balances including a &#8220;settlement
  cleanup&#8221; project involving certain Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) accounts
  receivable for the quarter ended September 30, 2000, and (2) complied with
  the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and CMS policies related to collection
  efforts.&nbsp; The lack of adequate, or in some instances, any reconciliation
  and internal control procedures prevented the Regional Office from (1) accurately
  reporting its accounts receivable and the MSP &#8220;settlement cleanup&#8221; amount
  and (2) timely referring delinquent accounts receivable to the Treasury.&nbsp; Before
  the completion of our fieldwork, the Regional Office developed and implemented
  policies and procedures that addressed the concerns identified during our fieldwork.
  In addition, subsequent to the completion of our fieldwork, CMS issued instructions
  for the Regional Office to transfer the administration of Medicare accounts
  receivable debt to the originating contractors.&nbsp; As a result, our only
  recommendation was for the Regional Office to continue to process and report
  Medicare accounts receivable in accordance with its current policies and procedures
  through its final reporting period of September 30, 2003.&nbsp; The Regional
  Office fully concurred with our findings and recommendation.</p>
