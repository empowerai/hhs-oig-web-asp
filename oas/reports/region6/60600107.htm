<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether the 
services on rehabilitation claims paid to Avante At Leesburg (Avante) of 
Leesburg, Florida, were medically necessary, properly billed, and adequately 
supported by medical documentation. &nbsp;A complete medical review of the 100 claims 
sampled showed that 20 included medically unnecessary or improperly billed 
skilled services.&nbsp; As a result, we estimated that 
Medicare overpaid Avante at least $708,086 for services that did not meet 
Medicare requirements.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that Avante (1) refund to the Medicare 
program $708,086 in overpayments, (2) ensure that future claims with skilled 
services comply with Medicare requirements on medical necessity, (3) establish 
adequate controls to ensure that the correct claims are adjusted, and (4) work 
with its fiscal intermediary to determine the amount of overpayments made 
subsequent to our audit period and refund the overpayments to the Medicare 
program.&nbsp; Avante disagreed with the medical 
reviewers’ determination that 30 Resource Utlization Groups be denied or downcoded.&nbsp; However, we 
relied on the knowledge and expertise of the medical reviewers; therefore, we 
stand by the findings and recommendations.</p>
