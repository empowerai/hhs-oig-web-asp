<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of six ulcer treatment drugs
  reimbursed under the Illinois Medicaid prescription drug program. The Omnibus Budget
  Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) requires the State Medicaid agencies to operate
  drug use review programs on an ongoing basis. One of the standards recognized by
  OBRA '90 is the manufacturers' recommended dosages. We concluded that the Illinois
  Department of Public Aid (State agency) did not have any restrictions pertaining
  to the manufacturers' recommended dosages for ulcer treatment drugs. Accordingly,
  our review showed that about $5.82 million (Federal share $2.91 million) in cost
  savings could have been realized for Calendar Year 1990 had the State agency limited
  payment for these drugs to the amount needed to pay for the manufacturers' recommended
  dosages.</p>
