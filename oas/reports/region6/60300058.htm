<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our overall objective was to determine if the Texas Department of Health (Department of Health) has adequate procedures
  in place to record, summarize and report Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program (Program) costs in accordance with
  the approved cooperative agreements.&nbsp; We found that the Department of Health (1) generally accounted for program funds
  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement except that it did not segregate expenditures
  by phase, within a phase, or by priority planning area; (2) did not supplant current State or local expenditures with program
  funds; and (3) had adequate procedures in place to monitor sub-recipient activities.&nbsp;  We
  recommended procedural corrections with which the Department of Health concurred.</p>
