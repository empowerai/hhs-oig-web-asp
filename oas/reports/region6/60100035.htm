<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>States are required to pursue and recover overpayments made prior to October
  1, 1996 under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and
  return the Federal share to the Federal Government. Reviews in three States
  (Texas, Louisiana, and Illinois) showed the States had systems to identify
  and collect AFDC overpayments but did not refund to the Federal Government
  its proportionate share of those collections. The three States owed a total
  of $31 million (Texas $14 million, Louisiana $1 million and Illinois $16 million).
  In response to our recommendations, Louisiana and Illinois agreed to refund
  their shares. Texas did not, citing what it called contradictory guidelines
  from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). However, the regulations
  are clear on what was required of the States. The ACF should pursue collection
  of the $14 million from Texas.</p>
