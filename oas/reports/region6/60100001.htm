<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Most States use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount, which
  varies by State, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions.&nbsp; Therefore,
  the objective of this review was to develop for the Texas Medicaid program an estimate
  of the discount below AWP at which pharmacies purchase brand name and generic drugs.&nbsp; In
  Texas, our estimate of the overall discount below AWP for the invoice prices reviewed
  was 22.17 percent for brand name drugs and 62.84 percent for generic drugs.&nbsp; Our
  national estimates, included in reports previously issued, were 21.84 percent and
  65.93 percent, respectively.&nbsp; We recommended that the Texas Health and Human
  Services Commission consider the results of this review as a factor in any future
  changes to pharmacy reimbursement for Medicaid drugs.&nbsp; The State Agency stated
  that they planned to use the data along with their own invoice survey in determining
  changes to pharmacy reimbursement.</p>
