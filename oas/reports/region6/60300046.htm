<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether (1) administrative costs that the Oklahoma Department of
  Human Services (the State agency) claimed were allowable, reasonable, and allocable for reimbursement
  under the Medicaid program and (2) targeted case management costs charged as administrative costs were
  allowable.&nbsp; Of the $26,451,655 in administrative costs that the State agency claimed during our
  audit period, $3,589,374 ($1,799,193 Federal share) was not allowable, reasonable, or allocable for
  Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency inappropriately charged $79.5 million ($39.75
  million Federal share) in targeted case management costs as administrative costs, despite receiving
  separate reimbursement as a direct Medicaid service. While the State agency recognized these errors
  and periodically made adjustments to offset the costs inappropriately charged, it still needed to make
  offsets totaling $18,153,178 ($9,076,589 Federal share).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made several recommendations with regard to administrative costs, including that the State agency
  (1) refund $1,799,193 to the Federal Government and (2) discontinue claiming university indirect costs
  that it does not pay, as well as lawsuit settlement costs, and ensure that future administrative cost
  claims are made for allowable costs only.&nbsp; With regard to targeted case management costs, we recommended
  that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government the $9,076,589 Federal share that it received
  for targeted case management costs charged as administrative costs and (2) discontinue claiming targeted
  case management costs as administrative costs.&nbsp; The State agency did not contest our findings
  on cost adjustment errors or miscellaneous overcharges and indicated that it had already taken corrective
  action regarding targeted case management costs. However, the State agency disputed the draft report
  findings and conclusions concerning administrative costs pertaining to university indirect costs and
  lawsuit settlement costs.</p>
