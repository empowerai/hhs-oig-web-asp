<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our latest work in determining whether the
  Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) control system detects incorrectly
  reported transfers in Medicare's Part A prospective payment system (PPS). This
  work follows up on a prior HCFA and Office of Inspector General (OIG) joint recovery
  project. In that project the OIG identified incorrectly reported PPS transfers
  through November 1991, which resulted in approximately $227 million of recoveries
  and savings. Our new work has found that intermediaries continue to make payments
  for incorrectly reported transfers. The OIG identified another 43,012 incorrectly
  reported transfers and approximately $127.3 million of potential overpayments for
  the 3-year period ended December 31, 1994. </p>
<p>Our work to date indicates that the PPS transfer edit does detect incorrectly
  reported PPS transfers; however, fiscal intermediaries may not be processing these
  transfers according to HCFA's instructions. We are continuing our audit work to
  fully identify the cause(s) for incorrectly reported PPS discharges not being adjusted
  to transfers. </p>
<p>We are recommending that HCFA: (1) advise all intermediaries that the PPS transfer
  instructions must be followed when processing future transactions, (2) assist us
  in identifying the cause(s) of this problem, and (3) cooperate with the Department
  of Justice (DOJ) efforts to recoup past overpayments. The DOJ has informed us that
  it will assume responsibility for the recovery of overpayments related to incorrectly
  reported and paid PPS transfers occurring between January 1, 1992 and December
  31, 1995, as part of its fraud investigation under the Civil False Claims Act.
  (We are in the process of obtaining the data for 1995 and will transmit it to DOJ
  when available.) Thus, HCFA should not recover incorrectly reported and paid PPS
  transfers occurring prior to January 1, 1996 under its usual procedures. </p>
<p>The HCFA Administrator responded to our draft report in a memorandum dated September
  3, 1996. The HCFA agreed with our recommendations and will issue instructions to
  all intermediaries requiring them to utilize the edit to correctly process claims
  involving PPS transfers. The HCFA also agreed that it should assist the OIG in
  identifying the causes of this problem and that it should cooperate with the DOJ
  in its recovery efforts. The HCFA also included technical comments which we considered
  in finalizing this report. </p>
