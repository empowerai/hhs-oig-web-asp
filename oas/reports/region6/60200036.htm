<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service 
  claims paid in Louisiana for beneficiaries identified as incarcerated during 
  the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with 
  Federal regulations and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.&nbsp; 
  Louisiana was 1 of 10 states selected as part of a nationwide review requested 
  by the Senate Finance Committee.&nbsp; We found that our random sample of 100 
  claims included 75 allowable claims, 18 unallowable claims and 7 claims for 
  which the allowability of the claim could not be determined.&nbsp; The CMS plans 
  to establish an edit in its Common Working File (CWF) that will deny claims 
  for incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; We believe the planned edit will prevent 
  many improper payments for claims of incarcerated beneficiaries. However, we 
  believe CMS and its contractors will need to educate suppliers and providers 
  on the proper use of the modifier or condition code. Also, claims with the modifier 
  or condition code must be monitored to assure the conditions under regulations 
  at 42 CFR 411.4 (b) required for payment are, indeed, being met.&nbsp; CMS regional 
  officials agreed with the findings and recommendations.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/bottom.lbi" -->
