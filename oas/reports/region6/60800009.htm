<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">East&nbsp;Jefferson General Hospital’s (the hospital) expenses 
for the first 5 months of 2005 and the first 5 months of 2007 presented in its 
congressional testimony were generally accurate and supported by its financial 
records.&nbsp; However, the hospital’s revenue as described in the testimony for the 
first 5 months of 2007 did not include $4&nbsp;million in a Medicare Wage 
Stabilization grant it received during this period.&nbsp; The Louisiana Hospital 
Association removed this amount when compiling the testimony data and referenced 
the grant amount in an explanatory note.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We conducted this review at the request of the House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, before which the hospital testified at a hearing on August 1, 2007.<br>
<br>
The hospital agreed with the results of our review.&nbsp; This was an informational 
report, and we had no recommendations.</p>
