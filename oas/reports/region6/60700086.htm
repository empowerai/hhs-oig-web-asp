<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether 
Pinnacle Business Solutions, Inc.’s (Pinnacle) high-dollar Medicare payments to 
Missouri Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp; Of the 59 high-dollar payments that 
Pinnacle made to providers, 46 were appropriate. However, Pinnacle overpaid 
providers $65,506 for the remaining 13 payments.&nbsp; Providers stated that they had 
refunded two of the overpayments, totaling $17,643, prior to our fieldwork; 
however, Pinnacle had not received the refund for one claim with an overpayment 
totaling $14,440.&nbsp; Eleven overpayments, totaling $47,863, remained outstanding.&nbsp; We recommended that Pinnacle recover the $47,863 in overpayments identified 
during our audit, process the corrected claim and recover the $14,440 
overpayment that the provider stated that it had corrected prior to our audit 
but Pinnacle had not received, review for accuracy claims that had a charged 
amount equal to the allowed amount, and consider using the results of this audit 
in its provider education activities.&nbsp; Pinnacle agreed with the findings and 
recommendations.</p>
