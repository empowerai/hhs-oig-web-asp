<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This audit was made by the Texas State Auditor' Office (SAO), with staff assistance
  from the Office of Inspector General, as part of the Inspector General's partnership
  efforts with States to expand audit coverage of foster care programs. The SAO report
  identifies some serious gaps in the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory
  Services' (TDPRS) oversight of foster care contractors which could undermine TDPRS'
  efforts to ensure the safety of children in its care, and ensure that contractors
  provide the expected services and comply with contract requirements. Other problems
  noted included; (1) the foster care rate methodology was based upon a number of
  untested assumptions, (2) the TDPRS lacks adequate assurance about the accuracy
  of cost reports submitted by foster care providers, and (3) the TDPRS has not implemented
  policies and procedures to verify that child placing agencies are paying their
  foster homes the required minimum amount of maintenance payment. The TDPRS agreed
  with the SAO's findings and has begun taking action to correct the weaknesses identified
  in its administration of foster care contracts. </p>
