<p>This is one of a series of reports on Medicare+Choice organizations’ use of the
  additional funding provided by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA).&nbsp; Our
  objectives were to determine whether Humana (1) supported the $7.8 million of additional capitation
  payments and used the funds in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements and (2) supported the $6.6
  million cost increase that was not related to the BIPA funding increase.&nbsp; Of the $7.8 million
  BIPA capitation payment increase in Humana’s revised proposal, $2.6 million was properly supported
  and was used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; However, the remaining $5.2 million
  was unsupported; therefore, we could not determine whether it was used in a manner consistent with
  BIPA requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, of the $6.6 million increase in direct medical care costs that
  was not related to the BIPA funding increase, $1.3 million was supported.&nbsp; The remaining $5.3
  million was unsupported.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that Humana:&nbsp; (1) work with CMS to determine how much of the $5.2
  million BIPA capitation payment increase was used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements and
  refund any amount not used in such a manner, (2) work with CMS to determine what remedies are needed
  to address the $5.3 million of unsupported increases unrelated to the BIPA funding increase, and (3)
  ensure that estimated costs in future proposals are properly supported.&nbsp; In response to our report,
  Humana did not directly address our recommendations but did provide additional documentation.</p>
