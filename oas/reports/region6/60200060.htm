<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Under Part C (Medicare+Choice) of the Medicare Program, Medicare+Choice organizations
  (MCOs) are responsible for providing all Medicare-covered services, except hospice care, in return for a predetermined
  capitated payment.&nbsp; MCOs with plans for which payment rates increased were required to submit a revised proposal to
  show how they would use the increase during 2001.&nbsp; MCOs were required to use the additional amounts to reduce beneficiary
  premiums or cost-sharing, enhance benefits, contribute to a stabilization fund for benefits in future years, or stabilize
  or enhance beneficiary access to providers.</p>
<p>PacifiCare submitted a revised proposal that reflected an increase in Medicare
  capitation payments of about $16.4 million for 2001.&nbsp; We found that about $5.2 million of the $16.4 million increase
  in PacifiCare's revised proposal was not used in a required manner or was not supported.&nbsp; Approximately $4.2 million
  was not associated with stabilizing or enhancing access to providers because PacifiCare did not renegotiate its provider
  contracts to increase provider payment rates as indicated in its revised proposal.&nbsp; A $1 million medical cost contingency
  did not comply with requirements and was unsupported.&nbsp; We recommended that PacifiCare refund $5,204,042 to the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services or, as an alternative, deposit this amount in a benefit stabilization fund for use in
  future years.&nbsp; We also recommended that PacifiCare ensure that estimated costs in future proposals are properly supported.</p>
