<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p> This report provides the results of our audit of Medicaid payments made by 
  the Texas Department of Human Services (TDHS) under the State of Texas Access 
  Reform Plus (STAR+PLUS) managed care program. The objectives of our review were 
  to determine whether STAR+PLUS members were eligible for managed care and assigned 
  to the appropriate risk group for payment purposes, and whether any unallowable 
  Medicaid payments were made in the fee-for-service sector for services provided 
  under the managed care program. Our review disclosed that TDHS made risk group 
  assignment errors for eligible STAR+PLUS members during fiscal year 2000. As 
  a result, an overpayment of $40,070 was made to HMOs participating in the STAR+PLUS 
  program. We did not identify the impact these payment errors had on the total 
  population of Medicare members totaling about 49,500 for FY 2000. However, for 
  FYs 1998 and 1999, TDHS' internal audit identified an overpayment totaling $387,214 
  and an underpayment totaling $1,102,399. We are recommending that the Commission 
  ensure that TDHS: (1) makes the appropriate adjustments for the $387,214 overpayment 
  and $1,102,399 underpayment; (2) recoups the $40,070 related to the payment 
  errors; (3) makes the necessary adjustments to the related Federal Financial 
  Participation (FFP) amount; (4) corrects the payment system problems; and (5) 
  reports to us the impact of these problems on the 49,500 members enrolled during 
  FY 2000. The Commission agreed with our recommendations and has taken action 
  to recover overpayments and correct payment system problems. </p>
