<p> <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> <br />
  <br />
  Most States use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount,
  which varies by State, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions.&nbsp; Therefore,
  the objective of this review was to develop for the Florida Medicaid program
  an estimate of the discount below AWP at which pharmacies purchase brand name
  and generic drugs.&nbsp; Our estimate of the overall discount below AWP for
  the invoice prices we reviewed was 22.88 percent for brand name drugs and 68.19
  percent for generic drugs.&nbsp; Our national estimates, included in reports
  we previously issued, were 21.84 percent and 65.93 percent, respectively.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration consider
  the results of our review as a factor in any future changes to pharmacy reimbursement
  for Medicaid drugs.</p>
