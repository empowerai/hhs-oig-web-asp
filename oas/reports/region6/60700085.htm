<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether 
Pinnacle Business Solutions, Inc.’s (Pinnacle) high-dollar Medicare payments to 
Louisiana Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp; Twenty-nine of the thirty 
high-dollar payments that Pinnacle made to providers were appropriate.&nbsp; However, 
Pinnacle overpaid one provider $19,641 for the remaining payment.&nbsp; We 
recommended that Pinnacle recover the $19,641 overpayment and consider using the 
results of this audit in its provider education activities.&nbsp; Pinnacle 
agreed with the finding and recommendations.</p>
