<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>>Our audit objective was to determine
    whether 72 paid Medicare claims for outpatient stent placement services provided in calendar year
    2002 were reasonable, necessary, and allowable under Medicare rules; supported by adequate documentation;
    and properly coded. &nbsp;The Program Safeguard Contractor found that a total of 20 claims from 15
    providers did not meet Medicare reimbursement of requirements and, as a result, were overpaid by
    a total of $35,291.&nbsp; These errors may have occurred because the providers did not have procedures
    in place to ensure that the services for which they billed met Medicare requirements.&nbsp; In addition,
    the providers may need additional education covering proper billing practices for stent services.&nbsp; We
    recommended that TrailBlazer recover the $35,291 in overpayments and provide education to these providers
    to ensure that the claims they submit for reimbursement meet Medicare’s requirements. &nbsp;TrailBlazer
    generally agreed with our findings and recommendations, stating that it had recovered the overpayments
    based on our recommendations.</p>
