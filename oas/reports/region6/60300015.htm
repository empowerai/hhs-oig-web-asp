<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Albuquerque Manor, a New Mexico nursing home, claimed costs
    on its Medicaid cost report for the year ended December 31, 2000 that were not:&nbsp; (1) related to patient care or
    supported, (2) reduced to costs for related party transactions, and (3) allocable to the Manor.&nbsp; New Mexico’s Medicaid
    program requires costs to be related to patient care and cost information to be accurate, current, and in sufficient
    detail to support payments for services rendered.&nbsp; It also requires that purchases from related organizations not
    exceed the cost to the related organization and that costs must be based on an approved cost finding method.&nbsp; The
    conditions occurred because the Manor did not have policies, procedures, and controls to ensure compliance with the State’s
    Medicaid program requirements.&nbsp; As a result, the Manor’s Medicaid cost report was overstated by $518,492.&nbsp; We
    recommended that the Manor: (1) establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure program requirements are met,
    and (2) submit a revised cost report that reduces costs by the amounts questioned, which will be used by the State Medicaid
    program to re-compute and adjust Medicaid reimbursement payments.&nbsp; The Manor did not fully agree with the recommended
adjustment and was not responsive to the conditions in our report.</p>
