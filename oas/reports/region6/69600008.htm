<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report presents the results of the certified public accounting firm of Doshi &amp; Associates'
  audit of costs claimed on Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield's (ABCBS) final administrative
  cost proposals (FACP). The audit covered Medicare Parts A and B of the Arkansas
  program and Part B of the Louisiana program for fiscal years 1989 through 1994.
  We have performed sufficient work to satisfy ourselves that the attached audit
  report can be relied upon and used by the Health Care Financing Administration
  in meeting its program oversight responsibilities. </p>
<p>We are recommending a financial adjustment of $1,442,193 because ABCBS:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>understated the complimentary credits from its private insurance business due
    Medicare by $834,586. These credits arise from medical information contained
    in the Medicare claim and used in processing a claim from the private line of
    business;<br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd>did not credit Medicare with $118,373 for its share of interest earned on an
    Health Maintenance Organization reserve balance for employee health insurance;<br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd>charged Medicare $67,648 for funding a general contingency reserve for a Preferred
    Provider Organization as part of its employee health insurance plan. Such contingencies
    are unallowable per the Federal Acquisition Regulations;<br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd>allocated $228,396 in excess executive compensation costs to Medicare during
    fiscal years 1991 through 1994. ABCBS increased its executive compensation an
    average of 34 percent for the period as compared to the Bureau of Labor Statistics'
    average increase of 14 percent for the same period;<br wp="br2" />
  </dd>
  <dd>allocated other miscellaneous unallowable costs totaling $58,762 to Medicare.
    These included bank account fees - $27,469, annual reports - $23,885, legal fees
    - $3,690, State licenses for insurance sales agents - $1,844, telephone line
    charges - $1,344, and social activities - $530.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In order to avoid exceeding approved budgets, ABCBS did not claim $5,121,476 in
  incurred Medicare costs for fiscal years 1993 and 1994. We offset a portion of
  the unclaimed costs against questioned costs. We made the offset because ABCBS
  had originally claimed the detailed costs on its FACP'S, and then eliminated them
  because they exceeded budget ceilings. As a result, the unclaimed costs were identifiable
  and auditable. We did not, however, offset the remainder of unclaimed costs against
  questioned costs because they were not specifically identified. </p>
<p>In its response, ABCBS agreed with $1,213,797 of the questioned costs, and disagreed
  with the findings on employee health insurance and executive compensation costs.</p>
