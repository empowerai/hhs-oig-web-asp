<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to review the requirements for, and manner in which, manufacturers determine
  (average manufacturer prices) AMPs under section 1927 of Social Security&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; Existing
  requirements for determining certain aspects of AMPs are not clear and comprehensive, and
  manufacturers’ methods of calculating AMPs are inconsistent.&nbsp; Our discussions with industry
  groups confirmed the need to clarify requirements and raised additional issues related to
  the implementation of DRA provisions.</p>
<p>We recommended that the Secretary direct CMS, in promulgating the AMP regulation, to: (1)
  clarify requirements in regard to the definition of retail class of trade and the treatment
  of pharmacy benefit manager rebates and Medicaid sales; and, (2) consider addressing issues
  raised by industry groups, such as: (a) administrative and service fees, (b) lagged price
  concessions and returned goods, (c) the frequency of AMP reporting, (d) AMP restatements,
  and (e) baseline AMP.&nbsp; We also recommend that the Secretary direct CMS to: (1) issue
  guidance in the near future that specifically addresses the implementation of the AMP-related
  reimbursement provisions of the DRA and (2) encourage States to analyze the relationship
  between AMP and pharmacy acquisition cost before using AMP for their reimbursement methodology.</p>
