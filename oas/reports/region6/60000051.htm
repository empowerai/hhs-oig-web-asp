<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that of $28.6 million of allocable expenses reported
  in Rehability Health Services&#146; (RHS) Fiscal Year 1998 Medicare cost report,
  $18.4 million was questioned primarily because RHS did not provide documentation
  to support costs claimed, and certain clinic extension sites were not Medicare
  certified to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, a material
  portion of the $5.5 million in Medicare payments to RHS for FY 1998 was not reimbursable.
  We are providing Mutual of Omaha, the fiscal intermediary for RHS, with the necessary
  information so it can apply the appropriate adjustments to RHS&#146; cost report,
  recompute the costs of provider services, and determine the overpayment amount
  for final settlement of the cost report. However, RHS voluntarily withdrew from
  participation in the Medicare program, and along with its parent corporation, has
  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
