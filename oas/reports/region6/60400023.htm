<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Shiprock Hospital had completed the credentialing, privileging, and
  personnel suitability reviews for its medical practitioners (practitioners).&nbsp; Shiprock Hospital did not routinely
  complete required credentialing, privileging, or personnel suitability reviews for its practitioners.&nbsp; Shiprock Hospital
  did not routinely complete required credentialing, privileging, or personnel suitability reviews for its practitioners.&nbsp; For
  the 84 practitioners we reviewed, Shiprock Hospital did not (1) verify the credentials for 32, or 38 percent, before the
  practitioners provided patient care; (2) ensure that 67, or 80 percent, had current privileges, with lapsed period ranging
  from 3 days to over 3 years; or (3) request the Office of Personnel Management to perform a background investigation of
  41, or 49 percent.&nbsp; As a result, the hospital's management could not assert full assurance that its practitioners
  had the appropriate qualifications, authorizations, and personnel history to provide patient care.&nbsp; Among other things,
  we recommended that IHS ensure that Shiprock Hospital has a sufficient number of staff assigned to adequacy perform the
  credentialing and privileging processes before the practitioners provide patient care, has fully implement credentialing
  and privileging computer software to track and monitor the status of its practitioners, and reports privileging problems
  and associated corrective actions to the Joint Commission, as appropriate.</p>
