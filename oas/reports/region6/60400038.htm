<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p> The objective of this audit was to determine whether Clinton Hospital had completed the credentialing and privileging
  reviews for its medical practitioners.&nbsp; For 23 practitioners we reviewed, the hospital did not verify the credentials
  for 7, or 30 percent, to determine their current competence; or ensure that 17, or 74 percent, had current privileges,
  with lapsed periods raging from 2 days to 34 months.&nbsp; Clinton Hospital's management had not ensured that the credentialing
  and privileging review processes received the necessary level of priority in terms of management attention and other resources.&nbsp; As
  a result, the hospital's management could not assert its full assurance that its practitioners had the appropriate qualifications
  and authorizations to provide patient care.&nbsp; We recommended that the Indian Health Service (IHS) ensure that Clinton
  Hospital's management establishes a system to routinely perform credentialing and privileging reviews.&nbsp; The IHS stated
  that all recommended corrective actions had been taken.</p>
