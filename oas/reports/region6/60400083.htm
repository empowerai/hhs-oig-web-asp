<p>This report provides the results of the OIG’s review of amounts paid to two Texas physicians, who
  were reimbursed more than $150 per claim for care plan oversight (CPO) services provided during the
  2-year period ended December 31, 2002.&nbsp; Our audit objective was to determine if the amounts paid
  for CPO services met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Two Texas physicians billed and were
  improperly paid $15,897 for 236 CPO services on 9 CPO claims.&nbsp; None of the 236 services met Medicare
  reimbursement requirements because the physicians (1) did not provide 230 of the services and (2) did
  not have supporting documentation for the remaining 6 services.&nbsp; In addition, when TrailBlazer,
  the Medicare carrier for the State of Texas, paid these CPO claims, it did not have claim-processing
  system edits in place to ensure that only one service was billed on each claim.&nbsp; Since then, TrailBlazer
  has implemented such edits to reduce two or more billed CPO services to one service on each claim.&nbsp; After
  these edits were in place, we did not identify any additional overpayments for excessive CPO services
  during our audit period.</p>
<p>We recommended that TrailBlazer (1) recover the $15,897 of overpayments made to the two physicians
  for physician CPO services improperly billed to Medicare; (2) review physician CPO service claims paid
  after our audit period to ensure that its claim-processing system edits have continued to prevent improper
  payments for excessive CPO services; and (3) continue its efforts to provide physicians with education
  covering Medicare’s requirements for billing and documenting CPO services.&nbsp; TrailBlazer agreed
  with our findings and recommendations.</p>
