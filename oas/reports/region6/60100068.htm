<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Arkansas&#146; 
  Department of Human Services, Division of Children and Family Services&#146; 
  (DCFS) participation in Title IV-B, Subpart 2 Promoting Safe and Stable Families 
  Program in fiscal years (FY) 1994 through 1999.&nbsp; The objectives of our 
  review were to determine: (1) the reasons why DCFS did not use all Federal funds 
  for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program and (2) if DCFS met its cost 
  sharing requirements. The DCFS did not use $3,658,873 in grant awards from FYs 
  1994 through 1999. This occurred because DCFS did not take full advantage of 
  the funding available in FY 1994 for planning and developing its Promoting Safe 
  and Stable Families Program. The DCFS did not spend any grant funds available 
  at the inception of the program. Instead it was not until the second year of 
  the 2-year grant before any funds were spent. This pattern of not spending funds 
  until the second year of the 2-year grant period has continued and currently 
  still exists. The DCFS officials explained that a combination of factors made 
  administering the program difficult and contributed to the State&#146;s spending 
  patterns and resulting unobligated balances. These factors included operating 
  with an outdated accounting system, difficulty contracting and procuring services, 
  and the disbanding of the Family Preservation Unit. Based on the information 
  provided by DCFS officials, DCFS met its required 25 percent State cost match 
  for FYs 1994 through 1999.</p>
