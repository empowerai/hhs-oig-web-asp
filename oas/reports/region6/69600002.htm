<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report presents the results of our review of Arkansas Department of Human
  Services' (State agency) reimbursement for clinical laboratory services under the
  Medicaid program. The objective of our review was to determine the adequacy of
  procedures and controls over the processing of Medicaid payments to providers for
  clinical laboratory tests. Our review was limited to clinical laboratory services
  involving chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests. </p>
<p>The State agency allowed excessive reimbursements for (1) chemistry and urinalysis
  tests that should have been bundled into a panel for payment and (2) duplicate
  payments of hematology and urinalysis tests. Controls were not effective in detecting
  unallowable claims for laboratory tests that should have been claimed as one test
  and duplicated claims. The State agency did not have procedures or controls in
  place in its claims processing system that would identify and reject these types
  of overpayments. </p>
<p>We randomly selected 150 claims with potential payment errors from a population
  of calendar years (Cys) 1993 and 1994 paid claims valued at $497,625. Of the 150
  sampled items, 105 were overpaid. Each represented a potential payment error in
  which the State agency paid a provider for clinical laboratory tests on an individual
  test basis instead of as part of a group, or were duplicative of each other. Projecting
  the results of our statistical sample over the population using standard statistical
  methods, we estimate that the State agency overpaid providers $167,162 for chemistry,
  hematology and urinalysis tests. At the 90 percent confidence level, the precision
  of this estimate is plus or minus 28.74 percent. </p>
