<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that Medicare paid 1,610 hospitals 
  an additional $6.8 million because the hospitals reported patients as having 
  left against medical advice (called LAMA discharges), when, in actuality, the 
  patients were transferred or admitted to another hospital on the same day. As 
  a result, these claims were paid at an amount higher than would have been paid 
  had the LAMA discharges been treated as transfers. This problem occurred because 
  LAMA discharges are not included in the computerized system edits designed to 
  detect same day discharge and readmission to another hospital. In addition to 
  the recovery of overpayments, we recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
  Medicaid Services (CMS):&nbsp; (1) review the instructions for incorrect hospital 
  coding of patient discharges in order to determine whether it should be revised 
  to address transfers reported as LAMA discharges; and (2) develop adequate internal 
  controls and monitoring safeguards at the fiscal intermediaries and peer review 
  organizations to detect and address transfers reported as LAMA discharges.</p>
