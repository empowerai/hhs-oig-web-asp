<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to assess whether additional benefits proposed
  in NYLCare's Contract Year (CY) 2000 adjusted community rate proposal (ACRP)
  were available to Medicare beneficiaries at reasonable costs and as advertised,
  and that these benefits were both credible and properly valued.&nbsp; We found
  that, during 2000, NYLCare provided additional benefits as proposed in its
  CY 2000 ACRP and as advertised in its marketing brochures.&nbsp; We also found
  that NYLCare&nbsp; provided prescription drugs to Medicare enrollees at reduced
  rates by taking advantage of discounts negotiated with independent pharmacies
  that dispensed the prescription drugs.&nbsp; However, our review disclosed
  problems with the prescription drug benefit component on NYLCare's CY 2000
  ACRP that impacted both the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the plan, as
  well as NYLCare itself.</p>
