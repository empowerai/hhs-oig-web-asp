<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report points out that over a 3-year period at least $2.7 million (Federal
  share $1.7 million) was improperly retained by 9 child placing agencies in Texas
  for unallowable services under the Title IV-E Foster Care program. The retained
  funds were used for such services as costs of operations, case management, therapy,
  counseling, respite care, psychiatrists, training, transportation, day care assistance,
  and administrative costs. These costs do not meet the definition of maintenance
  payments and therefore are not allowable charges to the Title IV-E Foster Care
  program. In addition to financial adjustments, we are recommending that the State
  agency institute controls to ensure that child placement agencies pay the full
  maintenance to the foster homes. </p>
