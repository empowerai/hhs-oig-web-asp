<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report estimates, based on a statistical sample, that at least
  $1,098,553 in outpatient psychiatric services claimed by Tomball Regional Hospital
  did not meet Medicare reimbursement criteria. Specifically, charges for outpatient
  psychiatric services were not reasonable and necessary, or were provided to beneficiaries
  who were not eligible for such services. We noted an additional $219,114 for unallowable
  occupational therapy charges related to the above claims. Finally, we identified
  $45,059 in unallowable patient transportation costs, and were unable to determine
  the reasonableness of an additional $818,429 because the Hospital could not provide
  supporting documentation. In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended
  that the Hospital strengthen its procedures to ensure that charges for outpatient
  psychiatric services are covered and properly documented in accordance with Medicare
  requirements. We also recommended that the Hospital establish an effective procedure
  for excluding costs related to noncovered services from its Medicare cost reports. </p>
