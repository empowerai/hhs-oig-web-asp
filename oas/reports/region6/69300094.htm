<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report points out that Humana, Inc. corporate headquarters had
  improperly reported to the Medicare program a portion of the employee health care
  fringe benefit costs for all of its hospitals for the 3 fiscal years ended August
  31, 1990. A fiscal intermediary for Humana, Inc. (AdminaStar) working with other
  Medicare FIs having responsibility for the approximately 80 Humana hospitals identified
  overcharges totaling about $92.9 million for employee benefits/group health insurance.
  AdminaStar also found that patient charges for this same period were overstated
  by approximately $90 million. The FIs are adjusting individual hospital's cost
  reports. We are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
  monitor the resolution of these adjustments to ensure that appropriate recoveries
  are made. We are also recommending that HCFA reemphasize the need for all FIs to
  carefully review whether hospitals or hospital chains are properly reporting employee
  health care benefit costs in situations where the services are directly rendered
  by the provider or a related organization. The HCFA concurred with our findings
  and recommendations. </p>
