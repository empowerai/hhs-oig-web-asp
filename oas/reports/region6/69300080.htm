<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that the Indian Health Service (IHS) had not established
  the controls necessary to ensure that amounts billed to private health insurance
  companies for medical services were accurate and covered all allowable services.
  As a result, we estimate that IHS underbilled private insurers by $7.3 million
  for the 3-month period ending March 31, 1993. In addition, the IHS did not contact
  private health insurance companies or otherwise follow up on an estimated $1.2
  million of unpaid claims. To maximize collections, we recommended that the IHS
  establish the necessary internal controls, assign adequate resources to its business
  offices, provide additional training to business office staff to ensure that claims
  for all covered services are filed and accurate, and implement complete and timely
  follow-up procedures. The Public Health Service concurred with our findings and
  recommendations. </p>
