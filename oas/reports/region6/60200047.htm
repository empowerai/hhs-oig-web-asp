<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p >The objective of our audit was to determine whether the Texas Health and Human Services
  Commission (the State agency) claimed Federal reimbursement for school-based health services
  in accordance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; We found that 991 of sampled claims
  did not comply with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; The State agency claimed reimbursement
  for services that were (1) not allowable because of programmatic deficiencies or (2) rendered
  by unlicensed providers.&nbsp; We estimate that the State agency inappropriately claimed
  at least $8,749,158 in Federal reimbursement during State fiscal year 2000.&nbsp; In addition,
  school districts were overpaid $53,235 for counseling services because they were paid more
  than the maximum allowable fee established by the State agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Federal Government $8,749,158
  for unallowable services, (2) work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
  to determine the financial impact to the Federal Government for overpayments made by the
  State agency for counseling services and make an appropriate refund, (3) review periods after
  our audit period and make appropriate financial adjustments for any unallowable services,
  (4) routinely monitor claims from school districts for compliance with Federal and State
  requirements, (5) direct school districts to ensure that providers of services meet licensing
  requirements, and (6) issue guidance requiring school districts to bill only for allowable
  Medicaid services rendered by licensed individuals.&nbsp; State agency officials said that
  they would need to complete a number of steps before addressing most recommendations.</p>
