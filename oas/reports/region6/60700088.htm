<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether 
Pinnacle Business Solutions, Inc.’s (Pinnacle) high-dollar Medicare payments to 
Oklahoma Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp; Of the 160 high-dollar payments 
that Pinnacle made to providers, 149 were appropriate.&nbsp; However, Pinnacle 
overpaid providers $104,608 for the remaining 11 claims.&nbsp; One provider refunded 
an overpayment, totaling $17,042, prior to our fieldwork.&nbsp; Another provider 
refunded an overpayment, totaling $34,938, during our fieldwork.&nbsp; Nine 
overpayments, totaling $53,723, and one underpayment, totaling $1,094, remained 
outstanding.&nbsp; We recommended that Pinnacle recover the $53,723 in overpayments, 
refund the $1,094 underpayment, review all 2003 claims with Healthcare Common 
Procedure Coding System code Q0187 to determine whether the correct drug price 
was used to calculate the reimbursement, review for accuracy claims that had a 
charged amount equal to the allowed amount, and consider using the results of 
this audit in its provider education activities.&nbsp; Pinnacle agreed with the 
findings and recommendations.</p></BODY></HTML>
