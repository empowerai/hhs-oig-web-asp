<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory
  Services (TDPRS) was unable to ensure that child placing agencies and their foster
  homes were meeting required standards, and that State case workers were monitoring
  the status of children while they were in the care of these homes. For example,
  in 18 cases the child placing agency case workers did not contact the children
  quarterly nor visit the foster home quarterly as required, in 28 cases there was
  no record showing that a background check was make on all adults who lived in the
  foster home, in 40 cases at least one fire and/or health deficiency was noted,
  and in 71 cases State case workers did not have the required contact with the foster
  children. Recommendations call for actions the TDPRS can take to assure the adequacy
  of performance by child placing agencies, foster homes, and State case workers. </p>
