<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This limited scope audit was made to gain an understanding of TrailBlazer’s policies
  and procedures related to its accounts receivable operations and, where applicable,
  to provide TrailBlazer with written policies and procedures for its consideration
  in making changes and improvements to such operations.&nbsp; At the outset of our
  fieldwork, TrailBlazer did not have adequate written policies and procedures in
  place or did not always follow existing policies and procedures.&nbsp; However,
  during and subsequent to the completion of our fieldwork, TrailBlazer provided
  us with both written policies and procedures and verbal explanations of the corrective
  actions taken to address the concerns identified during our fieldwork.&nbsp; The
  recommendations included in our report provided for further improvements or clarifications
  of TrailBlazer’s policies and procedures related to the areas of concern.&nbsp; TrailBlazer
  officials generally concurred with these recommendations.</p>
