<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Santa Fe Indian Hospital (Santa Fe) complied with applicable requirements to secure and account for its Schedule II substances.</p>
<p>Santa Fe complied with applicable requirements to secure its Schedule II substances.&nbsp;However, Santa Fe did not institute all recommended security precautions or have adequate internal controls over these substances at its outpatient and inpatient pharmacies.&nbsp;In addition, Santa Fe did not always comply with applicable requirements to account for Schedule II substances at its outpatient pharmacy and automated dispensing units in the outpatient department and inpatient ward.&nbsp;As a result, Schedule II substances at Santa Fe were vulnerable to theft and mismanagement.</p>
<p>We recommend that IHS direct Santa Fe to enforce the security, internal, and accountability controls detailed in our report.</p>
<p>IHS concurred with our findings and recommendations and stated that Santa Fe had implemented, or was currently implementing, all recommended corrective actions.</p>
