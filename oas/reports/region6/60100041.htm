<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This report points out that the Texas Medicaid state plan, with regard to calculating 
  disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment limits, did not comply with the 
  intent of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993. The state made 
  payments to hospitals on a progressive basis, but did not have controls in place 
  to assure that payments did not exceed the actual costs of providing services 
  to patients, which we believe was the intent of the OBRA of 1993. As a result, 
  DSH payments totaling approximately $511.4 million ($319.2 million federal share) 
  were paid to Texas hospitals in excess of hospital specific limits for hospital 
  fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Among other things, we recommended that Texas 
  work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to address and resolve 
  the $511.4 million ($319.2 million federal share) of DSH payments in excess 
  of hospital specific limits.</p>
