<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">The objective of this review 
was to determine whether therapy services provided by a Texas physical therapist 
during calendar year 2002 met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; None of 
the sampled claims met Medicare’s reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; In total, 
688 of the 702 services documented in 97 claims did not meet one or more of 
Medicare’s reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; The physical therapist did not have 
a thorough understanding of Medicare requirements and did not have effective 
policies and procedures to ensure that he billed Medicare only for services that 
met Medicare requirements.&nbsp; As a result, the physical therapist improperly 
billed Medicare and received $12,652 for the 688 services.<br>
<br>
We 
recommended that the physical therapist refund to the Medicare program $281,325 
in unallowable payments for therapy services provided in 2002 and develop 
quality control procedures to ensure that therapy services are provided and 
documented in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements. The physical 
therapist did not agree with our findings and recommendations.</p>
