<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the period July 2, 2002, through May 31, 2003, Medicare 
overpaid Heartland Health Care (Heartland) $158,000 for 47 claims (out of 50 
claims totaling $260,000) for skilled services that were not (1) medically 
necessary at the level provided in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and/or at 
the Resource Utilization Group (RUG) level claimed or (2) adequately supported 
by medical documentation.&nbsp; Medicare pays SNFs a daily rate to cover skilled 
services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.&nbsp; For billing purposes, SNFs 
complete an assessment form that places a patient in a specific payment group, 
known as a RUG, based on the patient’s care and resource needs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Heartland refund to the Medicare 
program $158,000 in overpayments and provide training to its staff on SNF 
medical necessity and documentation requirements.&nbsp; Heartland disagreed with our 
findings and took issue with many aspects of the review.&nbsp; However, we relied on 
the knowledge and expertise of medical reviewers from a Medicare program 
safeguard contractor; therefore, we stand by the findings and recommendations.</p>
