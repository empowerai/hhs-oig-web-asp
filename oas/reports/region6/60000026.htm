<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Medicaid provides that States make additional payments (called disproportionate
  share hospital [DSH] payments) to hospitals for the uncompensated costs of serving
  disproportionate numbers of low-income patients with special needs. This final
  report points out that in the State&#146;s 1998 fiscal year Louisiana&#146;s DSH
  payments to nine hospitals exceeded uncompensated costs by approximately $22.2
  million. Also, we could not express an opinion on the allowability of $4.2 million
  of claimed overhead costs because we could not determine the reasonableness of
  the methodology used to calculate the costs. In addition to financial adjustments,
  we recommended implementation of controls to assure DSH payments are determined
  accurately in the future. Auditee officials generally concurred, and agreed to
  implement the recommendations contained in our report.</p>
