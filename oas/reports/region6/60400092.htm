<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our audit objective was to determine whether 28 paid Medicare claims processed by Mutual
  of Omaha (Mutual) in Texas for outpatient stent-placement services provided in calendar year
  2002 were:&nbsp; (1) reasonable, necessary, and allowable under Medicare rules; and (2) properly
  coded.&nbsp;&nbsp;We found that a total of 2 claims from 2 providers were overpaid by a total
  of $4,109.&nbsp; These errors may have occurred because the providers did not have procedures
  in place to ensure that the services for which they billed met Medicare requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  recommended that Mutual recover the $4,109 of overpayments and provide education to these
  providers to ensure that the claims they submit for reimbursement meet Medicare’s requirements.&nbsp; Mutual
  generally agreed with our findings and recommendations, but did not agree that one of the
  Healthcare Common Procedure Codes should be denied.</p>
