<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether New Mexico has systems 
  and procedures to:&nbsp; (1) properly identify, collect and report Aid to Families 
  with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayment recoveries, and (2) refund the correct 
  amount of AFDC overpayment recoveries to the Federal Government.&nbsp; State 
  agencies are required to pursue AFDC overpayments made prior to October 1, 1996 
  and make appropriate refunds to the Federal Government.&nbsp; Collections of 
  overpayments occurring after that date are to be used to offset Temporary Assistance 
  to Needy Families expenditures in the year collected.&nbsp; Generally, the state 
  has systems that identify, collect and report overpayment recoveries.&nbsp; 
  However, these systems did not separately identify&nbsp; recoveries of AFDC 
  overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, the state did not refund to the Federal Government 
  its proportionate share of those collections.&nbsp; We recommended recovery 
  of approximately $3.4 million.&nbsp; State officials concurred with our recommendations.</p>
