<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether New Mexico obtained required approval from the Centers for
  Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) before increasing the personal needs allowance for institutionalized
  residents between July 1, 2000, and September 30, 2004.&nbsp; From July 1, 2000, through September
  30, 2004, the New Mexico Human Services Department (the State agency) increased the monthly personal
  needs allowance annually; however, it did not obtain approval from CMS to increase the allowance for
  the period July 1, 2001 through September 30, 2004. &nbsp;As a result of the unapproved increases,
  the Federal Medicaid program made $391,651 in additional payments to institutionalized residents.&nbsp; We
  recommended the State agency (1) reimburse the Federal government $391,651 and (2) ensure it submits
  a State plan amendment when making Medicaid program changes, such as increasing the personal needs
  allowance for institutionalized individuals.&nbsp; The State agency stated that our report was accurate
  and our recommendations were reasonable.</p>
