<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Most States use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount,
  which varies by State, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions.&nbsp; Therefore,
  the objective of this review was to develop for the Montana Medicaid program
  an estimate of the discount below AWP at which pharmacies purchase brand name
  and generic drugs.&nbsp; Our estimate of the overall discount below AWP for
  the invoice prices we reviewed was 19.71 percent for brand name drugs and 65.37
  percent for generic drugs. Our national estimates, included in reports we previously
  issued, were 21.84 percent and 65.93 percent, respectively.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (State Agency)
  consider the results of our review as a factor in any future changes to pharmacy
  reimbursement for Medicaid drugs.&nbsp; The State Agency stated that they would
  consider the results in any future changes to their pharmacy reimbursement.</p>
