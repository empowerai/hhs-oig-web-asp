<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






Our objective was to determine whether 
the supplemental payment by the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services 
(the State) to the </a>University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (the 
University) for provider services was in accordance with the approved State plan 
and was adequately supported. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Although the formula used to calculate the 
supplemental payment was generally in accordance with the State plan, the 
supplemental payment was not adequately supported.&nbsp; Specifically, the average 
commercial payment rate included noncommercial charges and duplicate commercial 
charges and did not include some disallowances.&nbsp; Additionally, the Medicaid 
charges and payments used to determine the supplemental payment included 
ineligible charges and payments.&nbsp; As a result, the University overstated the 
average commercial payment rate, and the State overstated Medicaid charges and 
understated Medicaid payments.&nbsp; 
<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) to address the 
weaknesses noted in the report related to the calculation of the supplemental 
payment, which may require amending the State plan.&nbsp; We also recommended that 
any change in the average commercial payment rate be applied to the correct 
Medicaid charges and payments for the audit period and that any excess payment 
be refunded to the Federal Government.&nbsp; The 
State reported that it was in negotiations with CMS regarding the supplemental 
payment.
