<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000080">Of the 38 payments of $200,000 
or more (high-dollar payments)</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #000080">
</span><span style="color: #000080">that TriSpan Health Services (TriSpan) made 
to providers for calendar year 2003, 18 were appropriate. &nbsp;However, TriSpan 
incorrectly paid providers for 20 claims.&nbsp; For 17 of the 20 claims, providers 
submitted revised claims that resulted in net overpayments totaling $155,990. 
&nbsp;For the remaining three claims, providers agreed that they had submitted 
incorrect claims and said that they would submit revised claims.&nbsp; TriSpan is a 
Medicare Part A intermediary serving more than 1,800 Medicare providers in 
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri.</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #000080">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="CM19"><span style="color: #000080">We recommended that TriSpan (1)
</span><font color="#000080">ensure that identified overpayments have been 
recovered, (2) follow up with the providers about the three claims that have not 
been revised, (3) use the results of this audit in its provider education 
activities, and (4) consider identifying and recovering any additional 
overpayments made for high-dollar Part A inpatient claims paid after calendar 
year 2003. &nbsp;TriSpan agreed with our recommendations.</font></p>
