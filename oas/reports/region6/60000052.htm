<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process for
  determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed care
  organizations (MCO). At a Texas-based MCO we found that $10 million of administrative
  costs reported as Medicare base year costs would have been considered unallowable
  under Medicare's general principle of paying only reasonable costs, as is the case
  with cost-based MCOs. If held to such criteria, administrative costs reported in
  the MCO's 2000 ACR would have been reduced by $13.9 million based on the MCO's
  projected Medicare enrollment level. In our report we point out these flaws in
  the current methodology which results in Medicare covering a disproportionate share
  of the MCO's administrative costs. Additional reviews are ongoing and preliminary
  results show similar problems at other MCOs. The results of these reviews are being
  shared with the Health Care Financing Administration so that appropriate legislative
  changes can be considered. </p>
