<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services
  (the State agency) reported overpayments collected by contractors in accordance with Federal
  requirements.&nbsp; The State agency did not report overpayments collected by contractors
  in accordance with Federal requirements during the period October 1, 2000, through April
  30, 2005.&nbsp; Specifically, the State agency did not report $3,657,402 ($2,732,897 Federal
  share) in overpayments and did not report $6,575,449 ($4,858,415 Federal share) in overpayments
  in a timely manner.&nbsp; Also, the State agency did not report the did not report Federal
  share of any interest earned on funds held in the cash holding account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency:&nbsp; (1) include the $3,657,402 in unreported overpayments
  on the CMS-64 and refund the $2,732,897 Federal share; (2) determine the Federal share of
  any interest earned on the $10.2 million that was held, or still may be held, in the cash
  holding account and refund that amount on the CMS-64; and (3) adhere to its written procedures
  for clearing cash holding accounts to ensure that all future overpayments are reported in
  accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our recommendations.</p>
