<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">As part of its relief operations in response to Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita, HHS contracted with CareFlite to arrange transportation for 
all returning evacuees requiring en route medical care.&nbsp; OIG’s review found that 
$3,661,154 of the $5,708,508 that CareFlite billed to HHS was allowable.&nbsp; The 
remaining $2,047,354 did not fully comply with the contract terms because 
CareFlite did not always arrange the most economical transportation or the 
transportation mode selected by discharge planners and documented on patient 
medical necessity forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-weight: normal">OIG recommended that CareFlite (1) work with 
the HHS contracting officer to determine the allowability of the $1,978,513 in 
costs billed without having determined the most economical transportation, (2) 
ensure that future transports are arranged in the most economical fashion, (3) 
refund $68,841 to HHS for the excess costs resulting from arranging transports 
at a higher level of care than was medically necessary, and (4) ensure that 
future transports are arranged using the transportation modes indicated on the 
medical necessity forms.&nbsp; CareFlite disagreed with these recommendations.</span></p>
