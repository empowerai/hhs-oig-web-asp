<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Department of Human
  Services (DHS) had established adequate accountability over the Medicaid drug
  rebate program.&nbsp; We found that the DHS generally had established adequate
  controls over the drug rebate program as required by federal rules and regulations.
  However, we identified one area where the DHS could improve accountability
  over drug rebates.&nbsp; Specifically, the DHS could improve its accounting
  for interest payments received from drug manufacturers.&nbsp; The DHS recorded
  interest payments in the Rebate Management System without a corresponding entry
  to establish the interest as a receivable.&nbsp; In addition, the DHS did not
  verify that interest payments were accurate.&nbsp; As a result, the balance
  of uncollected rebates was understated by $537,979 (the amount of interest
  received) and the DHS cannot be assured that all interest due was paid.&nbsp; The
  DHS agreed with our findings.</p>
