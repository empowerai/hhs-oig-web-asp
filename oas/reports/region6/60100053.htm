<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that significant savings could be realized on 
  generic prescription drugs reimbursed by States under the Medicaid program. 
  Most States use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount as 
  a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions. This discount averaged 
  about 10.31 percent nationally in 1999. We believe it is not a sufficient discount 
  to ensure that reasonable prices are paid for drugs. Our review of pricing information 
  from 217 pharmacies in 8 States estimated that pharmacy actual acquisition cost 
  nationwide for generic drugs averaged 65.93 percent below AWP. For the 200 generic 
  drugs with the greatest amount of Medicaid reimbursement in 1999 we calculated 
  that as much as $470 million could have been saved if reimbursement had been 
  based on a 65.93 percent average discount from AWP. Our review was limited to 
  ingredient acquisition costs and did not address other areas such as the cost 
  of dispensing the drugs. Generally, States pay retail pharmacies for their dispensing 
  action separately from the reimbursement for the prescription drug. We recommended 
  that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) require the States 
  to bring pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs more in line with the actual 
  acquisition cost of such drugs. The CMS concurred and plans to share our final 
  report with the States, strongly encourage States to review their estimates 
  of acquisition costs, and follow-up to ensure that their actions take our findings 
  into account.</p>
