<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Louisiana Department
  of Health and Hospitals (DHH) had established adequate accountability over
  the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found that the DHH had established
  adequate accountability except for (1) the reconciliation of the outstanding
  balance of drug rebate accounts receivable reported on the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services (CMS) 64.9R report to the supporting books and records,
  and (2) the utilization of the hearing mechanism available under the Medicaid
  program to resolve disputes with drug manufacturers as prescribed in the rebate
  agreement between the CMS and the manufacturer(s). &nbsp;As a result of not
  reconciling the CMS 64.9R to the supporting books and records, DHH overstated
  its Medicaid drug rebates accounts receivables as of June 30, 2002 by $33.8
  million.&nbsp; Also, the DHH’s records showed $2.9 million in uncollected drug
  rebates from 1991 through 1995.&nbsp; The DHH agreed with our finding that
  the CMS 64.9R was not reconciled to the supporting books and records and implemented
  a requirement to perform this reconciliation.&nbsp; The DHH disagreed that
  the use of hearings were warranted for the $2.9 million, because its analysis
  indicated that these balances were related to rate changes rather than disputes.</p>
