<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The amount of Medicare reimbursement for services provided a beneficiary enrolled
  in a health maintenance organization (HMO) depends, in part, on the beneficiary's
  county of residence. This final report points out that the Health Care Financing
  Administration (HCFA) made incorrect payments to a HMO chain (which had nine different
  Medicare HMO contracts in effect) on behalf of beneficiaries who were reported
  living out of the HMO's service areas. Specifically, for the two months reviewed,
  our statistical sample showed payments were incorrect or inconclusive for 158 of
  200 beneficiaries (79 percent) who were reported living out-of-area. The effect
  of the address changes with regard to what the monthly Medicare payments should
  have been showed a net underpayment to the HMO of $47,619. The HCFA generally concurred
  with our recommendations specifying actions HCFA should take to preclude this problem
  in the future. </p>
