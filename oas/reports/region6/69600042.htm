<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This review of the Medicaid Expenditures for Durable Medical Equipment in Montana
  for the period from July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1995 was conducted by the Montana
  Legislative Auditor (MLA) as part of our partnership efforts with State Auditors
  to expand coverage of the Medicaid program. We provided the MLA with copies of
  the Office of Inspector General audit reports on this subject and technical assistance
  during the course of the audit. We also performed a desk review of the MLA's audit
  report to satisfy ourselves that the report can be relied upon and used by the
  Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in meeting its program oversight responsibilities. </p>
<p>The MLA performed a limited scope review of the Montana Medicaid expenditures
  for medical equipment and supplies. The Medicaid program is administered by the
  Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department). The objectives of
  the review were to (1) determine whether the Department pays more than necessary
  for medical equipment and supplies and (2) identify procedures to achieve cost
  savings for the Department in the acquisition of medical equipment and supplies. </p>
<p>The MLA's report on the purchasing and payment procedures discussed areas of potential
  cost savings and recommended that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Department evaluate competitive bidding for term contracts for oxygen concentrators
    to reduce costs. The MLA estimated if the Department purchased concentrators
    using the General Services Administration contract pricing and the Veterans Administration
    maintenance contract pricing, the annual cost savings could be between $336,000
    and $504,000 annually.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The Department require a written description and/or prior authorization of
    all Medicaid items paid from invoices billed under miscellaneous equipment identification
    codes. The MLA identified $134,091 in questionable or unallowable Medicaid costs
    paid to providers who billed for equipment using a miscellaneous equipment identification
    code.<br />
  </li>
  <li>The Department work with the Department of Administration to evaluate whether
    the current State term contract for diapers could be modified and/or expanded
    to achieve Medicaid cost savings. The MLA estimates potential annual savings
    of $24,332 through the use of a term contract.<br />
  </li>
  <li>The Department define allowable incontinence supplies and document the medical
    necessity of these supplies including disposable wipes.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to share this report with other States to encourage their participation
  in our partnership efforts. </p>
