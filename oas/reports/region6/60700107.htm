<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">We conducted this review at the request of 33 Senators. <br>
<br>
Medicare Part D payments, excluding dispensing fees, to local, community 
pharmacies exceeded the pharmacies’ drug acquisition costs by an estimated 18.1 
percent when the analysis included rebates that drug wholesalers paid to 
pharmacies.&nbsp; Excluding rebates, Part D payments exceeded drug acquisition costs 
by an estimated 17.3 percent.&nbsp; The estimated difference between Part D payments 
and drug acquisition costs was $9.13 per prescription including rebates and 
$8.78 excluding rebates.<br>
<br>
The estimated average Medicare Part D dispensing fee paid to local, community 
pharmacies was $2.27 per prescription, about $2 less than the average Medicaid 
dispensing fee.&nbsp; We recommended that Congress and CMS consider the results of 
our review, including the data provided, in any deliberations regarding Medicare 
Part D reimbursement.&nbsp; CMS concurred with the recommendation.</p>
