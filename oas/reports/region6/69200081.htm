<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This follow-up final report presents the results of our review of the actions
  taken regarding the relationship between the Hansen's Disease Foundation (Foundation)
  and the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center (Center). Our prior report disclosed
  that: (1) Center employees did not seek and receive approval for engaging in outside
  activities as required under the Department of Health and Human Service's Standards
  of Conduct; and (2) the Center absorbed the costs of research that should have
  been charged to the Foundation. We concluded that the Public Health Service (PHS)
  satisfactorily implemented the recommendations concerning the Center employees
  awareness of and compliance to the Department's Standards of Conduct regarding
  outside activities, and the establishment of procedures to ensure that future costs
  incurred by the Center as a result of Foundation activities are identified and
  reimbursed. However, the recommendation concerning the disposition of the recovered
  funds has not been fully resolved but both parties have agreed upon costs reimbursement
  totaling $164,727.66. </p>
