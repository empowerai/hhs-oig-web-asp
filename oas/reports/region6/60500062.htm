<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The objectives of 
our review <span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal">were to 
determine whether Public Sector Partners (PSP) complied with Federal 
requirements to (1) </span></span>ensure that beneficiaries did not exceed their 
transitional assistance (TA) limits, (2) apply TA funds only to covered drugs, (3) <span class="address">
<span style="font-weight: normal">pass on negotiated prices to beneficiaries and 
offer </span></span>the lower of the negotiated prices or the usual and 
customary prices, and (4) support the expenditures and withdrawals it reported 
to CMS.&nbsp; PSP properly supported the expenditures it made on behalf of 
beneficiaries and the withdrawals from the Payment Management System.&nbsp; However, 
PSP did not have proper procedures in place to ensure that it always complied 
with Federal requirements to ensure that beneficiaries did not exceed their TA 
fund limits, apply TA funds only to covered drugs, and pass on negotiated prices 
to beneficiaries and charge the lower of the negotiated prices or the usual and 
customary prices.&nbsp; As a result, CMS overpaid PSP $420,875 &nbsp;for beneficiaries who 
exceeded their TA limits and $231,260 for excluded drugs for the period July 12, 
2004, through May 31, 2005.&nbsp; In its written comments on our draft report, PSP 
agreed that errors had occurred, but it did not agree with all of the causes we 
identified.&nbsp; PSP stated that it had worked with CMS to correct its 
procedures and had reimbursed CMS for the errors we identified.</span></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended that PSP:&nbsp; (1) 
reimburse CMS for the $420,870; (2) determine whether the amount PSP reimbursed 
CMS for excluded drugs included any of the $231,620 identified in the audit and 
reimburse the difference; and (3) implement policies and procedures, if it 
continues as a prescription drug plan sponsor to ensure that it (a) does not pay 
for statutorily excluded drugs with CMS funds and (b) offers negotiated prices 
to beneficiaries.</span></p>
