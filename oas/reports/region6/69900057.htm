<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that Rehability Health Services (RHS) claimed payment
  for outpatient rehabilitation services that did not meet Medicare eligibility and
  reimbursement requirements. Specifically, the fiscal intermediary's medical review
  personnel identified claims for outpatient rehabilitation services which were not
  reasonable and necessary, authorized by a physician or supported by medical records.
  In many cases RSH could not locate any medical records for a claim. As a result,
  we estimate, based on a statistical sample, that at least $3.1 million was paid
  to RHS for improper charges for Fiscal Year (FY) 1998. We recommended that the
  fiscal intermediary apply the appropriate financial adjustment during settlement
  of RHS' FY 1998 cost report. However, the RHS is no longer a going concern and
  along with its parent corporation has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. </p>
