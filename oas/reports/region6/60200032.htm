<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This audit provides the results of our audit work performed at Arkansas Blue 
  Cross and Blue Shield (Arkansas BCBS) as part of the Office of Inspector General's 
  (OIG) nationwide determination of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 Medicare error rate.&nbsp; 
  Arkansas BCBS was selected by the OIG through statistical sampling as one of 
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contractors to be audited 
  as part of the FY 2001 nationwide audit.&nbsp; The audit period covered the 
  third quarter of FY 2001 (April 1, 2001 through June 30, 2001).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our audit work disclosed three areas where Arkansas BCBS could improve its 
  operations.&nbsp; These areas centered on the reconciliation requirements of 
  both the CMS 1521 and CMS 1522.&nbsp; In addition, the medical review of the 
  788 claims selected in our statistical sample identified 65 claims that did 
  not comply with Medicare laws and regulations, resulting in net questioned costs 
  totaling $9,654.91 that needs to be refunded to Medicare.&nbsp; We recommended 
  that Arkansas BCBS perform a monthly reconciliation of the funds expended as 
  reported on the CMS 1522 to the Medicare paid claims history file; and take 
  the steps needed to ensure that adjustments are made to those claims in our 
  sample that contained errors and that the net adjustment amount of $9,654.91 
  is refunded to Medicare.&nbsp; Arkansas BCBS officials agreed with our recommendations.&nbsp;</p>
