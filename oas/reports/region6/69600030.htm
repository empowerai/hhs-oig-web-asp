<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit on the consolidated results of our
  review of pharmacy acquisition costs for brand name drugs reimbursed under the
  Medicaid prescription drug program. The report is in response to a request from
  the Medicaid Bureau that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) perform an audit
  of the use of average wholesale price (AWP) as part of the Medicaid drug reimbursement
  policies. The request stated that it would be useful for the OIG to document the
  size of the difference between AWP and actual invoice prices paid by retail pharmacies
  to purchase drugs. Most States use AWP, minus a percentage discount which varies
  by State, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions. Although
  this discount is most commonly about 10 percent nationally, it has been recognized
  as not being a sufficient discount to ensure that the reasonable price is paid
  for drugs. Therefore, the objective of our review was to develop an estimate of
  the discount below AWP at which pharmacies purchase brand name drugs. Estimates
  were also developed for the discount below AWP at which pharmacies purchase generic
  drugs and those results will be summarized in a separate report. </p>
<p>Through use of statistical sampling, we obtained pricing information from 315
  pharmacies in 11 States and obtained 18,973 invoice prices for brand name drug
  products. We estimated that actual acquisition cost was a national average of 18.3
  percent below AWP. This estimate combined the results for four categories of pharmacies
  including rural-chain, rural-independent, urban-chain, and urban-independent and
  excluded the results obtained from non-traditional pharmacies. Using the results
  of our review, we calculate that as much as $225 million could have been saved
  for 100 drugs with the greatest amount of Medicaid reimbursements in Calendar Year
  1994, if reimbursement had been based on the findings of this report. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) work
  to ensure that States reimburse the ingredient portion of Medicaid drugs in a manner
  more consistent with the findings of this report. Additionally, we are recommending
  that HCFA study any of the other factors (for example dispensing fees) which they
  believe could significantly impact pharmacy reimbursement. We remain available
  to assist HCFA in conducting other studies that will aid in the implementation
  of these recommendations. The HCFA Administrator responded to our draft report
  in a memorandum dated March 18, 1997. In that memorandum, HCFA agreed with the
  findings and recommendations of this report. </p>
