<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Our objectives were to analyze 
Texas’s Medicaid Graduate Medical Education (GME) payment formula and the 
methods Texas used to establish the amount of funds that individual hospitals 
would receive and to determine whether (1) Texas followed the approved State 
plan in administering the Medicaid GME program and (2) intergovernmental 
transfers (IGTs) included any program funds. The State made unallowable Medicaid 
GME payments to ineligible hospitals totaling $318,778 ($175,323 Federal share). 
We recommended that Texas refund $318,778 ($175,323 Federal share) to CMS for 
the overpayments made to ineligible hospitals and review the eligibility of each 
teaching hospital annually.&nbsp; Texas partially agreed with our findings and 
recommendations.&nbsp; State officials have recouped $256,735 and plan to 
recoup an additional $14,739. State officials will review the remaining $47,304 
and recoup any unallowable amounts.</p>
