<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit of the Administration for
  Children and Families' grant to the Youth Shelters and Family Services (YSFS) for
  the Transitional Living Program. This grant covered the 3-year period November
  1, 1996 through October 31, 1999. The objectives of the audit were to determine
  if YSFS: (1) achieved the grant objectives, (2) complied with standard terms and
  conditions of the grant, and (3) maintained a system of accounting and internal
  controls capable of managing Federal funds. The YSFS was able to achieve all grant
  objectives to assist homeless youth, 16 to 21 years of age. Also, YSFS generally
  complied with the standard terms and conditions of the grant as well as established
  and followed accounting procedures enabling it to manage and account for Federal
  funds. However, our audit of YSFS' accounting controls revealed weaknesses that
  need to be corrected.&nbsp; The YSFS generally agreed with our recommendations
  and provided information on steps it is or has already taken to comply with the
  recommendations. However, we continue to believe that YSFS needs to ensure the
  accuracy of its SF-269s and strengthen controls over fixed assets. </p>
