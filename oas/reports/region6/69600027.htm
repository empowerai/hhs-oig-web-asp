<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of Medicare hospice beneficiary
  eligibility determinations at the Visiting Nurse Association of Texas Hospice (VNA)
  in Dallas, Texas. This audit was part of Operation Restore Trust (ORT), a joint
  initiative among various Department of Health and Human Services components. The
  ORT seeks to identifiy specific vulnerabilities in the Medicare program and pursue
  ways to reduce Medicare&#146;s exposure to abusive practices. </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to evaluate hospice eligibility determinations
  for beneficiaries that remained in hospice care for more than 210 days. We also
  determined the amount of payments made to the Visiting Nurse Association of Texas
  (VNA) for those Medicare beneficiaries that did not meet the Medicare reimbursement
  requirements. </p>
<p>Our review included a medical evaluation of VNA&#146;s eligibility determinations
  for 77 Medicare beneficiaries who had been in hospice care for more than 210 days.
  Of the 77 cases, 55 were active in hospice at the time of our review and represent
  28 percent of the 199 patients who were active Medicare hospice beneficiaries at
  VNA as of February 8, 1996. Our review showed that 25 beneficiaries were not eligible
  for hospice coverage at the time of admission. One of these 25 beneficiaries became
  eligible 4 months after his first admission. </p>
<p>Our medical determinations were made by physicians who were consultants to the
  Texas Medical Foundation, the Texas Peer Review organization (PRO). Staff from
  the fiscal intermediary, Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators (PGBA), have
  also reviewed narrative inforrriation written by the PRO physicians as well as
  data extracted from medical files for each of the 77 cases. The PGBA agrees with
  the PRO&#146;s decisions. </p>
<p>We believe the identified discrepancies with the 25 beneficiaries occurred due
  to inaccurate prognoses of life expectancy by hospice physicians based on the medical
  evidence in the patients&#146; files. The VNA received Medicare payments for hospice
  sefices totaling $1,242,806 for ineligible patients. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the intermediary:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>-- Recover payments of $1,242,806 for the 25 beneficiaries who were not eligible
      for Medicare hospice benefits; Recover payments made on behalf of ineligible
      beneficiaries after February 29, 1996;    </dt>
    </dd>
    <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>-- Coordinate with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in providing
        training to hospice providers and physicians on eligibility requirements
        for hospice beneficiaries, particularly the requirement for a 6-month prognosis;      </dt>
      </dd>
      <dd>
      <dl>
        <dt>-- Analyze utilization trends to identify hospices with large increases
          in claims for beneficiaries with over 210 days of hospice coverage and
          conduct medical reviews on a sample of their claims        </dt>
        </dd>
        <dd>
        <dl>
          <dt>-- Conduct periodic reviews of hospice claims to ensure the hospices
            are obtaining sufficient medical information to make valid eligibility
            determinations.
              <p>The intermediary responded to a draft of this audit report on November
                18, 1996. The intermediary officials have reviewed information that
                we provided and they concur with the eligibility determinations made
                by the PRO physicians. However, they stated that they would be reluctant
                to recover payments. These officials believe that the beneficiary
                would be held liable in these situations and HCFA had instructed
                them to educate providers rather than deny services for the time
                period in question. The intermediary officials stated that hospice
                data is currently included in the intermediary&#146;s focused medical
                review data analysis process and its education department regularly
                conducts education workshops on eligibility requirements for hospice
                providers and physicians. </p>
              <p>We will be working with HCFA on the beneficiary liability issue
                and the recovery of overpayments from the hospice. </p>
