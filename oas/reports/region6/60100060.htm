<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out that five pharmaceutical manufacturers, makers 
  of the 11 prescription drugs included in our review, overcharged 340B-covered 
  entities an estimated $6.1 million for the drugs during the year ended September 
  30, 1999. The overcharges represented 45 percent of the amount paid by the covered 
  entities, and occurred because the drug manufacturers inappropriately excluded 
  sales to health maintenance organization repackagers in calculating their best 
  price determinations, thereby increasing the prices charged to 340B entities. 
  We recommended that the Health Resources and Services Administration require 
  the five drug manufacturers to identify the exact amount of the overcharges 
  for each of the affected 340B entities and apply the overcharge amounts as offsets 
  or credits to each entity’s future purchases. The HRSA concurred with our recommendation.</p>
