<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the claims that
    Synergy Rehab Services Inc.&nbsp;(Synergy) submitted for partial hospitalization program
    (PHP) services met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; For 51 of 100 sampled claims,
    medical reviewers determined that Medicare reimbursement requirements were not met, primarily
    for two reasons:&nbsp; (1) the patient did not need, or was unable to benefit from, the
    services; and (2) the patient's medical records lacked the required documentation.&nbsp; We
    recommended that CMS determine the allowability of the claims that resulted in our $3,098,296
    statistical estimate of unallowable payments.&nbsp; Synergy strongly disagreed with the
    findings and took issue with many aspects of the review, including the audit review process
    and the medical determinations.&nbsp; We have issued the final report directly to CMS for
    resolution.</p>
