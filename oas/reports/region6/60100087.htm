<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective 
  of this audit was to determine whether outpatient observation services billed 
  by Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas (Hospital) met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; 
  Our review covered service dates between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1999.&nbsp; 
  The Hospital billed Medicare for observation services that did not meet Medicare 
  criteria, resulting in an estimated overpayment of $361,832.&nbsp; We audited 
  a statistical sample of 100 claims that contained observation services and determined 
  that 35 percent of the observation services did not meet Medicare requirements.&nbsp; 
  These observation services were primarily unallowable because medical records 
  contained standing orders for observation, physicians’ orders were not documented 
  in the medical records, and &nbsp;medical records documented that there were 
  no complications following an outpatient procedure.&nbsp; The Hospital developed 
  an action plan in 1999 to address the problems with observation service billings.&nbsp; 
  We recommended that 
  the fiscal intermediary recover the overpayment amount of $361,832, and review 
  future observation claims to ensure the hospital’s action plan continues to 
  reduce unallowable observation billing.&nbsp; The fiscal intermediary concurred 
  with our recommendations.&nbsp; </p>
