<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report identified issues, which resulted in unallowable costs totaling
  at least $1,243,446 federal share.&nbsp; Further, school districts did not
  obtain referrals for occupational therapy services or referrals for speech
  therapy services, which resulted in additional unallowable costs totaling at
  least $1,089,328 federal share.&nbsp; We also could not reasonably determine
  whether school districts met the state share requirement, which totaled $2,801,658
  due to the various errors identified with their calculations, inclusion of
  inappropriate expenditures, and use of inappropriate funding sources.&nbsp; In
  addition, we identified the following areas of concern needing corrective action:&nbsp; (1)
  the rates associated with school-based Medicaid services; (2) billing agency
  involvement in school districts' school-based Medicaid programs; and (3) the
  school-based health service providers' qualifications.&nbsp; Recommendations
  call for financial adjustments and internal control improvements.</p>
