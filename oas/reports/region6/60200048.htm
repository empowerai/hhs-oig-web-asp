<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether St. Hope Foundation (Foundation) 
  spent Ryan White Title I funds in accordance with federal guidelines during 
  the period March 1, 2001 through February 28, 2002.&nbsp; The Foundation provided 
  services in accordance with the terms of the Title I grant award and the contracts 
  with the Houston, Texas eligible metropolitan area (EMA).&nbsp; However, we 
  identified unsupported costs totaling $8,369, and further determined that the 
  Foundation’s general ledger did not reconcile to its final financial report. 
  &nbsp;In response to our findings, the Foundation provided support for some 
  of the questioned costs, provided explanation for the reconciliation discrepancy, 
  and will submit a revised final financial report to the EMA.&nbsp; The Foundation 
  reclassified the remainder of the questioned costs $5,367 as unrestricted funds, 
  and therefore does not believe a refund of this amount is due.&nbsp; However, 
  since the Foundation already received reimbursement for this unsupported amount, 
  we believe that a refund through the EMA is still due.</p>
