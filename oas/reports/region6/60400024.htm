<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p> The objective of this audit was to determine whether Gallup Hospital had completed the credentialing, privileging, and
  personnel suitability reviews for its medical practitioners.&nbsp; For the 52 practitioners we reviewed, Gallup Hospital
  did not verify the credentials for 26, or 50 percent, to determine their current competence; ensure that 14, or 27 percent,
  had current privileges, with lapsed periods raging from 6 days to 6 months; or request the Office of Personnel Management
  to perform a background investigation of 23, or 44 percent.&nbsp; Gallup Hospital's management had not ensured that the
  credentialing, privileging, and personnel suitability review processes received the necessary level of priority in terms
  of management attention and availability of resources such as a computerized credentialing system.&nbsp; As a result, the
  hospital's management could not assert its full assurance that its practitioners had the appropriate qualifications, authorizations,
  and personnel history to provide patient care.&nbsp; We recommended that the Indian Health Service (IHS) ensure that Gallup
  Hospital's management establishes a system to routinely&nbsp; perform credentialing, privileging, and suitability reviews.&nbsp; The
  IHS stated that all recommended corrective actions had been taken.</p>
