<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:40.0pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Our objectives were to 
determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented the recommendations made 
in our previous audit of the Arkansas drug rebate program and (2) established 
controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by 
physicians.<b> </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency implemented the recommendations from our 
prior audit that related to interest payments received from manufacturers, with 
one exception:&nbsp; It did not implement a procedure for verifying the accuracy of 
interest payments received from manufacturers. The State agency established 
controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by 
physicians.&nbsp; </p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We reiterated our 
recommendation that the State agency implement a procedure to ensure that 
interest payments are verified for accuracy.<b><span style="color:red"> &nbsp;</span></b>The 
State agency agreed with our finding and said that it would put procedures for 
verifying interest in writing.&nbsp; The State agency also said that it was verifying 
current and past interest payments.</span>
