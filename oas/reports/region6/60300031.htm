<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This report consolidates the results of 10 individual reviews of States' Medicaid disproportionate
  share hospital (DSH) programs, conducted at the request of CMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Two common objectives of our individual reviews were to determine whether (1) States
  complied with the hospital-specific DSH limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Social Security
  Act (the Act) and (2) hospitals returned any DSH payments to States through intergovernmental
  transfers of funds.&nbsp; Nine of the ten States reviewed did not comply with the hospital-specific
  DSH limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Act.&nbsp; As a result, DSH payments exceeded
  the hospital-specific limits by approximately $1.6 billion ($902 million Federal share),
  including:&nbsp; (1) four States that made approximately $679 million in excess DSH payments
  based primarily on historical costs rather than actual costs; and (2) eight States that made
  approximately $223 million in excess DSH payments because they included unallowable costs
  in their calculations of hospital-specific limits.&nbsp; As to our second objective, three
  States required hospitals to return DSH payments totaling approximately $3.6 billion through
  intergovernmental transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We recommended that CMS: (a) ensure that the monetary recommendations concerning DSH
  payments that exceeded the hospital-specific limits have been resolved; (b) establish regulations
  requiring States to (1) implement procedures to ensure that future DSH payments are adjusted
  to actual incurred costs, (2) incorporate these adjustment procedures into their approved
  State plans, and (3) include only allowable costs as uncompensated care costs in their DSH
  calculations; and (c) strengthen its review and approval of State plans to ensure consistency
  with Federal requirements and use the results of audits conducted under MMA as part of its
  review process.&nbsp; In comments on the draft report, CMS agreed with our recommendations
  but interpreted our first recommendation to apply only prospectively, not as a requirement
  to seek recovery of the excess DSH payments we had identified.&nbsp; We maintain that the
  Federal share of these excess payments should be recouped.</p>
