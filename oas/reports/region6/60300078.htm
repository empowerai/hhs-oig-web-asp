<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">The objective of this review 
was to determine whether the services on rehabilitation claims paid to Gulf 
Health Care Center (Gulf) of Texas City, Texas,<b> </b>were medically necessary 
and adequately supported by medical documentation.&nbsp; Of the 100 claims 
sampled, Gulf submitted 69 claims that did not meet Medicare requirements.&nbsp; 
Based on our sample results, we estimate Medicare overpaid Gulf at least 
$671,456 for services that did not meet Medicare requirements.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">&nbsp; We 
recommended that Gulf refund to the Medicare program $671,456</span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">in overpayments for 
improperly paid rehabilitation claims, ensure that future rehabilitation claims 
comply with Medicare requirements on medical necessity, strengthen its 
procedures to ensure that all Medicare claims are supported by adequate medical 
documentation, and work with the fiscal intermediary to determine the amount of 
overpayments made subsequent to our audit period.&nbsp; Gulf disagreed with our 
findings.</span></p>
