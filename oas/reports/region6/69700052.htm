<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that requiring drug manufacturers to pay Medicaid
  drug rebates based on the average wholesale price (AWP) of drugs, instead of the
  average manufacturers price (AMP), would have resulted in about $1.15 billion in
  added Medicaid rebates for Calendar Years 1994 through 1996 for only the top 100
  drugs (in terms of Medicaid reimbursement). Such a requirement would also; (1)
  eliminate inconsistences in the present methods used by drug manufacturers to calculate
  AMP, (2) establish a much needed connection between the calculation of Medicaid
  drug rebates and the calculation of Medicaid's reimbursement for drugs at the pharmacy
  level, and (3) reduce the burden of administering the Medicaid drug rebate program
  at the Federal, State, and manufacturer levels. We recommended that the Health
  Care Financing Administration develop and submit a legislative proposal to the
  Congress that would require drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid outpatient
  prescription drug program to pay Medicaid drug rebates based on AWP. The HCFA did
  not concur, stating that they did not believe such legislation would be feasible
  at this time. The HCFA did agree, however, that changing from AMP to AWP would
  reduce the administrative burden involved in the AMP calculations, and that they
  are planning a comprehensive study of AWP. </p>
