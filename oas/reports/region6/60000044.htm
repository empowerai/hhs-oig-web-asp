<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Under Medicare rules, a consolidation of hospitals is considered a change of 
  ownership. After a consolidation, only the surviving hospital would be entitled 
  to Medicare payments because it was the legal owner on the date patients were 
  discharged. This final report points out that 15 hospitals, that technically 
  ceased to exist after consolidation with another hospital, were paid for 1,118 
  discharges that should not have been billed to Medicare. Issues that arise include 
  potential duplicate payments and inflated cost reports. We have identified claims 
  overpayments of more than $4.5 million for 6 of the 15 hospitals and will make 
  appropriate referrals to fiscal intermediaries for recovery. Fiscal intermediaries 
  have recovered nearly $300,000 related to 2 consolidations and have begun recovery 
  actions related to 2 additional consolidations. Further, the Department of Justice 
  has reached settlements totaling nearly $3.2 million related to 5 consolidations. 
  Among other things, we recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
  Services (CMS) review current claim, cost report, audit, and change of ownership 
  instructions to determine whether revisions or additions are necessary to clearly 
  address proper claim fining and cost treatment when a change of ownership or 
  consolidation occurs. The CMS concurred with our recommendations.</p>
