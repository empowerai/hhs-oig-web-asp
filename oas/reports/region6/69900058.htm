<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that infusion services provided in 22 skilled nursing
  facilities (SNFs) were often unnecessary, overpriced, and/or misclassified on SNF
  cost reports. As a result, the 22 SNFs were reimbursed unallowable costs totaling
  approximately $5.3 million ($4.8 million for services not medically necessary)
  out of $9 million claimed during 1995 through 1998. The primary problem was the
  old retrospective reasonable cost-based reimbursement system which was vulnerable
  to abusive billing schemes. Currently, SNFs are paid under a prospective payment
  system (PPS). We recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
  consider the impact of improper payments for infusion therapy services before making
  any refinements or updates to the SNF prospective payment rates. We also recommended
  that HCFA identify and recover overpayments which were made to SNFs for unnecessary
  and overpriced infusion services prior to the adoption of PPS, and direct its contractors
  to perform medical reviews of selected SNF patients to ensure that patients are
  receiving appropriate levels of infusion therapy. The HCFA generally agreed with
  our recommendations. </p>
