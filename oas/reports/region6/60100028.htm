<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our audit 
  work related to outpatient observation services billed by St. Francis Hospital 
  (Hospital) in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&nbsp; The objective of our audit was to determine 
  whether outpatient observation services billed by the Hospital met the Medicare 
  reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Our review covered service dates between July 
  1, 1996 and June&nbsp;30, 2000 (fiscal years 1997-2000).&nbsp; The Hospital 
  billed Medicare for observation services that did not meet Medicare criteria, 
  resulting in an estimated overpayment of $298,549.&nbsp; We audited a statistical 
  sample of 100&nbsp;claims that contained observation services and determined 
  that 80 percent of the observation services did not meet Medicare requirements. 
  &nbsp;These services were unallowable primarily because physician’s orders 
  were not documented in the medical records, or the medical records contained 
  a standing order for observation.&nbsp; We are recommending that the fiscal 
  intermediary recover the overpayment amount for inappropriate observation billings 
  of $298,549, and instruct the Hospital to develop procedures to correct control 
  problems.&nbsp; The fiscal intermediary concurred with our recommendations.</p>
