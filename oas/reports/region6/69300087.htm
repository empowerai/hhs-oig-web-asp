<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report discusses the effectiveness of the Health Care Financing
  Administration's (HCFA) investigation and resolution of so-called patient dumping
  complaints. The report points out that HCFA's regional offices were not always
  consistent in; (1) conducting timely investigations of patient dumping complaints,
  (2) sending acknowledgments to complainants, (3) ensuring that provisions of the
  Act were addressed in substantiating violations, and (4) ensuring that violations
  were referred to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for consideration of civil
  monetary penalties. We recommended that HCFA amend its guidelines to the regional
  offices, conduct training on the requirements concerning patient dumping, ensure
  that all regional offices are following established procedures, and improve its
  process for referring cases to the OIG. The HCFA concurred with our findings and
  recommendations and has taken corrective action. </p>
