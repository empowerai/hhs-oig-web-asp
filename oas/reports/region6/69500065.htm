<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This review, part of a nationwide audit of pharmacy drug acquisition costs requested
  by the Health Care Financing Administration, was made to develop an estimate of
  the difference between the actual acquisition costs of drugs of the dispensing
  pharmacy and the average wholesale price (AWP) used by States in helping establish
  drug reimbursement amounts. Most States reimburse pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions
  using a formula which generally discounts the AWP by 10.5 percent. This review
  was made in 11 States. This final report discloses results in Florida. In Florida
  the overall estimate of the extent that AWP exceeded pharmacy purchase invoice
  prices was 20.2 percent for brand names drugs and 41.5 percent for generic drugs.
  We believe that the differences between AWP and pharmacy acquisition costs as determined
  by our review are significant enough to warrant consideration by the State in any
  evaluation of the drug program. Therefore, we recommended that the State agency
  consider the results of our review in determining any future changes to pharmacy
  reimbursement for Medicaid drugs in Florida. </p>
