<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to assess whether additional benefits proposed 
  in Ochsner's Contract Year (CY) 2000 adjusted community rate proposal (ACRP) 
  were available to Medicare beneficiaries as advertised and were comparable to 
  costs actually incurred, and whether the actual additional benefits were properly 
  valued.&nbsp; Our review showed that, during 2000, Ochsner provided the additional 
  benefits proposed in its CY 2000 ACRP.&nbsp; However, we found that Ochsner 
  distributed the incorrect prescription drug formulary guide to its Medicare 
  enrollees, resulting in overpayment of prescription drug copayments totaling 
  $4,281 by 104 enrollees.&nbsp; Ochsner told us that they are refunding those 
  overpayments.</p>
