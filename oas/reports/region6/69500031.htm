<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report presents results of an audit of the Medicaid non-inpatient laboratory
  services program in Louisiana for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31,
  1994. This review was conducted by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor (LLA). This
  work was conducted as part of our partnership efforts with State Auditors to expand
  audit coverage of the Medicaid program. The LLA found that edits to ensure that
  laboratory services are properly bundled were not sufficient to detect and prevent
  payments for tests that were not properly bundled and/or duplicated. Also, failure
  to require the bundling of two individual automated tests could result in additional
  costs to the State and Medicaid program. Finally, Medicaid fee schedules were not
  updated in a timely manner. </p>
