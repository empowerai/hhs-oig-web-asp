<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the fiscal intermediary 
  and two Sharp HealthCare hospitals--Sharp Cabrillo (Cabrillo) and Sharp Memorial 
  (Memorial) complied with Medicare's regulations, which pertains to Medicare 
  reimbursement when a hospital has a change of ownership.&nbsp; The consolidation 
  of two hospitals is considered a change of ownership.&nbsp; Cabrillo improperly 
  received $100,340 in payments for 18 claims that it should not have submitted 
  to Medicare.&nbsp; The claims should not have been submitted because Cabrillo 
  consolidated with Memorial, which was the legal entity entitled to submit these 
  18 claims.</p>
<p>The consolidation of Cabrillo and Memorial resulted in claim submission errors 
  and cost report errors that neither the hospitals nor the FI had procedures 
  in place to recognize and correct.&nbsp; Therefore, we recommended that UGS 
  and Sharp HealthCare work together to determine the correct consolidation date 
  for Cabrillo and Memorial; determine and make the necessary adjustments to Medicare 
  claims and cost reports based on the confirmed consolidation date; and report 
  the results of the corrective actions taken to the OIG.&nbsp; In addition, we 
  recommend that UGS, as the successor FI, determine whether it needs to establish 
  procedures to (1) identify when hospital consolidations occur and (2) ensure 
  that all of the hospitals involved in a consolidation comply with the Medicare 
  regulations.&nbsp; The UGS agreed with our recommendations and has worked with 
  Sharp to resolve these issues.&nbsp; At this time, UGS and Sharp have voided 
  and adjusted claims as appropriate, but the final cost report corrections have 
  not been finalized.&nbsp; Additionally, UGS officials have informed us that 
  they have established procedures that should prevent similar errors in the future 
  when two or more hospitals consolidate.</p>
