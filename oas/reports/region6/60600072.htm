<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the $6.5 million in costs incurred by TMF Health Quality 
Institute (TMF) for the period February 1, 2003, through January 31, 2006, 
$403,000 was unallowable and $49,000 was potentially unallowable. <br>
<br>
The Senate Finance Committee requested that the Office of Inspector General 
assess the fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations 
with respect to six specified fiscal integrity areas.<span style="color: blue">&nbsp;
</span>This report is one of a series of nine reports on audits of QIOs 
nationwide.<br>
<br>
We recommended that TMF (1) refund $17,000 for unallowable legal fees and 
consultant travel; (2) reduce the indirect cost pool by $386,000 for severance 
packages for executives, board member and executive travel, and conference 
costs; and (3) work with the CMS contracting officer to determine what portion 
of the $49,000 incurred for compensation during our audit period should be 
excluded from the indirect cost pool for purposes of determining final rates.&nbsp; TMF disagreed with most of our findings and believes that only $35,200 was 
unallowable.</p>
