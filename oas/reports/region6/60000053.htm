<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out significant potential improper payments to suppliers
  for inhalation drugs by the Region C Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier
  (DMERC) for the 12-month period ending September 30, 1999. Based on a statistical
  sample, we estimate such payments totaled $134 million. Claims were unallowable
  ($46 million) because payments were for noncovered items of supplies (drugs billed
  without a prescription) or the items or supplies were not reasonable and necessary
  for the beneficiary&#146;s condition. Claims for which there was insufficient documentation
  to determine allowability totaled $88 million. This problem occurred primarily
  because, with some exceptions, the DMERC had no procedures in place to &quot;look
  behind&quot; the claim at the beneficiary&#146;s medical record or at the documentation
  maintained by the suppliers. Recommendations call for improvements to procedures
  and controls and financial adjustments.</p>
