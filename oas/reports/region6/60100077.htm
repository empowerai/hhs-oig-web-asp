<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether school districts in Oklahoma 
  billed Medicaid for school-based health services that were (1) provided free 
  to other students, and (2) not exempt under the Individuals with Disabilities 
  Education Act (IDEA). We found Oklahoma lacks procedures to ensure that health 
  services billed under the non-IDEA system were not provided free to all students. 
  Based on our review and additional documentation provided by the state after 
  issuance of the draft report, the services provided to the 100 selected beneficiaries 
  we reviewed were all incorrectly billed. Services for 97 of the beneficiaries 
  were billed incorrectly because the services were provided free to other students 
  and were not exempt under the IDEA program. The claims for the remaining three 
  beneficiaries were billed incorrectly because these beneficiaries and services 
  were IDEA eligible and should have been billed under the IDEA program. Based 
  on a projection of the statistical sample, we estimated at least $1,902,390 
  in federal financial participation was for services not in compliance with federal 
  guidelines and CMS policy. We recommended procedural improvements and a financial 
  adjustment for the $1,092,390. We also recommended that Oklahoma review periods 
  not covered in the audit period and make appropriate adjustments.</p>
