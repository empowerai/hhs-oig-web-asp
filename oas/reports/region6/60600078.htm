<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether 
therapy services provided by a Florida physical therapist during calendar year 
2003 met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Of the 100 sampled claims, 
96 did not meet Medicare’s reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; In total, 494 of 
the 702 physical therapy services contained in the 100 sampled claims did not 
meet one or more of the Medicare reimbursement requirements because (1) the 
physical therapist inappropriately used his provider identification number to 
bill for services performed or supervised by someone else, (2) the documentation 
for some therapy services did not meet Medicare requirements, (3) some therapy 
services were miscoded, and (4) a plan of care did not meet Medicare 
requirements. &nbsp;The physical therapist did not have a thorough understanding of 
Medicare requirements and did not have effective policies and procedures in 
place to ensure that he billed Medicare only for services that met Medicare 
reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; As a result, the physical therapist improperly 
billed Medicare and received $10,781 for the 494 services. We recommend that the 
physical therapist (1) refund to the Medicare program $411,781 in unallowable 
payments for therapy services provided in 2003 and (2) develop quality control 
procedures to ensure that therapy services are provided and documented in 
accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; The physical 
therapist stated that he will address any issues concerning the audit through 
the Medicare appeals process.</p>
