<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report on an audit of the Transportation Services for Montana's Medicaid
  Program for State Fiscal Years (FY) 1994 and 1995 was conducted by the Montana
  Legislative Auditor (MLA). The objective of the review was to determine if the
  Department of Public Health and Human Services' (Department) controls in place
  ensured that the payments for transportation services were necessary and reasonable. </p>
<p>This work was conducted as part of our partnership efforts with State Auditors
  to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program. As part of the review, the Office
  of Audit Services assisted the MLA by providing technical support through the Medicaid
  Partnership Plan. In addition, we have performed sufficient work to satisfy ourselves
  that the attached MLA report can be relied upon and used by the Health Care Financing
  Administration in meeting its program oversight responsibilities. </p>
<p>The MLA determined that the controls in place appear effective to assure that
  the payments for transportation services are necessary and reasonable but several
  improvements were identified which could further strengthen the control system. </p>
<p>The MLA recommended that the Department strengthen controls by (1) clarifying
  program monitoring contract requirements, (2) clearly delineating county program
  involvement and, (3) developing a method of recipient reimbursement in compliance
  with all statutes and regulations. The Department concurs with the recommendations. </p>
<p>As we do with all audit reports developed by nonfederal auditors, we have provided
  a listing of the coded recommendations for use in working with the State to resolve
  findings and recommendations through our stewardship report. </p>
<p>We plan to share this report with other States to encourage their participation
  in our partnership efforts. </p>
