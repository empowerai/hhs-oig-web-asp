<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of
    this audit was to determine whether organ acquisition costs claimed on the fiscal years (FYs) 1997
    through 2001 Medicare cost reports by Baylor for its lung, kidney, liver, heart, and pancreas transplant
    programs were allowable.&nbsp; Baylor did not comply with Medicare law, regulations, and guidelines
    for claiming organ acquisition costs in the preparation of its Medicare Part A cost reports and received
    excess Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; Baylor claimed $5,010,761 in
    unallowable costs, of which Medicare overpaid Baylor an estimated $4,195,303.&nbsp; Baylor also claimed
    $13,633,200 in unsupported costs.&nbsp; If Baylor cannot provide support for the $13,633,200, the
    result would be an estimated Medicare overpayment of $9,157,378.&nbsp; We recommended that the Medicare
    intermediary recover the Medicare overpayment of $4,195,303; work with Baylor and recover the portion
    of the $9,157,378 that Baylor is unable to support with allowable organ acquisition costs; review
    organ acquisition costs claimed in subsequent years for issues similar to those identified in FYs
    1997 through 2001, and recover any Medicare overpayments; monitor future Medicare cost report claims
    for organ acquisition costs from Baylor to ensure compliance with Medicare requirements; and instruct
    Baylor to develop and maintain adequate time-and-effort reporting and accounting controls, and to
    provide clear direction to personnel as to Medicare requirements for claiming and documenting organ
    acquisition costs.&nbsp; The Medicare intermediary agreed with our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; Baylor
    did not agree with our application of reasonable compensation equivalent limits.</p>
