<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (the
  State agency) limited cost outlier payments to exceptionally high-cost cases.&nbsp; The State
  agency did not limit cost outlier payments to exceptionally high-cost cases.&nbsp; Specifically,
  the State agency (1) did not use current cost-to-charge ratios, (2) used noncovered charges
  in calculating the outlier payments, and (3) did not have sufficient policies and procedures
  in place to monitor cost outlier payments.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency (1)
  revise its method of computing cost outlier payments and (2) develop policies and procedures
  to more closely monitor outlier payments.&nbsp; Texas disagreed with our recommendation to
  revise its method of computing cost outlier payments but agreed to review its processes and
  update its formal policies.</p>
