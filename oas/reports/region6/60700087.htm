<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether 
Pinnacle Business Solutions, Inc.’s (Pinnacle), high-dollar Medicare payments to 
New Mexico Part B providers were appropriate.&nbsp; Eleven of the 16 high-dollar 
payments that Pinnacle made to providers were appropriate. However, Pinnacle 
overpaid providers $39,539 for the remaining five payments.&nbsp; A provider refunded 
one overpayment of $1,048 prior to our fieldwork.&nbsp; Four overpayments totaling 
$38,491 remained outstanding.&nbsp; We recommended that Pinnacle recover the $38,491 
overpayment and consider using the results of this audit in its provider 
education activities. Pinnacle agreed with the findings and recommendations.</p>
