<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether high-dollar Medicare payments that Chisholm Administrative Services (Chisholm) made to providers for outpatient services were appropriate.&nbsp;All of the high-dollar Medicare outpatient payments were not appropriate. For calendar year 2003 and 2004 claims, Chisholm made 14 payments of $50,000 or more each for outpatient services.&nbsp;Our analysis indicated that, at the start of our fieldwork in February 2007, eight of the payments were incorrect, and the providers had refunded the $497,497 in overpayments, but six additional payments were incorrect and the provider had not refunded the $514,323 in overpayments. All overpayments that occurred during our review were due to incorrect, billing units.&nbsp;We recommended that Chisholm inform us of the status of the recovery of the $514,323 in overpayments that our audit identified and use the results of this audit in its provider education activities. Chisholm agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
