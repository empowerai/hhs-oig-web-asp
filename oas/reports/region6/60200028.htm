<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that from July 1, 1997 through January 31, 2002 
  a total of $1.4 million ($1.0 million Federal Share) in AFDC overpayments had 
  been recovered by the Arkansas Department of Human Services (ADHS).&nbsp; We 
  recommended that ADHS refund $1.0 million to the Administration for Children 
  and Families (ACF) in accordance with Federal requirements and that they refund 
  the Federal share of subsequent AFDC recoveries to ACF in the form of a check 
  at least quarterly.&nbsp; The ADHS stated it has established internal procedures 
  for processing and submitting AFDC overpayment collections and that it will 
  be refunding the recommended $1.0 million in overpayments within 30 days and 
  any subsequent overpayment recoveries on a quarterly basis beginning in September 
  2002.</p>
