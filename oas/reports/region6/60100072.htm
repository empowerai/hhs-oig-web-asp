<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit of grant number 90EF0036 awarded
  to Community Resource Group, Inc. (CRG) by the Administration for Children and
  Families (ACF), Office of Community Services (OCS).&nbsp; The award covered the
  period September 30, 1998 through September 29, 2000. The objectives of our audit
  were to assess CRG's performance in achieving project objectives; compliance with
  terms and conditions of the grant; and capability to properly record, account for
  and report on Federal funds. The CRG substantially achieved all of the project
  objectives.&nbsp; In addition, CRG complied with the terms and conditions of the
  grant.&nbsp; However, CRG did not always follow its procedures relating to drawing
  down Federal funds.&nbsp; The CRG did not concur. &nbsp; However, CRG needs to
  strengthen its internal controls to minimize the amount of Federal cash on hand
  as required by Federal regulations. </p>
