<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Medicaid payments made by
  the New Mexico Human Services Department (NMHSD) for members enrolled in the
  state’s Medicaid managed care program entitled, “SALUD!”.&nbsp; The objectives
  of our review were to determine whether managed care payments made under SALUD!
  were correct and for eligible members; and whether Medicaid payments made under
  the fee-for-service (FFS) program were for services already covered under SALUD!.&nbsp; Our
  review disclosed that NMHSD made incorrect managed care and FFS payments totaling
  about $3.6 million.&nbsp; We recommended that NMHSD refund the federal share
  totaling about $2.6 million related to the overpayments; maintain accurate
  and complete eligibility information; and consider revising its contracts with
  managed care organizations (MCOs) to allow for recovery of overpayments beyond
  the 24-month limitation and regardless of whether the MCOs provided services.&nbsp; The
  NMHSD agreed with our findings and are in the process of determining the overpayments
  and taking corrective action.</p>
