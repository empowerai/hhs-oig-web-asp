<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>This report provides the results of an audit of Medicaid payments made by the
  Texas Department of Health (TDH) under the State of Texas Access Reform (STAR)
  managed care program.&nbsp; The review disclosed that managed care payments made
  for 437 STAR members during the period September 1, 1998 through August 31, 2000,
  were improper because the members were either:&nbsp; (1) not eligible and the payment
  amount should have been zero; or (2) misclassified as dual eligible and the payment
  amount may need to be adjusted.&nbsp; We recommended that the Commission: (1) review
  and revise as necessary, the State&#146;s payment system for STAR enrollees in
  order to ensure that Medicare entitlement dates are identified in a timely manner,
  and managed care payments are not made for ineligible STAR enrollees; (2) ensure
  that TDH reviews and makes the appropriate payment adjustments for the 437&nbsp;members
  inappropriately enrolled in the STAR program under the Medicare risk group during
  FYs&nbsp;1999 and 2000 and report the results of the adjustments to the Office
  of Inspector General; and (3) ensure that TDH identifies, reviews, and makes the
  appropriate payment adjustments for STAR members assigned to the Medicare risk
  group for prior years.</p>
