<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Most States use average wholesale price
    (AWP) minus a percentage discount, which varies by State, as a basis for reimbursing
    pharmacies for drug prescriptions.&nbsp; Therefore, the objective of this review
    was to develop for the Indiana Medicaid program an estimate of the discount below
    AWP at which pharmacies purchase brand name and generic drugs.&nbsp; Our estimate
    of the overall discount below AWP for the invoice prices we reviewed was 21.78
    percent for brand name drugs and 66.71 percent for generic drugs.&nbsp; Our national
    estimates, included in reports previously issued were 21.84 percent and 65.93
    percent respectively.&nbsp; We recommended that the Indiana Family and Social
    Services Administration (State Agency) consider the results of our review as
    a factor in any future changes to pharmacy reimbursement for Medicaid drugs.&nbsp; The
  State Agency concurred.</p>
