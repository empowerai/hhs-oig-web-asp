<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to identify the number of children who received
  Medicaid benefits from Texas, during the period June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002,
  because their non-custodial parent (NCP) could not provide court ordered medical
  support because it was not available or too costly.&nbsp; We estimate 86,011 children
  received Medicaid benefits during the period June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002
  because their NCP could not provide court ordered medical support.&nbsp; Of these
  86,011 children, we estimate that 60,271 had NCPs who could, however, have been
  able to contribute $16.6 million towards Medicaid costs totaling $36.9 million
  incurred by the State and Federal Government on behalf of these children.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Texas Legislature strengthened its provisions for health care coverage
  by requiring the court to order the custodial parent to apply for benefits under
  either the Medicaid program or the State child health plan if neither parent had
  access to private health insurance at a reasonable cost.&nbsp; In addition, the
  court must order that the NCP contribute cash medical support payments for actual
  costs of their child's participation in such program.&nbsp; Court orders written
  under prior Texas law did not require NCPs to contribute towards Medicaid costs
  when private health insurance was not available.&nbsp; We recommended that Texas
  ensure medical support orders written under prior laws, for children receiving
  Medicaid benefits, are revised as they come up for modification to require NCPs
  to contribute towards Medicaid costs paid on behalf of their children.&nbsp; State
  IV-D officials agreed with our recommendation.</p>
