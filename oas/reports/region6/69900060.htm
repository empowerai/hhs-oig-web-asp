<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Humana, Inc., a national managed care organization chain, submitted a claim to
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) asserting that CMS, in many
  cases, had based payments for enrolled Medicare beneficiaries on incorrect State
  and county address codes resulting in a net underpayment to Humana of $21.7 million
  for the period October 1991 through December 1997.Our review, at CMS&#146; request,
  showed the claim should be reduced to about $9.5 million. The $12.2 million overstatement
  was due to; duplicate items in the claim and for beneficiaries not enrolled in
  a Humana plan ($1.3 million), amounts not supported by Humana&#146;s records ($10.2
  million), and items that were not, but should have been, included in Humana&#146;s
  claim ($0.7 million). In our final report we recommended, in addition to a reduction
  of $12.2 million in Humana&#146;s claim, that CMS establish stringent guidelines
  for accepting additional documentation from Humana for claims that should be fully
  developed and supportable before submission to CMS. The CMS concurred with our
  recommendation.</p>
