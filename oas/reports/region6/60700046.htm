<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the period January 1 through December 31, 2002, we 
estimate that Medicare overpaid Four Seasons Nursing Center (Four Seasons) 
$792,000 for skilled services that were not (1) medically necessary at the level 
provided in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and/or at the Resource Utilization 
Group (RUG) level claimed, (2) adequately supported by adequate documentation, and 
(3) properly billed.&nbsp; Medicare pays SNFs a daily rate to cover skilled services 
provided to Medicare beneficiaries.&nbsp; For billing purposes, SNFs complete an 
assessment form that places a patient in a specific payment group, known as a 
RUG, based on the patient’s care and resource needs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that Four 
Seasons (1) refund to the Medicare program $792,000 in overpayments, (2) work with CMS 
to resolve the potential overpayment set-aside totaling approximately $91,000, 
(3) ensure that future claims with skilled services comply with Medicare 
requirements for medical necessity, (4) strengthen its procedures to ensure that all 
Medicare claims are supported by adequate medical documentation and properly 
billed, and (5) work with its fiscal intermediary to determine the amount of any 
overpayments made subsequent to our audit period.<span style="color:red">&nbsp;
</span>Four Seasons disagreed with most of our findings and took issue with many 
aspects of the review.&nbsp; However, we rely on the knowledge and expertise of our 
medical reviewers and stand by our findings and recommendations.</p>
