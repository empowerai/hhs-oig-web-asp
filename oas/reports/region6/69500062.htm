<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a nationwide audit of pharmacy drug acquisition
  costs at the Health Care Financing Administration's request. The objective of the
  nationwide review is to develop an estimate of the difference between the actual
  acquisition costs of drugs of pharmacies and the average wholesale price (AWP)
  used by States in helping establish drug reimbursement amounts. Most States reimburse
  pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions using a formula which generally discounts
  the AWP by 10.5 percent. This review was made in 11 States. This final report discloses
  results in California. In California the overall estimate of the extent that AWP
  exceeded pharmacy purchase invoice prices was 17.5 percent for brand names drugs
  and 41.4 percent for generic drugs. We believe that the difference between AWP
  and pharmacy acquisition costs as determined by our review are significant enough
  to warrant consideration by the State in any evaluation of the drug program. Therefore,
  we recommended that the State agency consider the results of our review in determining
  any future changes to pharmacy reimbursement for Medicaid drugs in California.
  The State concurred and stated they intend to use our report to support a provision
  in their Governor's budget proposal to decrease drug ingredient reimbursement. </p>
