<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>We audited the Arkansas Department of Health’s (State agency) Public Health Preparedness and Response
  for Bioterrorism Program (Program) funding for the budget periods August 31, 1999, to August 30, 2000;
  August 31, 2000, to August 30, 2001; and August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003 to determine whether the
  State agency (1) ensured that Program funds were not used to supplant current State or local funding;
  (2) recorded and reported Program funds awarded, expended, obligated, and unobligated by focus area
  in accordance with the cooperative agreement; and (3) ensured that Program funds were used for necessary,
  reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs in accordance with the terms of the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; The
  State agency (1) supplanted State funds with Federal funds; (2) did not submit a final Financial Status
  Report for the budget period August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003, and did not submit the interim report
  by focus area; (3) reported over $2 million as unobligated on its interim Financial Status Report for
  budget period August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003;&nbsp; (4) was unable to reconcile the Financial
  Status Report to the accounting records for the budget period August 31, 2000, to August 30, 2001,
  and locate two invoices, totaling approximately $35,000, requested for the budget period August 31,
  1999, to August 30, 2000; (5) did not allocate employees’ time and effort to reflect the actual percentage
  of time devoted to the Program; and (6) charged State-funded positions to the Program in two instances
  without the knowledge of Program officials.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency provide the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with documentation
  on the supplanting of State funds and request guidance on how to appropriately resolve this issue.&nbsp; In
  addition, we recommended that the State agency implement internal control procedures and a time allocation
  system.&nbsp; In a written response to our report, the State agency either provided explanations for
  its actions or explained what steps it has taken to address our findings.</p>
