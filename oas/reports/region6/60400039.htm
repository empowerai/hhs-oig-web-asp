<p>This final report addresses credentialing, privileging, and personnel suitability practices at the Creek
  Nation Community Hospital (Creek Hospital).&nbsp; Tribally operated hospitals, including Creek Hospital, are not required
  to follow Indian Health Service (IHS) credentialing, privileging, and accreditation requirements.&nbsp; Although the Creek
  Hospital is not required to comply with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission)
  standards, the hospital’s bylaws require hospital management to follow a standardized credentialing and privileging process
  consistent with Joint Commission standards. The hospital completed credentialing and privileging reviews for all 17 practitioners
  in our review, as required by their bylaws.&nbsp; However, Creek Hospital did not complete personnel suitability reviews
  for any of its contract practitioners, as required by the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act of
  1990.&nbsp; Hospital officials told us that they were unaware the Act required tribes or tribal organizations to conduct
  personnel suitability reviews through background investigations.&nbsp; Subsequently, the hospital began to develop procedures
  to conduct background investigations on all practitioners.&nbsp; We recommended that Creek Hospital continue its efforts
  to establish written procedures and controls to ensure that background investigations are performed on all medical staff
  in accordance with the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act.&nbsp; Hospital officials agreed with
  our recommendation.</p>
