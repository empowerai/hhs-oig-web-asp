<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of requests
    for anticipated payments (RAPs) under the Medicare home health (HH) prospective
    payment system (PPS) at Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators, LLC (Palmetto).&nbsp; Due
    to system problems with the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS), Palmetto
    improperly paid about $15 million to home health agencies (HHAs) for non-covered
    and denied charges. &nbsp; We recommended that Palmetto (i) take action to recover
    improperly paid RAPs and (ii)&nbsp;implement procedures to ensure that future
    overpayments are identified and recovered timely.&nbsp; Palmetto stated it had
    manually cancelled the improperly paid RAPs and recouped 95 percent of the amount
    due.&nbsp; We did not perform any tests to verify that Palmetto cancelled these
    improperly paid RAPs and correctly calculated the amount systematically recouped.
  We plan to follow-up on Palmetto&#146;s recovery actions in the future.</p>
