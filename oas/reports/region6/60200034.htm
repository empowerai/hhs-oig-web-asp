<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that the Scott and White Health Plan (Plan) overstated
  costs claimed on both its 1999 and 2000 Medicare cost reports by about $8.2
  million.&nbsp; In addition, the Plan was not in compliance with the financial
  disclosure requirements for related party administrative costs totaling about
  $14 million for both 1999 and 2000.&nbsp; We recommended that the Plan file
  amended Medicare cost reports for 1999 and 2000 decreasing the amount claimed
  by $8.2 million.&nbsp; We also recommended that the Plan; (1) adhere to the
  reporting requirements for disclosing significant related party transactions,
  (2) make sure that the duplicate payment controls are functioning properly,
  and (3) file amended Medicare cost reports for errors impacting prior years.&nbsp; The
  Plan generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
