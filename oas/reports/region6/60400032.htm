<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether TriSpan Health Services (TriSpan) calculated Medicare outlier and per diem payments to Synergy Behavioral Health (Synergy) in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TriSpan did not calculate Medicare outlier and per diem payments to Synergy in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp;In calculating outlier payments, TriSpan (1) used incorrect cost report information to compute Synergy&rsquo;s cost-to-charge ratio, and (2) incorrectly entered the ratio in the outpatient provider-specific file within the claim-processing system.&nbsp;In calculating per diem payments, TriSpan assigned the wrong geographic wage index factor to Synergy.</p>
<p>We recommended that TriSpan:&nbsp;(1) recover from Synergy improper outlier and per diem payments totaling $8,193,433; (2) review claims with dates of service subsequent to our audit period to ensure that they were paid in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements and make any necessary financial adjustments; and (3) implement internal controls to ensure that future outlier and per diem payments are calculated with the correct cost-to-charge ratio, effective date, and wage index factor.&nbsp;In its comments on our draft report, TriSpan did not agree with most of the findings, the cause, or the first and last recommendations.&nbsp;However, TriSpan agreed that by using the Medicare charges on a particular cost report worksheet, it computed a higher cost-to-charge ratio that resulted in larger outlier payments.&nbsp;TriSpan also agree that it had assigned the wrong geographic wage index factor to Synergy.</p>
