<h2>09-07-2011<br />
Results of Limited Scope Review at United Community Action Program, Inc. 
</h2>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>We reviewed the financial condition of United Community Action Program, Inc. (United), which operates in Oklahoma, as part of a nationwide series of reviews of Community Action Agencies that have received funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. </p>
<p>Based on our assessment, United has the ability to manage and account for Federal funds and is capable of operating a CSBG program in accordance with Federal regulations.  However, United had weaknesses related to its use of Recovery Act funds, financial systems, segregation of physical inventory duties, computer security, board of directors, Recovery Act reporting, and accounting policies and procedures. </p>
<p>We recommended that the Administration for Children & Families consider the information presented in this report in assessing United's ability to operate a CSBG program in accordance with Federal regulations.  United concurred with several of our findings and described actions it had taken to address them.  However, United did not concur with our findings related to its use of Recovery Act funds, its board of directors, and its accounting policies and procedures. </p>
