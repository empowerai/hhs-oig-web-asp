<strong>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of the OIG review of the
  consolidation of University Hospital (University) and the Medical Center of
  Louisiana at New Orleans (MCLNO).&nbsp; The objective of the review was to
  determine whether Medicare’s regulations, especially those dealing with a change
  of ownership, were adhered to when the hospitals consolidated to form the MCLNO
  East and West Campuses.&nbsp; A consolidation of hospitals is a change of ownership
  in Medicare regulations.&nbsp; These regulations require that Medicare payments
  for services to patients, who are discharged after the date of the consolidation,
  be made to the legal owner on the date of discharge.&nbsp; After consolidation,
  MCLNO was not only the legal owner, but also the hospital surviving the consolidation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The
    MCLNO’s consolidation with University was effective July 1, 1994.&nbsp; The&nbsp; University’s
    Medicare provider number was improperly used to submit Medicare claims to
    TriSpan for payment after that date.&nbsp; This, along with other claims
    errors, resulted in $1,811,781 of Medicare overpayments.&nbsp; We recommended
    that TriSpan and the hospitals work together to make the required adjustments
    to the appropriate Medicare claims and cost reports for the errors identified.&nbsp; In
    their written response to our draft report, TriSpan officials stated that
the recovery related to the consolidation was being pursued.</p>
