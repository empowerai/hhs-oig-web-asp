<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Based on a statistical sample, we estimated that the Texas
    Department of Human Services (Department) made incorrect Medicaid payments of at least $12,879 during the period January
    1, 2001 through June 30, 2001 on behalf of dual eligible individuals which included payments for regular nursing and
    Medicare co-insurance.&nbsp; Medicaid overpayments occurred because nursing facilities failed to send the appropriate
    Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF) admission and discharge information to the Department.&nbsp; We are recommending
    that the Department refund $7,801, which is the Federal share of our estimate of at least $12,879 in overpayment; strengthen
    controls concerning the accuracy of the SNF admission and discharge information; and work with the&nbsp; Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services to prevent incorrect payments.</p>
