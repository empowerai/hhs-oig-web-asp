<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The Medicare system for reimbursing teaching hospitals for graduate medical education
  (GME) costs uses a formula approach based on each hospital's average GME cost per
  physician intern and resident for a designated base year. Our audit was made to
  determine whether Medicare's fiscal intermediaries (FI) have adequately audited
  the GME costs and resident counts for the base year, and correctly established
  each hospital's average GME costs per resident. We found significant problems with
  the FI audits involving the accuracy of resident counts. As a result, we recommended
  in individual reports to the FIs recovery of $14.4 million for past years. In this
  final report we are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration
  (1) direct its FIs to emphasize in future audits of the payment years the accuracy
  of the FTE resident counts, (2) monitor the effectiveness of these audits, and
  (3) consider analyzing and comparing GME payments under the new payment methodology
  with actual GME costs, as part of its oversight responsibilities. </p>
