<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether outpatient observation 
  services billed by the Baptist Health System (Hospital) met Medicare reimbursement 
  requirements.&nbsp; Our review covered service dates between September 1, 1995 
  - August 31, 1999.&nbsp; The Hospital billed Medicare for observation services 
  that did not meet Medicare criteria.&nbsp; However, prior to the completion 
  of our audit, fiscal intermediary officials made adjustments of approximately 
  $3 million in observation charges to the Hospital's cost reports for fiscal 
  years 1996 through 1999.&nbsp; The adjustments made by the fiscal intermediary 
  offset any adjustments resulting from our audit.&nbsp; Because of the adjustments 
  we are making no financial recommendations.&nbsp; The fiscal intermediary concurred 
  with our procedural recommendations.</p>
