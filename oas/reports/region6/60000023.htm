<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that significant savings could be realized on prescription
  drugs reimbursed by States under the Medicaid program.&nbsp; Most States use average
  wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies
  for brand name drug prescriptions.&nbsp; This discount averaged about 10.31 percent
  nationally in 1999. We believe it is not a sufficient discount to ensure that reasonable
  prices are paid for drugs. Our review of pricing information from 216 pharmacies
  in 8 States estimated that pharmacy actual acquisition cost nationwide averaged
  21.84 percent below AWP in 1999. For the 200 brand name drugs with the greatest
  amount of Medicaid reimbursement in 1999 we calculated that as much as $1.08 billion
  could have been saved if reimbursement had been based on a 21.84 percent average
  discount from AWP. Our review was limited to ingredient acquisition costs and did
  not address other areas such as the cost of dispensing the drugs. Generally, States
  pay retail pharmacies for their dispensing action separately from the reimbursement
  for the prescription drug. We recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
  Services (CMS) require the States to bring pharmacy drug reimbursement more in
  line with the actual acquisition cost of brand name drugs. The CMS agreed that
  an accurate acquisition cost should be used to determine drug reimbursement and
  will encourage States to review their estimates of acquisition costs in light of
  our findings.</p>
