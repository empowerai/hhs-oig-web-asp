<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Previous OIG reports estimated the discounts below average wholesale price 
  (AWP) commonly available to pharmacy purchasers of brand name drugs and generic 
  drugs. This current review follows up and expands on that work. Our current 
  review found that there is a wide range of discounts from AWP for pharmacy purchases 
  depending on the category of drug that is being purchased. Specifically, we 
  found that pharmacies purchased single source innovator drugs at an estimated 
  discount of 17.2 percent below AWP, all drugs without federal upper limits (FULs) 
  at an estimated discount of 27.2 percent below AWP, multiple source drugs without 
  FULs at an estimated discount of 44.2 percent below AWP, and multiple source 
  drugs with FULs at an estimated discount of 72.1 percent below AWP.</p>
<p>Based on our analysis, if states continue to use a reimbursement system based 
  on AWP, they should consider using a four-tiered reimbursement methodology. 
  This four-tiered system would consist of (1) <b>tier one </b>- a percentage 
  discount off AWP for single source brand name drugs, (2) <b>tier two </b>- a 
  percentage discount off AWP for innovator multiple source drugs without FULs, 
  (3) <b>tier three </b>- a percentage discount off AWP for non-innovator multiple 
  source drugs without FULs, and (4) <b>tier four </b>- the FUL price for FUL 
  multiple source drugs. We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
  Services (CMS) encourage states to consider adopting a four-tiered payment system 
  in order to bring pharmacy reimbursement more in line with the actual acquisition 
  cost of drug products. We also recommended that CMS share this report with the 
  states. The CMS concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
