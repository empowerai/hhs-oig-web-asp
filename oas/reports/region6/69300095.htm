<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report provides the results of work on hospital transfer recovery projects.
  The projects were undertaken jointly by the Office of Inspector General, Health
  Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and Medicare fiscal intermediaries. The projects
  identified overpayments that occurred because transfers of patients between PPS
  hospitals were erroneously reported and paid as discharges. In total, these projects
  resulted in Medicare Part A trust fund recoveries totaling $219 million and annual
  savings totaling $8 million. In addition, we estimate that $22 million will be
  recovered from transfer transactions that warrant further resolution. We recommended
  that HCFA place a high priority on recovering the remaining overpayments. The HCFA
  concurred and will issue a memorandum to all Associate Regional Administrators
  advising them to instruct their fiscal intermediaries to comply with the OIG's
  recommendations and take immediate steps to complete the recovery project. </p>
