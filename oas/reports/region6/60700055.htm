<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of the 147 high-dollar  
payments ($200,000 or more) that TrailBlazer Health Enterprises (TrailBlazer) made 
to Medicare Part A providers in calendar year 2003, 11 were 
overpayments, 8 of which resulted in net overpayments totaling $50,044. &nbsp;<span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal">For 
the remaining three overpayments, providers agreed that they had submitted 
incorrect claims and said that they would submit revised claims</span></span>. 
&nbsp;TrailBlazer is a fiscal intermediary serving 
Medicare providers in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that TrailBlazer (1) <span class="address">
<span style="font-weight: normal">ensure that identified overpayments have been 
recovered, (2) follow up with the providers about the three claims that had not 
been revised, (3) use the results of this audit in its provider education 
activities, and (4) consider identifying and recovering any additional 
overpayments made for high-dollar Part A inpatient claims paid after calendar 
year 2003.&nbsp; TrailBlazer</span></span> 
agreed with our findings and 
stated that providers had corrected and resubmitted 10 of the 11 claims.</p>
