<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Anadarko Indian Health Center (Anadarko) complied with applicable requirements to secure and account for its Schedule II substances.</p>
<p>Anadarko did not always comply with applicable requirements to secure, or have adequate internal controls over, Schedule II substances at its pharmacy.&nbsp;Anadarko appropriately accounted for the Schedule II substances in our review.&nbsp;However, inadequate security and internal controls over these substances made them vulnerable to theft and mismanagement.</p>
<p>We recommend that IHS direct Anadarko to enforce the security and internal controls detailed in our report.</p>
<p>IHS concurred with our findings and recommendations and stated that Anadarko had implemented, or was currently implementing, all recommended corrective actions.</p>
