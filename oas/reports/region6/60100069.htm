<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Recent legislation increased disproportionate share hospital 
  (DSH) reimbursement from 100 percent to 175 percent of uncompensated care costs. 
  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates this will increase 
  Federal spending by $380 million over fiscal years 2003 through 2005. This final 
  report points out that the increase in reimbursement may not be warranted. Recent 
  and ongoing audits have shown that the DSH funds are not always actually going 
  to public hospitals, are not being retained by the public hospitals, are being 
  returned by the hospitals to the State for other uses, and are not always calculated 
  correctly. Among other things, we recommended that CMS seek legislation to at 
  least delay, if not repeal, the implementation of the increase in DSH payments 
  until the need for and use of DSH funds for actual direct care of uninsured 
  patients can be sufficiently reviewed. Further, we recommend CMS consider seeking 
  legislative reform to ensure that DSH funds remain at the hospitals to provide 
  care to vulnerable populations, rather than being returned to the State for 
  other uses. The CMS concurred with our recommendations.</p>
