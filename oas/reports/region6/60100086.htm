<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of the Administration
    for Children and Families' (ACF) grant (09CY2073) to the Huckleberry Youth Programs
    for its Huckleberry House (HH) Basic Center for Runaway and Homeless Youth. This
    grant covered the 3-year period September 1, 1997 through August 31, 2000. The
    objectives of the audit were to determine if HH achieved the grant objectives,
    complied with standard terms and conditions of the grant, and maintained a system
    of accounting and internal controls capable of managing Federal funds. The HH
    was able to achieve all objectives of the Basic Center for Runaway and Homeless
    Youth grant. In addition, HH is generally able to manage and account for Federal
    funds. However, there were some weaknesses in internal controls and compliance
    with the terms and conditions of the grant. We recommended that HH refund $2,783
    to the Federal Government for costs allocated to the grant that were not in accordance
    with the terms and conditions of the grant or were unallowable by Federal regulation.
    In addition, we recommended that HH develop and implement policies and procedures
    to strengthen its internal controls. </p>
