<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report is one of a series of reports involving our multi-state initiative
    focusing on claims to Medicaid for residents of institutions for mental diseases (IMD).&nbsp; The objective of the review
    was to determine if controls were in place to preclude the Texas department of Health from claiming Federal financial
    participation under the Medicaid program for medical services, except inpatient psychiatric services, provided to IMD
    residents under the age of 21.&nbsp; We found that, for the period September 1, 1997 through August 31, 2000, the Texas
    Department of Health improperly claimed Federal funds for medical services provided to IMD residents under the age of
    21.&nbsp; As a result, Federal funding totaling $1,290,047 was improperly claimed.&nbsp; Texas Department of health officials
    disclosed that there were neither edits nor mechanisms within its fiscal agent's Medicaid Management Information System
    to detect and prevent this problem.&nbsp; In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended the implementation of
    appropriate edits and other procedural corrections.</p>
