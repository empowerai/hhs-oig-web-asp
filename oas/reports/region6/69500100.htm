<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report of Medicaid clinical laboratory services in Utah for Calendar Years
  (CY) 1993 and 1994 was conducted by the Utah State Auditor (USA). The objective
  of the review was to determine the adequacy of the Utah Department of Health's
  (UDH) procedures and controls over the processing of Medicaid payments to providers
  of certain clinical laboratory services. </p>
<p>This work was conducted as part of our partnership efforts with State Auditors
  to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program. As part of the review, the Office
  of Audit Services assisted the USA by (1) providing guidance for identifying, through
  computer applications, a universe of potentially overpaid claims resulting from
  certain chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests that were improperly grouped
  or duplicative of each other; (2) selecting a statistical sample of claims for
  the USA to validate the payments; and (3) appraising the sample results for the
  USA to report the estimated overpayments made. In addition, we have performed sufficient
  work to satisfy ourselves that the attached USA audit report can be relied upon
  and used by Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in meeting its program
  oversight responsibilities. </p>
<p>The USA determined that UDH did not have adequate controls to ensure Medicaid
  reimbursements for clinical laboratory tests did not exceed amounts recognized
  by Medicare for the same tests, The USA estimates that UDH reimbursed providers
  for potential overpayments totaling $319,972 (Federal share $239,329) in CYs 1993
  and 1994. The USA further determined the overpayments occurred because the UDH
  has not issued information regarding bundling procedures to providers and does
  not have edit checks built into the computer programs to detect improper payments. </p>
<p>The USA recommended that the State agency: (1) provide providers information regarding
  bundling procedures; (2) implement edit checks to allow for only properly bundled
  tests to be paid; (3) determine if physicians ordered hematology indices; (4) consider
  adopting policies and procedures to prevent payment of unnecessary indices charges;
  (5) establish controls to prevent laboratory payments from exceeding Medicare rates;
  and (6) recover overpayments from at least the providers with the largest payment
  errors and make adjustments for the Federal share of amounts recovered on the Quarterly
  Report of Expenditures to HCFA. </p>
<p>As we do with all audit reports developed by nonfederal auditors, we provided
  a listing of the coded recommendations for use in working with the State to resolve
  findings and recommendations through our stewardship program. </p>
<p>We plan to share this report with other States to encourage their participation
  in our partnership efforts. </p>
