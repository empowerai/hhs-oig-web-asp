<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p>This review was 
part of a multistate audit.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether Louisiana 
(the State) reported Medicaid provider reclaiming adjustments and overpayment 
adjustments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State did not report all Medicaid provider reclaiming 
adjustments and overpayment adjustments in accordance with Federal requirements. 
Fourteen of the 18 reclaiming adjustments that we reviewed, totaling $1,137,456 
($836,391 Federal share), were improper. &nbsp;In addition, the State did not report 
seven overpayment adjustments totaling approximately $4.03 million ($2.87 
million Federal share) on the Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for 
the Medical Assistance Program, Form CMS-64 report&nbsp; (CMS-64s) for the quarters 
in which the 60-day discovery periods ended. &nbsp;This resulted in a potentially 
higher interest expense to the Federal Government of approximately $12,419.</p>






<p>We 
recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Federal Government $836,391 in 
improper reclaiming adjustments; (2) revise reporting and writeoff procedures to 
ensure that improper reclaiming adjustments are not included on the CMS-64; (3) 
revise written policies and procedures to ensure that future overpayments are 
reported timely on the CMS-64s, thereby 
mitigating the potentially higher interest expense to the Federal Government; 
and (4) establish and implement written policies and procedures, and monitor new 
policies and procedures already implemented by the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, 
to ensure coordination among all responsible State offices so that future 
reclaiming adjustments and overpayment adjustments are reported in accordance 
with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State disagreed with our findings that it did 
not report 14 of the 18 overpayment reclaiming adjustments  and asserted that the recommended 
refund of $836,391 should be reduced.&nbsp; It agreed with the remaining recommendations.</p>
