<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:#000080">Of the 382 payments of $10,000 or 
more (high-dollar payments) that TrailBlazer Health Enterprises (TrailBlazer) 
made to providers in 2003, 270 were appropriate.&nbsp; TrailBlazer was the Medicare 
Part B carrier for about 65,000 providers in Texas, Delaware, the District of 
Columbia, Maryland, and parts of Virginia.&nbsp; </span><font color="#000080">TrailBlazer incorrectly paid 
providers for 103 of the remaining claims, which resulted in net overpayments totaling $236,523.&nbsp; 
Also, providers were unable to locate any records for the beneficiaries on three 
claims totaling $46,903.&nbsp; We were unable to determine whether five claims were 
paid correctly based on available information and did not review one claim 
because the provider had filed for bankruptcy.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We recommended that TrailBlazer (1)<span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal"> 
ensure that identified net overpayments totaling $</span></span>236,523<span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal"> 
have been recovered (2) recover $46,903 for the three unsupported claims (3) 
identify and recover any overpayments related to system pricing errors (4) 
review internal controls related to updating system pricing for procedure codes 
(5) review internal controls related to manual processing and claim adjustment 
and (6) use the results of this audit in its provider education activities.</span></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">TrailBlazer agreed with the 
majority of our findings.&nbsp; For one finding, TrailBlazer agreed
<span style="font-family: Times New \(W1\)">that the error had occurred but 
disagreed that it had affected all of the claims processed.&nbsp; TrailBlazer also 
disagreed with some of our calculations of overpayment amounts.</span></font></p>
