<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Conrad and Associates, L.L.P., certified public accountants, under contract 
  with HHS/OIG, performed a financial and compliance audit of expenditures claimed 
  by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (BCBS) related to administration of the Medicare 
  Part A and Part B programs for the period October 1, 1998 through September 
  30, 1999.&nbsp; BCBS was unable to provide supporting documentation for various 
  transactions selected for testing.&nbsp; As a result, expenditures totaling 
  $458,377 were not adequately supported.&nbsp; The self funded insurance program 
  costs were overstated by $528,745.&nbsp; BCBS imputed $820,796 as an expense 
  to the Final Administrative Cost Proposals for return on investment.&nbsp; The 
  contractor used facilities capital employed as its base in applying the cost 
  of money rate in calculating the expense.&nbsp; However, documentation of facilities 
  capital employed was not maintained or provided for our review.&nbsp; BCBS did 
  not dispute the questioned costs as presented but reserved the right to comment 
  on this issue at a later point in time.&nbsp; BCBS stated that the use of depreciation 
  expense does not reflect the asset acquisition or disposals that have an effect 
  on the return on investment computation.</p>
