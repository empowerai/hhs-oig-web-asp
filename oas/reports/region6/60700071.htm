<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of New Mexico’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that the State had implemented the recommendations from 
our prior audit that related to devoting more resources to the drug rebate 
program and implementing a sufficiently detailed accounts receivable system.&nbsp; Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid 
funding by entering into a rebate agreement with the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services (CMS) and paying quarterly rebates to the States.<br>
<br>
We also 
found that the State had partially implemented the recommendations that related 
	to interest,<b><span style="color:red"> </span></b>dispute resolution,<b><span style="color:red">
</span></b>and Form CMS-64.9R reconciliation; had not implement the recommendation related to 
	segregation of duties for the receipt of drug rebate funds; and had established controls over collecting rebates for 
	single-source drugs administered by physicians.<b><span style="color: red">
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State update accounts 
receivable data from January 1991 through February 2007 and attempt to recover 
any unpaid rebate balances, including interest, and follow procedures to 
reconcile all amounts reported on the Form CMS-64.9R to its accounts receivable 
records. &nbsp;We also reiterated our recommendation that the State implement 
policies, procedures, and controls to segregate duties for the receipt of drug 
rebate funds.<b> &nbsp;</b>In comments on the draft report,<b> </b>the State agency 
described how it was addressing the recommendations.</p>
