<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Health Care Financing
  Administration's (HCFA) policies regarding reimbursement for drugs used with durable
  medical equipment (DME). We believe that HCFA's policy for paying for self-administered
  outpatient prescription drugs used in conjunction with DME lacks clear legislative
  authority. Also, HCFA does not have specific pricing policies for the payment of
  drugs used with DME. Consequently, there was no assurance that in calendar year
  1992 about $43.9 million of the total payments of $57.4 million for self-administered
  outpatient drugs used with DME were properly priced and paid. We recommended that
  HCFA: (1) seek legislation to expressly authorize the coverage of drugs used with
  DME, and (2) fully implement policies and procedures at the carriers to ensure
  that such drugs are properly priced and paid. </p>
