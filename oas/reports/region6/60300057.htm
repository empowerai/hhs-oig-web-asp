<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether:&nbsp; (1) the
    Texas Department of Health properly recorded, summarized and reported Public Health Preparedness and Response for Bioterrorism
    Program costs by specific focus area designated in cooperative agreements; (2) program funding supplanted programs previously
    provided by other organizational sources; and (3) the Department of Health had established controls and procedures to
    monitor subrecipients’ expenditures of program funds.&nbsp; We noted one problem.&nbsp; At the start of 2003, Department
    of Health officials identified a problem with the payroll allocation that, if not corrected, could affect the accuracy
    of the year 3 financial status report due November 30, 2003.&nbsp; Officials at the Department of Health stated they
    should have the problem corrected in the next 2 or 3 months.</p>
