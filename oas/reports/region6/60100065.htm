<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Mississippi&#146;s 
  Division of Family and Children&#146;s Services&#146; (DFCS) participation in 
  Title IV-B, Subpart 2 Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program in fiscal years 
  (FY) 1994 through 1999.&nbsp; The objectives of our review were to determine: 
  (1) the reasons why DFCS did not use all Federal funds for the Promoting Safe 
  and Stable Families Program and (2) if DFCS met its cost sharing requirements. 
  The DFCS did not use $6,189,400 in grant awards from FYs 1994 through 1999 because 
  State funds were not available for matching. However, based on the information 
  provided by DFCS officials, we determined that DFCS met its 25 percent State 
  cost match requirement for the Federal funds it expended during FYs 1994 thrtough 
  1999.&nbsp; The DFCS concurred in general with the results, validity and reasonableness 
  of the facts presented.</p>
