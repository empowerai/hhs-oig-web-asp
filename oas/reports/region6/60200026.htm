<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if controls were in place to 
  effectively preclude the Texas Department of Health (TDH) from claiming federal 
  financial participation (FFP) under the Medicaid program for all medical services 
  made on behalf of 21 to 64 year old residents of private psychiatric hospitals 
  that are institutions for mental diseases (IMD).&nbsp; We found that for the 
  period September 1, 1997 through August 31, 2000, TDH improperly claimed FFP 
  for medical and ancillary services for IMD clients between the ages of 22 to 
  64, and those aged 21 at admission.&nbsp; As a result, FFP totaling $555,341 
  was improperly claimed for IMD residents at the 27 private psychiatric hospitals 
  included in our audit.&nbsp; In addition to the implementation of effective 
  internal controls, we recommended a financial adjustment for $555,341.</p>
