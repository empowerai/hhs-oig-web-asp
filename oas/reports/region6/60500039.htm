<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>This review was part of a multistate audit.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether
  the State reported Medicaid provider overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; During
  our audit period, we found that the State did not report $313,538 ($238,928 Federal share)
  in provider overpayments and did not report $229,657 ($175,581 Federal share) in provider
  overpayments in a timely manner.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) include unreported
  overpayments totaling $313,538 on the CMS-64 and refund to the Federal Government the $238,928
  Federal share; and (2) strengthen policies and procedures to ensure all future overpayments
  are reported in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agreed with our recommendations.</p>
