<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare payments for 
  services provided to incarcerated beneficiaries in Texas during&nbsp; the period 
  January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with Federal regulations 
  and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&nbsp; guidelines. We 
  reviewed a randomly selected statistical sample of 100 claims.&nbsp; Payment 
  for 90 of the 100 claims were allowable.&nbsp; However, we found that Medicare 
  payments for five claims were improper because, at the time the service was 
  provided, the five beneficiaries came under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department 
  of Criminal Justice or local jurisdictions. The State of Texas or the local 
  government was responsible for their health needs. We were unable to determine 
  the exact whereabouts of five beneficiaries at the time the services were rendered 
  for the remaining five claims.&nbsp; Therefore, we could not determine Medicare 
  allowability.&nbsp; CMS plans to establish an edit in its Common Working File 
  (CWF) that will deny claims for incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; We believe 
  the planned edit will prevent many improper payments for claims of incarcerated 
  beneficiaries. However, we believe CMS and its contractors will need to educate 
  suppliers and providers on the proper use of the modifier or condition code. 
  Also, claims with the modifier or condition code must be monitored to assure 
  the conditions under regulations at 42 CFR 411.4 (b) required for payment are, 
  indeed, being met. In their written response to our draft report, CMS officials 
  agreed with the findings and recommendations and stated they will work with 
  the contractors in Region VI to ensure that our recommendations are carried 
  out properly. </p>
