<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Grant No. 90RN0015, a discretionary grant awarded by the U.S. Department
  of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families.&nbsp; Asian Counseling &amp; Referral Services
  (ACRS), was awarded a $450,000 grant for the project period from September 30, 1997 through September 29, 2000, $150,000
  for each of the 3 years of the period.&nbsp; The grant was awarded to provide refugee assistance that included citizenship
  classes, help with completion of naturalization applications, and referral services.&nbsp; The objective of our audit was
  to determine if the ACRS accomplished the objectives of the grant.&nbsp; The ACRS did not achieve the results planned for
  the 3-year project period.&nbsp; Additionally, we were unable to verify the accomplishments that were reported because
  ACRS neither effectively maintained supporting records nor adequately monitored its subrecipients.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the ACRS improve its record keeping procedures and more closely monitor its subrecipients.&nbsp; The ACRS concurred
  with our recommendations.</p>
