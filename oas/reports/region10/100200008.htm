<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether medical
  assistance costs claimed by Washington State (State) for the school-based health
  services program were allowable and adequately supported.&nbsp; We found the
  State did not adequately implement and monitor the program.&nbsp; As a result,
  we determined the State submitted claims for unallowable costs for:&nbsp; (1)
  services that were not covered under Medicaid or properly documented ($3,818,252);
  (2) billing fees that were not reimbursable ($573,728); and (3) services provided
  to children who were not Medicaid eligible ($15,819).&nbsp; Based on a projection
  of a statistical sample, we estimated the errors to total at least $4,407,799
  ($2,279,752 Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended procedural improvements and
  a financial adjustment for $2,279,752.</p>
