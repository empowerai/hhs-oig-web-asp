<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the Center for 
Living and Working, Inc., (the Center) claimed personal care services in 
accordance with Medicaid rules and regulations.&nbsp; The Center did not always claim 
personal care services in accordance with Medicaid rules and regulations from 
October 2003 through September 2005.&nbsp; From our sample of reimbursed claims for 
100 beneficiary payment years, we found errors totaling $20,552 ($10,704 Federal 
share) for services that were provided by personal-care attendants on dates when 
the beneficiaries were hospital inpatient<a name="tm_268435869">s</a> and for 
services that were either insufficiently documented or unauthorized.&nbsp; Based on 
the sample results, we estimate that the Center received overpayments of 
$493,777 ($256,366 Federal share).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the Center refund to the State agency 
$493,777 ($256,366 Federal share) and strengthen procedures to ensure that it 
claims personal care services in accordance with Medicaid rules and 
regulations.&nbsp; The Center disagreed in part with our findings and 
recommendations.</p>
