<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="left" style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">The objective of our review 
was to determine whether </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Catholic 
Medical Center (the Hospital) </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">submitted </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">inpatient rehabilitation 
facility (IRF)</span> <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">
claims that met Medicare requirements.<br>
<br>
</span>The Hospital submitted numerous IRF claims that did not meet Medicare 
requirements.&nbsp; For 44 of the 100 claims in our sample, an IRF was not the 
appropriate setting for the beneficiaries.&nbsp; Based on the sample results, we 
estimate that Medicare overpaid the Hospital approximately $1.7 million for IRF 
claims during 2003.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the Hospital refund to the Medicare program the $1.7 million 
estimated overpayment for 2003; identify and refund any overpayments for 
subsequent years’ IRF claims that did not meet Medicare requirements; and 
strengthen its preadmission screening procedures to provide reasonable assurance 
that beneficiaries who are admitted for IRF services require treatment at the 
IRF level of care, are capable of significant practical improvement, and are 
able to participate in intensive rehabilitation.&nbsp; The Hospital strongly objected 
to our findings and recommendations.</p>
