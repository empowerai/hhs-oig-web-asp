<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Virginia Mason Medical Center’s (the Medical Center)
  outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed to Medicare in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; Our
  review of 34 outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) claims found that
  the Medical Center incorrectly billed Medicare on 30 claims.&nbsp; The billing errors included both overpayments and underpayments.&nbsp; Twenty-six
  claims were overpaid by $55,143 and four claims were underpaid by $10,512, resulting in a net overpayment of $44,631.&nbsp; The
  billing errors occurred because the Medical Center did not correctly implement the OPPS requirements when billing Medicare
  for outpatient services.&nbsp; We recommended that the Medical Center (1) strengthen its billing procedures, (2) resubmit
  the claims found to be in error to the fiscal intermediary (FI) for adjustments, and (3) perform an internal review of
  OPPS outlier claims for services rendered during the period August 1, 2000 through March 31, 2002 and resubmit the claims
  to the FI for adjustments, as applicable.&nbsp; The Medical Center generally concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
