<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<P><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Our objective 
was to determine whether Partners Home Care (the agency) complied with Medicare 
requirements in billing for fiscal year 2004 and 2005 services for beneficiaries 
who had been discharged from an acute care hospital in the preceding 14 days. 
&nbsp;The agency improperly coded 231 of these claims as if the beneficiary had not 
had an acute care stay in the preceding 14 days.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services's prepayment edit corrected 155 of the 231 claims.&nbsp; During our 
review, the agency corrected 28 of these claims totaling $13,451.&nbsp; The 48 
remaining unadjusted claims represented overpayments of $16,443.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We recommended 
that the agency ensure that its adjustment for the $13,451 in overpayments for 
the 28 claims was processed by the regional home health intermediary, return the 
$16,443 in overpayments associated with the remaining 48 unadjusted claims to 
the regional home health intermediary, and further educate its staff regarding 
the importance of identifying all facilities that had discharged the beneficiary 
within 14 days of the home health episode and determining which of these 
facilities were acute care (including long term care) hospitals.&nbsp; The agency 
generally agreed with our findings but did not accept responsibility for the 
overpayments.</span></P></BODY></HTML>
