<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a>The objective of our audit was to determine whether 
the National Heritage Insurance Company (NHIC) made inappropriate Part B 
payments for outpatient laboratory services provided to Medicare beneficiaries 
during inpatient stays at prospective payment system hospitals during calendar year (CY) 2005. </a>&nbsp;<a>NHIC made inappropriate Part B payments for these services.&nbsp; Based on 
our statistical sample, we estimate that NHIC paid laboratory suppliers $292,524 
for the technical component of laboratory services provided to hospital 
inpatients during CY 2005.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommend that NHIC recover the $<a>13,101</a> in 
overpayments for the sampled services, review our information on the additional
<a>13,650 services estimated at $279,423<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt">
</span></span></a>and work with the laboratory suppliers to recover any overpayments, <a>
reemphasize to laboratory suppliers the need for internal control systems to 
prevent improper billing,</a> and <a>adjust its existing prepayment edits to 
identify and deny payments for all laboratory services billed with the inpatient 
hospital place of service code</a>.<a>&nbsp; NHIC agreed with our finding and recommendations.</a></p>
