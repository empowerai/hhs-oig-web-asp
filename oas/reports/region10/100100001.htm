<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that Washington made Medicaid 
  disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments in excess of hospital-specific 
  limits and that were not in accordance with the approved state plan. Specifically, 
  the state paid $43.9 million (federal share $23.1 million) in excess of hospital 
  specific limits, and $0.4 million (federal share $0.2 million) to six hospitals 
  not eligible for some DSH programs. This problem occurred because the state 
  did not reconcile DSH payments to actual costs, used billed charge amounts (instead 
  of actual costs) in some calculations, and included unallowable bad debt amounts 
  in its limits calculations. Also, the state did not review hospital eligibility 
  for all DSH programs on an annual basis. We recommended financial adjustments 
  totaling $23.3 million (federal share). We also recommended procedural improvements 
  intended to strengthen the state’s management controls.</p>
