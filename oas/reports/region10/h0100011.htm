<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether administrative expenditures claimed by the Washington State Department
  of Social and Health Services (State) for school-based health services for the period July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000
  (State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2000) were reasonable, allowable, and adequately supported.&nbsp; The final report points out
  that the State did not properly implement and monitor the school-based health services administrative match program.&nbsp; As
  a result, in SFY 2000 the State: (1) claimed $527,102 in Federal financial participation based upon unallowable overhead
  costs for three school districts; (2) utilized non-Medicaid program data to allocate costs between Medicaid and non-Medicaid
  students; and (3) allowed invalid time studies to be used to claim Federal reimbursement. We recommended procedural improvements
  and a financial adjustment of $527,102 for the payments of unallowable overhead costs.</p>
