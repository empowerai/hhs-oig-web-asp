<p>King City Rehab &amp; Living Center (King City) is a nursing facility in Tigard, Oregon operated by Avamere Health Services,
  Inc. (Avamere).&nbsp; For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 (FY 2000), Avamere included $62,394 on the Medicaid cost
  report for King City that was unallowable under Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; These unallowable costs were claimed
  because Avamere did not have adequate policies, procedures, and controls to ensure compliance with Federal and State Medicaid
  program requirements.&nbsp; We recommended that Avamere (1) submit a revised FY 2000 Medicaid cost report, and (2) improve
  existing policies, procedures, and controls to ensure that costs on the Medicaid cost report are allowable, classified
  in the proper accounts, and related to patient care.&nbsp; Avamere concurred with $46,974 of the $62,394 considered unallowable.&nbsp; Also,
  Avamere stated that it did not plan to file an amended cost report but instead would send a copy of the final adjustments
  to the State.</p>
