<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the 
  medical assistance costs claimed by the Oregon State Department of Human Services 
  (Oregon) for the school-based health services direct care program (Program) 
  were allowable and adequately supported.&nbsp; We determined that Oregon:&nbsp; 
  (1) claimed Program expenditures of three educational providers that were unallowable 
  for federal financial participation and (2) established reimbursement rates 
  for group therapies, screenings, and contracted consulting services and rate 
  increases that were not developed in accordance with federal regulations.&nbsp; 
  Based on a statistical sample, we estimated the errors for the three sampled 
  educational providers to be at least $277,688 ($166,671 federal share).&nbsp; 
  We recommended procedural corrections and a financial adjustment totaling $166,671.&nbsp; 
  Oregon concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
