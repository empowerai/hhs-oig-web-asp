<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Providence Health Plans (Providence) complied with Medicare+Choice
  prompt payment regulations to timely pay or deny claims submitted by noncontracted providers during the period September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2002
  through February&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2003.&nbsp; We found that Providence did not comply with prompt payment regulations.&nbsp; Specifically,
  Providence did not (1)&nbsp;pay at least 95&nbsp;percent of clean claims within 30&nbsp;days of receipt, (2)&nbsp;calculate
  and pay interest on clean claims not paid within 30&nbsp;days, and (3)&nbsp;pay or deny all claims within 60&nbsp;days
  of receipt.&nbsp; These conditions occurred because Providence did not implement adequate procedures to (1)&nbsp;pay or
  deny claims in a timely manner and (2)&nbsp;process resubmitted claims.&nbsp; We recommended procedural improvements to
  ensure that &nbsp;at least 95 percent of clean claims are paid within 30 days of receipt, interest is calculated and paid
  on clean claims not paid within 30 days, and &nbsp;all claims are paid or denied within 60 days of receipt.&nbsp; Providence
  concurred with our findings.</p>
