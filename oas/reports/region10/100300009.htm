<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our this review was to determine whether Medicare properly
    reimbursed Salem Hospital (the Hospital) for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; We determined that the
    Hospital met the Medicare cardiac rehabilitation coverage requirements for direct physician supervision although a written
    policy describing the physician’s roles and responsibilities was not established.&nbsp; Further, we found that the Hospital
    did not provide outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services “incident to” a Hospital physician’s professional services.&nbsp; In
    addition, from our specific claims review for a non-statistical sample of 10 beneficiaries who received 107 services
    during Calendar Year 2001, we determined that the Hospital received from Medicare approximately $183, for which the diagnosis
    used to establish the patient’s eligibility for the services was not supported by medical record documentation, or which
    were otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We attributed these questionable services to weaknesses in the Hospital’s internal
    controls and oversight procedures.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital (1) develop written policies and procedures
    regarding physician supervision; (2) work with its Medicare fiscal intermediary regarding the “incident to” requirement;
    (3) work with its Medicare fiscal intermediary to establish the amount of repayment liability, estimated to be as much
    as $183; and (4) bill for initial patient evaluation and orientation services only when performed by a physician.&nbsp; The
Hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
