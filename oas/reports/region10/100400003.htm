<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This review was part of a multistate audit.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether the State reported Medicaid provider overpayments pursuant to Federal requirements.&nbsp; During our audit period, the State did not report Medicaid provider overpayments pursuant to Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State claimed excess Federal reimbursements of $396,941.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund $396,941 for unallowable credit adjustments and unreported interest penalty collections; (2) report overpayments on the basis of draft reports unless there is evidence of abuse; (3) determine whether there were any unreported overpayments, unallowable credit adjustments, or unreported interest penalty collections subsequent to our audit period or extended audit period and refund such amounts; (4) ensure that future overpayments, credit adjustments, and interest penalty collections are reported in accordance with Federal requirements; (5) establish an accounts receivable system that properly records, ages, and reports provider overpayments; and (6) establish and implement written policies and procedures for processing and reporting overpayments, credit adjustments, and interest penalty collections.&nbsp; The State partially agreed with our findings.</p>
