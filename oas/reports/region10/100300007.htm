<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Washington Department
  of Social and Health Services (the State Agency) had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found
  that the State Agency had not established formal policies and procedures over
  the Medicaid drug rebate program as required by Federal rules and regulations.&nbsp; We
  also identified internal control and accountability weaknesses in the State
  Agency’s informal procedures regarding:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;segregation of duties,
  (2) adjustments and write-offs, (3) subsidiary ledger, (4)&nbsp;interest, and
  (5) dispute resolution.&nbsp; As a result, the State Agency did not adequately
  establish policies, procedures, and internal controls to account for drug rebate
  program transactions.&nbsp; In addition, the lack of adequate internal controls
  increased the risk for fraud, waste and abuse of drug rebate program funds.&nbsp; The
  State Agency disagreed with our finding regarding segregation of duties but,
  generally concurred with our other findings.</p>
