<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether Regence supported modifications to its 2001 adjusted community
  rate proposal under the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 and used the additional
  capitation payments in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; Of the capitation payment
  increase in Regence’s revised proposal, about $15.4 million was supported in the proposal’s modifications
  and was used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; However, we found (1) Regence did
  not provide adequate support for approximately $6.8 million in increased payments in the proposal’s
  modifications and we could not determine how much of the amount was used in a manner consistent with
  BIPA requirements and (2) about $0.5 million was supported in the proposal’s modifications but not
  used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; We recommended that Regence (1) work with
  CMS to determine what portion of the about $6.8 million in increased payments was not used in a manner
  consistent with BIPA requirements and refund that amount to the Federal Government (2) refund the about
  $0.5 million to the Federal Government that was not used in a manner consistent with BIPA and (3) ensure
  that all estimated costs in future proposals are properly supported and used in a manner consistent
  with Federal requirements.&nbsp; Regence did not concur with our findings and recommendations.</p>
