<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the administrative expenditures 
  claimed by the Oregon State Department of Health Services, Office of Medical 
  Assistance Programs (Oregon), for school-based health services for the period 
  July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000 (state fiscal year (SFY) 2000) were reasonable, 
  allowable, and adequately supported.&nbsp; We found that Oregon did not properly 
  monitor the school-based health services administrative match program (Program).&nbsp; 
  As a result, in SFY 2000, Oregon:&nbsp; (1) did not ensure that unallowable 
  costs were excluded from claims submitted for Program reimbursement; and (2) 
  allowed invalid time studies to be used to claim federal reimbursement.</p>
<p>However, due to Program reimbursement limits by Oregon, it appears that the 
  unallowable costs were not claimed for federal financial participation.&nbsp; 
  Oregon would have been reimbursed between $3.5 million and $5.3 million in unallowable 
  costs if it had not limited reimbursement for SFY 2000.&nbsp; We recommended 
  that Oregon:&nbsp; (1) ensure Program expenditures are reasonable, allowable, 
  and adequately supported; and (2) ensure time studies are properly conducted 
  and that results are a valid representation of the activities performed.</p>
