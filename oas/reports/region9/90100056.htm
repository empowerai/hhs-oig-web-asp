<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if enhanced Medicare payments
  made to PacifiCare of California (PacifiCare) were appropriate for beneficiaries
  classified as institutionalized in January 1998.&nbsp; We estimate that PacifiCare
  received Medicare overpayments of at least $2,083,163 for beneficiaries incorrectly
  classified as institutionalized in January 1998.&nbsp; We recommended that
  PacifiCare: (1) refund the specific overpayments of $66,658 identified in the
  sample; (2) coordinate with CMS to ensure that adjustments already submitted,
  totaling $8,756, are processed; and (3) review the balance of the institutionalized
  beneficiary universe to identify and refund additional overpayments (total
  overpayments are estimated to be $2,083,163).</p>
