<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out that the California Department of Health Services 
  made Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to Kern Medical 
  Center (KMC) that exceeded by $19.4 million (federal share) the hospital specific 
  limit for DSH payments as mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
  of 1993. This problem occurred primarily because the state:&nbsp; (1) used projected 
  amounts instead of actual expenses and payments, (2) did not limit total operating 
  expenses to amounts that would be allowable under Medicare cost principles, 
  (3) included bad debts as additional operating expenses, and (4) double counted 
  charges for a program and included charges for services provided to inmates 
  and Kern County employees. We recommended financial adjustments and procedural 
  corrections. The state generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
