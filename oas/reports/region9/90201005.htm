<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p> Our follow-up audit found that, for the period 
  reviewed, the STOP AIDS Project, Inc. had generally ensured that all of its 
  AIDS-related materials (including curricula, workshop and event outlines, videos, 
  advertisements and photographs) were reviewed and approved by a local review 
  panel prior to use.&nbsp; For our review period, the Project also substantially 
  complied with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s content guidelines 
  by submitting its AIDS-related educational materials to the San Francisco Department 
  of Public Health (SFDPH) for review and approval.&nbsp; We attribute this compliance 
  to efforts by both the SFDPH-AIDS office and the Project.</p>
<p> We also noted that the Project's new Finance 
  Director installed a software package to track costs by departments and by grants, 
  effective July 1, 2002, and was evaluating alternatives to implement an after-the-fact 
  time and effort reporting system.&nbsp; The Project's comments to our draft 
  report stated that its new time and effort reporting system had been implemented 
  effective October 1, 2002.</p>
