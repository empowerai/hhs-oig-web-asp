<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report points out that the State agency allocated all costs
  incurred under a training contract to Federal programs only, although State
  programs also benefitted. As a result, the State's overclaim of Federal funds
  totaled $3.0 million. Also, the State claimed $0.9 million as in-kind matching
  costs that was improper because the matching funds were actually provided by
  a private third party. However, State officials provided evidence that approval
  had been obtained from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to
  do this, even though the approval was not in accordance with ACF policy. In
  addition to financial adjustments, we recommended procedural improvements to
  correct noted weaknesses. </p>
