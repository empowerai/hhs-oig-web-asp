<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if Alaska properly claimed Federal Medicaid
    reimbursement at the enhanced rate for skilled professional medical personnel for the Federal fiscal year ended September
    30, 2003.&nbsp; Alaska improperly claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement of $758,215 at the enhanced rate for skilled
    professional medical personnel.&nbsp; The costs claimed by Alaska included unallowable costs totaling $233,102 and unsupported
    costs totaling $525,113.&nbsp; The unallowable costs included costs associated with programs that did not require skilled
    professional medical personnel, indirect costs that cannot be claimed at an enhanced rate, and an amount due to a calculation
    error.&nbsp; The unsupported costs included costs associated with personal services that were not supported by adequate
    or approved time reporting methods, and related travel costs.&nbsp; Alaska generally did not concur with our finding
and recommendations.</p>
