<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Arizona claimed enhanced Federal share for managed care family
  planning services pursuant to Medicaid regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; Arizona included an unsupported
  eleven percent component representing the health plans' administration, profit, and contingency expenditures
  in family planning rates used to determine managed care family planning services costs.&nbsp; As a
  result, between October 1999 and September 2002, Arizona increased its claims of family planning services
  costs by $2,273,109.&nbsp; By claiming these costs at the enhanced family planning rate of 90 percent,
  rather than its regular Federal share, Arizona’s claim for Federal reimbursement increased $558,093.</p>
<p>We recommended that the Medicaid agency work with CMS to determine the eligibility of the $558,093
  enhanced Federal share claimed for administration of family planning services and ensure future rates
  used to identify the family planning portion of the capitation payments for claiming enhanced Federal
  share for administrative costs be specifically identified and documented as related to family planning
  services.</p>
