<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Alaska properly
    calculated its reimbursable service expenditures that were claimed as other financial participation on Form CMS-64 for
    the quarter ended June 30, 2003.&nbsp; Contrary to Federal cost principles, Alaska improperly calculated its reimbursable
    service expenditures that were claimed as other financial participation on Form CMS-64.&nbsp; As a result, Alaska improperly
    claimed Federal matching funds of $346,217.&nbsp; Alaska did not discover the calculation error because it did not have
    adequate internal controls to ensure that the claim for Federal matching funds was accurate.&nbsp; We recommended that
    Alaska refund to the Federal Government the Federal matching funds of $346,217 that were improperly claimed as a result
    of the calculation error and develop and implement adequate internal controls to ensure that claims for Federal matching
    funds are properly calculated.&nbsp; Alaska stated that it has already taken corrective action by reporting an adjustment
    on Form CMS-64.&nbsp; Alaska did not address the recommendation that it develop and implement internal controls to ensure
    that claims for Federal matching funds are properly calculated.</p>
