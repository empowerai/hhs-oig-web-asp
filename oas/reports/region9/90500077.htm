<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether PacifiCare of Colorado's (PacifiCare) use of its
  Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increase was
  adequately supported and allowable pursuant to the MMA. &nbsp;Of the $5,148,375 capitation
  payment increase in PacifiCare's revised proposals, $5,013,375 was adequately supported and
  allowable pursuant to the MMA.&nbsp; The remaining $135,000 was adequately supported; however,
  PacifiCare did not use these funds to enhance access to providers under plan 002 as stated
  in its revised proposal.&nbsp; Instead, PacifiCare used the funds to enhance access to providers
  by opening a new medical facility serving beneficiaries enrolled in plans 006 and 007.&nbsp; Since
  plan 002 enrollees did not benefit from the $135,000 of increased capitation payments, PacifiCare's
  use of the payments was unallowable.&nbsp; We recommended that PacifiCare refund to the Federal
  Government $135,000, representing the portion of the MMA payment increase that was not used
  pursuant to the MMA.&nbsp; PacifiCare generally agreed with the facts presented in the report
  but disagreed with the finding and recommendation related to the use of the $135,000.</p>
