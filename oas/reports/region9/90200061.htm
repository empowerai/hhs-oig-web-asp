<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if the state of California had 
  adequate controls to preclude claiming federal financial participation (FFP) 
  under the Medicaid program for inpatient psychiatric services provided to residents 
  who were ages 21 to 64 in private psychiatric hospitals that were IMDs.&nbsp; 
  Federal Medicaid law and regulations prohibit FFP for this care.&nbsp; Our review 
  found that adequate controls were not in place to preclude the state from inappropriately 
  claiming FFP.&nbsp; As a result, during the period of July 1, 1997 through January 
  31, 2001, the state claimed $3,083,389 in unallowable FFP for improper Medicare/Medicaid 
  crossover claims for inpatient psychiatric care.&nbsp; We recommended that the 
  state (1) refund $3,083,389 to the Federal Government; (2) establish controls 
  to prevent FFP from being claimed for IMD residents aged 21 to 64 in private 
  psychiatric hospitals; (3) identify and refund any unallowable FFP claimed for 
  inpatient psychiatric care provided to IMD residents aged 21 to 64 in private 
  psychiatric hospitals subsequent to January 31, 2001, the cut-off date of our 
  audit, and (4) identify and refund any unallowable FFP claimed for inpatient 
  psychiatric care provided to IMD residents aged 21 to 64 in private psychiatric 
  hospitals for the period July 1, 1987 through June 30, 1997.&nbsp; State officials 
  agreed with our audit recommendations.</p>
