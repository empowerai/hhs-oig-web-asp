<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report provides the results of our review of California's
  procedures for ensuring that collections of delinquent child support payments
  were effectively being made under the Federal Tax Refund Offset program. We
  found that the State's procedures were generally adequate for ensuring that
  offsets were being made against Federal tax refunds. However, the State could
  increase recoveries (we estimate about $2.9 million over a 2-year period) and
  the number of cases accepted by the Internal Revenue Service for offset if
  it used available procedures for correcting Social Security numbers. Additionally,
  the State earned $2.1 million (Federal share $1.4 million) of interest on child
  support monies but did not report the interest earned as program income as
  required by Federal regulations. </p>
