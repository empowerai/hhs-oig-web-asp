<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report points out concerns regarding compliance with health and safety
  standards at Native American Head Start facilities. Significant numbers of
  health and safety deficiencies have been reported at Native American Head Start
  facilities. Of 106 facilities for which we reviewed safety inspection reports,
  76 had fire safety problems, 55 had structural integrity concerns, 54 had water
  supply or rest room inadequacies, and 53 were identified with playground deficiencies.
  Recurring, serious deficiencies were reported at 23, or about 22 percent of
  the 106 facilities reviewed. In most instances, health and safety inspections
  were performed by the responsible entities. However, our review disclosed that
  health and safety inspections: were not standardized; were sometimes inconsistent
  with previous inspections of the same facility; were not always performed annually;
  and were conducted by agencies which lacked authority to require correction
  of deficiencies. Officials from the Administration for Children and Families
  generally agreed with our findings. </p>
