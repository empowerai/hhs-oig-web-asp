<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the $183,179,805 (Federal share) of California’s 
Medicaid management information system (MMIS) costs that we reviewed, 
$180,906,594 was allowable.<b>&nbsp; </b>The remaining $2,273,211 consisted of 
$2,009,782 of unallowable costs that were not equitably allocated to all 
benefiting programs, were not related to the Medicaid program, or were claimed 
twice and $263,429 of postage, administrative, and subcontract costs claimed at 
the incorrect reimbursement rate.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund $2,273,211 to the Federal 
Government; (2) strengthen internal controls and procedures to ensure that MMIS 
costs claimed for Federal reimbursement are allowable, equitably allocated to 
all benefiting programs, and claimed at the correct Federal reimbursement rate; 
and (3) review MMIS costs claimed for Federal reimbursement after June 30, 2005, 
to ensure that the costs claimed were allowable, equitably allocated to all 
benefiting programs, and claimed at the correct Federal reimbursement rate.</p>
