<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Grant No. 90RN0002, a discretionary
  grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration
  for Children and Families.&nbsp; Hmong American Women Association, Inc. (Association),
  was awarded a grant for the project period from September 30, 1997 through
  September 29, 2000, in the amount of $480,000, $160,000 for each of the 3 years
  of the project period.&nbsp; The grant was awarded to provide refugee assistance
  that included citizenship classes, help with completion of naturalization applications,
  and referral services.&nbsp; The objective of our audit was to determine if
  the Association accomplished the objectives of the grant.&nbsp; The Association
  accomplished the two primary grant objectives.&nbsp; However, progress reports
  submitted by the Association did not always show the actual accomplishments
  of the grant objectives.&nbsp; We recommended that the Association improve
  its record keeping procedures to ensure that progress reports show the actual
  accomplishment of grant objectives.&nbsp; The Association concurred with our
  recommendation and provided a record-keeping plan.</p>
