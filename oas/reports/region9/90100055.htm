<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p >The objective of this review was to determine if controls 
  were in place to preclude the State of California from claiming Federal financial 
  participation (FFP) under the Medicaid program for residents of institutions 
  for mental diseases (IMD) aged 22 through 64 who were temporarily released to 
  acute care hospitals for medical treatment.&nbsp; Our review found that adequate 
  controls were not in place to preclude the State from inappropriately claiming 
  FFP in such cases.&nbsp; As a result, during the period July 1, 1997 through 
  February 28, 2001, the State claimed $551,394 in unallowable FFP.&nbsp; We recommended 
  that the State (1) refund $551,394 to the Federal Government, and (2) establish 
  controls to prevent FFP from being claimed under the Medicaid program for IMD 
  residents aged 22 through 64 who are temporarily released to general acute care 
  hospitals to receive medical treatment.&nbsp; State officials disagreed with 
  our finding and recommendations.&nbsp; However, Departmental Appeals Board and 
  Federal Court rulings have upheld Office of Inspector General disallowances 
  in such cases in other States.</p>
