<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the Los Angeles County Department of Health
  Services (LA County):&nbsp; (i) properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions in accordance
  with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement, (ii) established controls and procedures to monitor subrecipient
  expenditures of Health Resources and Services Administration funds; and (iii) used Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program
  (Program) funds to supplant funds previously provided by other sources.&nbsp; We determined that LA County:&nbsp; (i) generally
  accounted for Program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement and applicable departmental
  regulations and guidelines, (ii) had not started to monitor subrecipient activities or made any site visits because the
  hospital agreements had been in place only a few months; and (iii) had not used Program funding to supplant existing State
  or local funds.&nbsp; We recommended that LA County implement the monitoring procedures as planned.&nbsp; LA County concurred
  with the conclusions of our report.</p>
