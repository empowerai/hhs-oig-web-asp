<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine if the State reported Medicaid provider overpayments according to Federal
  regulations and adequately performed and documented procedures to support credit adjustments.&nbsp; We found that during
  the period October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, the State did not report Medicaid provider overpayments according
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; Specifically, the State did not report $1,874,978 in overpayments and netted other overpayments
  against expenditures.&nbsp; The State did not properly report overpayments because it did not have adequate policies and
  procedures.&nbsp; As a result, the State did not refund the Federal share of $1,092,663, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
  Services (CMS) is unable to monitor the total amount of overpayments each year.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1)
  report the $1,874,978 in overpayments on the CMS-64, thereby crediting the Federal share of $1,092,663 and (2) establish
  policies and procedures to ensure that all overpayments are reported according to Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State
  agency concurred with our findings and initiated corrective action.</p>
