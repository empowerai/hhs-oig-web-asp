<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p> This report presents the results of our audit
    of the cash management procedures used by the University of Hawaii (UH) to
    determine the interest earned on advances of Federal funds.&nbsp; The objective
    of our audit was to determine whether the UH’s cash management polices and
    procedures were in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
    Circular A-110.&nbsp; We found that the UH did not have the procedures required
    by OMB Circular A-110 to effectively determine its interest earned on advances
    of Federal funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we identified areas where the UH needs
    to improve its cash management, our analysis indicated that the UH did not
    have significant positive cash balances and, therefore,  there
    was no material impact of the UH improperly calculating interest earned during
    our audit period.&nbsp; We recommended that the UH establish written procedures
    on the timing and amount of advance requests and calculate interest earnings
    on advances of Federal funds based on daily positive cash balances.&nbsp; The
    UH concurred with our recommendations. </p>
