<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report presents the results of our audit of administrative costs related
  to training provided to current and prospective employees and claimed for Federal
  reimbursement by the California Department of Social Services (State) under
  title IV-E (Foster Care program) of the Social Security Act. Federal financial
  participation is available at a rate of 75 percent in certain costs of training
  staff employed or preparing for employment by the State or local agency administering
  Foster Care programs. This is an enhanced rate over the 50 percent rate for
  administrative costs necessary for the operation of States' Foster Care programs,
  including administrative costs related to training. The audit covered the period
  July 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995. </p>
<p>The primary objective of our audit was to determine whether the State claimed
  administrative costs related to foster care training at the appropriate rate
  of 50 percent instead of the 75 percent rate allowed for certain training costs
  specified by Federal regulations. </p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CLAIMED AT 75 PERCENT RATE</strong> </p>
<p><strong><u>Inappropriately Claimed Costs.</u></strong> The State inappropriately
  claimed administrative costs related to foster care training at the enhanced
  rate of 75 percent rather than the allowable rate of 50 percent. We identified
  $8.4 million inappropriately claimed at the 75 percent rate, resulting in an
  overclaim of Federal funds totaling $2.1 million. The costs related to county
  welfare departments, probation departments, and State and county contracts
  with universities and did not meet the definition of costs eligible for the
  enhanced rate under Federal regulations for the Foster Care programs. </p>
<p><strong><u>Insufficiently Documented Costs.</u></strong> The State did not
  provide sufficient documentation to support some of the costs that were claimed
  as matching costs to meet the State's cost sharing requirement for certain
  costs claimed at the 75 percent enhanced rate. We identified $3.8 million (Federal
  share $2.8 million) of such inadequately supported costs claimed. In some instances,
  information provided by the State was not sufficient to determine the allowability
  of the costs under Federal regulations; in other instances, the information
  was not sufficient to distinguish between (i) costs related to training activities
  reimbursable at the 75 percent rate, and (ii) costs for administrative activities
  reimbursable at the 50 percent rate. </p>
<p><strong>DUPLICATE COSTS CLAIMED</strong> </p>
<p>In its quarterly statements of expenditures, the State included adjustments
  to costs claimed for Federal reimbursement which resulted in two duplicate
  claims totaling $6.8 million (Federal share $4.5 million). One duplicate claim
  resulted from an apparent lack of understanding on how to claim child welfare
  information system costs that were allowable at the 75 percent rate. This resulted
  in the same costs being claimed under two different cost categories. The other
  duplicate claim resulted from an administrative error which duplicated an earlier
  adjustment for underclaimed costs. </p>
<p>We recommend that the State refund $6.6 million, which includes $2.1 million
  due to the inappropriate use of the 75 percent rate, and $4.5 million resulting
  from the duplication of costs. We also recommend that the State provide documentation
  for the unsupported costs claimed or make an appropriate refund of costs which
  cannot be supported. Our report also includes various procedural recommendations. </p>
<p>The State concurred with the recommended refund of $4.5 million resulting
  in duplicate claims. However, the State did not concur with the recommended
  refund of $2.1 million in administrative costs claimed at the enhanced rate
  of 75 percent or the finding and recommendation relating to the $3.8 million
  (Federal share $2.8 million) of inadequately supported costs set aside. The
  State did not agree that the regulations limited Federal reimbursement of training-related
  administrative costs to 50 percent, and commented that it considered the documentation
  provided in support of the costs claimed to meet its matching requirements
  to be sufficient. </p>
