<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report summarizes the results of our review of a reimbursement
  exception policy made by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for
  new physicians who join medical groups. The Congress provided, effective April
  1, 1988, that the customary charges of first-year physicians be limited to
  80 percent of the prevailing charges of the established physicians in the same
  locality. The Congress subsequently amended the law to cover physicians and
  other health care practitioners in their second, third, and fourth years of
  practice by providing limits of 85, 90, and 95 percent, respectively. The HCFA
  provided for an exception that allowed carriers to use the Medicare group customary
  charges rather than applying the percentage limits to new physicians in the
  groups. We found that the exception policy was not authorized by the Congress
  and that HCFA should not have provided the exception. As a result, intended
  savings may not have been realized. </p>
