<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This 
  audit report presents the results of our review of inpatient hemodialysis procedure 
  services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by East Bay Nephrology Medical Group, 
  Inc. (Group) in Calendar Years 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; Based on a review of a statistical 
  sample of Medicare claims, we are 95 percent confident that the Group received 
  a total overpayment of at least $3,418.&nbsp; We recommended that the Group 
  refund the overpayment to the Medicare program.&nbsp; We also recommended that 
  the Group ensure that its Compliance Manual should be fully followed so that 
  the Medicare requirements for billing hemodialysis procedure services were met 
  before billing Medicare for such services.</p>
