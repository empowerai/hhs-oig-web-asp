<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:navy">The objectives of this audit were 
to determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented the recommendations 
made in our previous audit of the California drug rebate program and (2) 
established controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered 
by physicians.&nbsp; We found that the State agency (1) implemented the prior 
recommendation related to dispute resolution and (2) established controls over 
collecting rebates on 81 single source drugs administered by physicians. 
&nbsp;However, the State agency did not fully implement the previous recommendation 
regarding quarterly reporting. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:navy">We recommended that the State 
agency ensure that the system change scheduled for implementation provides 
documentation to support rebate amounts reported to CMS.&nbsp; In 
written comments on the draft report, the State agency addressed our 
recommendation by stating that it is working on a system change that will enable 
it to capture and document the data to support rebate amounts reported to CMS 
quarterly.&nbsp; The change is scheduled to be implemented by July 15, 2008.</span></p>
