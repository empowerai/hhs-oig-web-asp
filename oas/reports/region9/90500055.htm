<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Garfield Imaging Center LTD (Garfield Imaging) billed Medicare
  for diagnostic services ordered by chiropractors.&nbsp; Contrary to Federal regulations and Medicare
  guidelines, Garfield Imaging billed Medicare for diagnostic services ordered by chiropractors during
  calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003.&nbsp; As a result, Medicare overpaid Garfield Imaging $88,747.<b>&nbsp; </b>Garfield
  Imaging did not have adequate controls to prevent billing Medicare for diagnostic services ordered
  by chiropractors.&nbsp; We recommended that Garfield Imaging refund to the Federal Government $88,747
  in Medicare overpayments identified for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 and strengthen controls
  to ensure that it does not bill Medicare for diagnostic services ordered by chiropractors.&nbsp; Garfield
  Imaging agreed with our finding and recommendations.</p>
