<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of our audit was to examine the Medicare Part B payments for
  services billed by Community Urgent Care Medical Group (Community) for the
  period January 1, 1995 through July 31, 1999 to determine if the payments (about
  $3.7 million) were appropriate.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that 29 services
  in our random, statistical sample of 100 claims (135 services) were overpaid.&nbsp; The
  29 overpaid services included 23 which had been upcoded, 3 for which the documentation
  did not support the services billed, and 3 for which the documentation did
  not support that a teaching physician was present when a resident performed
  the service.&nbsp; Based upon our random sample, we estimate that Community
  received $266,236 in Medicare overpayments during the audit period.&nbsp; We
  are recommending that Community refund the identified overpayment.</p>
