<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report summarizes the results of audits of Migrant and Seasonal
  Farmworker (MSF) program discretionary grants awarded by the Office of Community
  Services (OCS). Audits of 8 grantees involving 10 grants disclosed that seven
  of the eight grantees did not fully accomplish one or more of their program
  objectives; six grantees either: (i) claimed costs that were not allowable
  for reimbursement, (ii) could not document compliance with the matching requirements
  of the grants, (iii) did not report grant related income, or (iv) did not return
  unexpended grant funds; three grantees did not comply with reporting requirements;
  and seven grantees had other management or operating deficiencies. We recommended
  that Administration for Children and Families (ACF) require OCS to: (1) collect
  unallowable costs claimed by grantees; (2) monitor progress reports submitted
  by grantees to ensure that they address major objectives of the grants; (3)
  require project officers to take appropriate action when satisfactory progress
  is not being made to accomplish project objectives; and (4) monitor financial
  reporting to ensure that required reports are submitted in a timely manner,
  and unexpended funds are returned. The ACF agreed with our findings and recommendations. </p>
