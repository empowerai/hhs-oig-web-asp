<p> <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> <br wp="br1" />
  <br wp="br2" />
  This final audit report presents the results of our audit of claims by podiatrists 
  and optometrists for comprehensive nursing facility (CNF) assessments during 
  Calendar Years 1995 through 1998. We found that Florida podiatrists and optometrists 
  inappropriately billed Medicare for CNF assessment services totaling $3,224,389<em> 
  </em>and $68,740, respectively. First Coast paid $1,979,769 and $46,372 for 
  their claims. We made no recommendations because First Coast initiated corrective 
  action prior to the issuance of our report. First Coast issued a reminder to 
  podiatrists and optometrists not to bill for any service they are not licensed 
  to perform, and implemented computer edits to prevent payment of CNF assessments 
  claimed by podiatrists and optometrists. First Coast agreed with the accuracy 
of our report.</p>
