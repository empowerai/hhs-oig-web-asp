<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The California Department of Health Services and the 
Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board (referred to collectively as the State 
agencies) (1) made some State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 
payments on behalf of beneficiaries who did not meet Federal and State 
eligibility requirements and (2) did not always adequately document eligibility 
determinations.&nbsp; Of the 191 payments in the statistical sample, 7 payments 
totaling $259 (Federal share) were unallowable because the beneficiaries were 
ineligible for SCHIP.&nbsp; In addition, for 12 sampled payments totaling $410 
(Federal share), the case files were missing or did not contain adequate 
documentation supporting eligibility determinations.&nbsp;
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">As a result, for the 6-month audit period, 
we estimated that the State agency made </span>between 104,162 and 407,226 
payments totaling between $2,081,901 and $14,248,148 (Federal share) on behalf 
of ineligible beneficiaries<span style="layout-grid-mode:
line">.&nbsp; We also estimated that case file documentation did not adequately 
support eligibility determinations for an additional </span>220,344 to 600,063 
payments totaling between $4,996,337 and $20,829,931 (Federal share).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agencies use the results of 
this review to help ensure compliance with Federal and State SCHIP eligibility 
requirements by (1) reemphasizing to beneficiaries the need to provide accurate 
and timely information and <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">(2)&nbsp;requiring 
employees of </span>MAXIMUS, Inc., <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">and the 
California county government offices to verify eligibility information and 
maintain appropriate documentation in all case files<a name="tm_268447065">.</a>&nbsp; 
The State agencies agreed with the recommendation.</span></p>
