<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p></strong>
<p>The objective of our review of inpatient Medicare bad debts 
  at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (the Hospital) 
  was to determine if Medicare bad debts claimed by the Hospital were in compliance 
  with the Medicare reimbursement criteria.&nbsp; Our review focused on inpatient 
  Medicare bad debts claimed by the Hospital totaling $2,993,138 during the Hospital’s 
  cost report period ending March 31, 2000.&nbsp; Of the $2,993,138 bad debts 
  claimed, a net amount of $2,432,883 did not meet the Medicare reimbursement 
  requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
