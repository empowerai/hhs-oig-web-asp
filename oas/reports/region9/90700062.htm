<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of 
Washington State’s Medicaid drug rebate program, we found that the State had 
implemented the recommendations from our prior audit that related to 
establishing (1) formal policies and procedures for its drug rebate program and 
(2) internal controls for segregation of duties and updating of subsidiary 
ledger accounts.&nbsp; However, the State had not fully implemented the 
recommendations related to management oversight over account adjustments and 
writeoffs, interest verification, and dispute resolution.&nbsp; In addition, the 
State had established controls over and accountability for collecting rebates on 
single-source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; Manufacturers may make their 
outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering into a rebate 
agreement with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and paying quarterly 
rebates to the States.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We reiterated our recommendations that the State implement 
internal controls for management oversight over account adjustments and 
writeoffs, accrue interest to verify the accuracy of interest payments received, 
and actively work to resolve manufacturer disputes.&nbsp; The State described the 
status of actions taken on our recommendations.</p>
