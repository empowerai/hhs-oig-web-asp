<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period October 1, 1998, through March 31, 2006, 
California did not recognize or report program income totaling $2.2 million 
($1.5 million Federal share) for Orange County’s undistributable child support 
collections and interest earned on child support collections.&nbsp; Undistributable 
collections result when a State receives a child support payment but cannot 
identify or locate the custodial parent or return the funds to the noncustodial 
parent.&nbsp; States are required to offset Child Support Enforcement program costs, 
for which they receive Federal matching funds, by recognizing and reporting 
undistributable collections and interest earned on collections as program 
income. &nbsp;The deficiencies occurred primarily because California had not 
sufficiently monitored the county’s unclaimed collections and because the county 
had focused its resources on processing current child support collections.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) monitor the county’s progress in resolving the 
status of unclaimed child support collections and report as program income those 
collections recognized as abandoned, (2) report program income for 
undistributable collections that the county agency already recognized as 
abandoned, and (3) report program income for interest earned on child support 
collections.<a name="tm_268439240"> </a>&nbsp;The State concurred with the findings 
and described how it was addressing the recommendations.</p>
