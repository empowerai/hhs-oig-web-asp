<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Effective December 1, 1996, California Physicians' Service, dba Blue Shield 
  of California (BSC), voluntarily withdrew from the Medicare program as a carrier. 
  During the period December 1, 1996 through November 30, 1997 BSC claimed termination 
  costs totaling $2,813,246. The termination costs charged to Medicare were overstated 
  by $574,615. The overstatement consisted of improperly allocated severance costs, 
  unallowable building reconfiguration costs, unapproved professional fees, and 
  unallowable outplacement services costs. We recommended that BSC reduce its 
  Medicare claim for the $574,615 in overstated costs. </p>
<p>We also set aside building reconfiguration costs of $85,148 for the Health 
  Care Financing Administration's determination because BSC was unable to provide 
  the needed documentation to support that these costs were Medicare related.
