<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>In accordance with an interagency agreement, the Office of Inspector General 
  (OIG) has performed a review of the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) 
  Region IX accounts receivable beginning balance at October 1, 1998 and additional 
  receivable activity for the 6 months ended March 31, 1999. The results of our 
  review will be considered in the preparation of the Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 financial 
  statements for HCFA. </p>
<p>We found that Region IX's accounts receivable were overstated by a net $123.1 
  million, and that financial adjustments and procedural improvements need to 
  be made or else HCFA's FY 1999 financial statements could be misstated. The 
  $123.1 million is the net of total overstatements of $143.2 million offset by 
  $20.1 million of unrecorded transfers from Medicare contractors. </p>
