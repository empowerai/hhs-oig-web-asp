<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">We determined whether the State agency had (1)&nbsp;implemented 
the recommendations made in our previous audit of the Oregon drug rebate program 
and (2) established controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs 
administered by physicians.&nbsp; The State agency did not implement all of the 
recommendations made in our previous audit.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency 
established controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered 
by physicians.&nbsp; However, for the period January 2006 through May 2007, the State 
agency billed using an incorrect crosswalk. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency implement policies, 
procedures, and internal controls to (1) reconcile the ending balance of 
uncollectible rebates to the receivable account and report drug rebates for the 
supplemental program on Form CMS-64.9R (2) create a sufficiently detailed 
subsidiary accounts receivable system to track drug rebate activity by National Drug Code for 
all drug rebate balances (3) verify the accuracy of interest payments received, 
and (4) ensure that the crosswalk is used for collecting rebates for single 
source drugs administered by physicians and bill manufacturers for all drugs 
that were not billed for the period January 2006 through May 2007.&nbsp; The State 
agency concurred with the findings.</p>
