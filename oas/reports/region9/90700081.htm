<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Hawaii’s 
Medicaid drug rebate program, we found that the State had partly implemented the 
recommendation from our prior audit that related to collection of rebate 
interest but had not implemented the recommendations related to accuracy of 
reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and amount of 
the outstanding accounts receivable balance.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency established controls over collecting rebates on single 
source drugs administered by physicians, except that it did not establish a 
crosswalk for single source drugs without National Drug Codes (NDC) on the claim 
form<a name="tm_201332015">s</a>.&nbsp; Manufacturers may 
make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering 
into a rebate agreement with CMS and paying quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) establish written policies and procedures to 
ensure that interest is properly collected on rebate receivable items that were 
outstanding before the transition to the current fiscal agent; (2) establish 
written policies and procedures for preparing Form CMS-64.9R to ensure the 
accuracy of amounts reported to CMS, including drug rebates for the supplemental 
program; (3) determine the amount of the outstanding rebate accounts receivable 
balance before the transition to the current fiscal agent and properly report 
the balance on Form CMS­-64.9R; and (4) establish a crosswalk for collecting 
rebates for single-source drugs administered by physicians for claim forms that 
do not include NDCs. &nbsp;The State did not dispute the findings and provided 
information on the status of corrective actions taken.</p>
