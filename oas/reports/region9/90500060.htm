<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Child Welfare Services Case Management System (CWS/CMS)-related operating costs that Sacramento County (Sacramento) claimed for Title IV-E reimbursement were allowable under Federal and State regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the period January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2003, Sacramento claimed $11,181,417 as CWS/CMS-related operating costs for reimbursement under Title IV-E.&nbsp;We found that $3,984,138 was not allowable under Federal and State regulations, and we could not determine the allowability of the remaining $7,197,279.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that California: (1) refund the $1,992,069 Federal share of the $3,984,138 of unallowable costs claimed, (2) work with the Administration for Children and Families to determine what portion of the $7,197,279 ($3,598,640 Federal share) is allowable for reimbursement under Title IV-E and refund the Federal share of any unallowable costs identified, (3) review costs that Sacramento claimed for reimbursement under Title IV-E subsequent to the audit period for issues similar to those identified and refund the Federal share of any unallowable costs identified, and (4) instruct Sacramento to strengthen its internal controls.</p>
<p>California partly agreed and partly disagreed with our first two recommendations and did not directly comment on our final two recommendations.</p>
