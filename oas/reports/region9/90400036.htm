<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if the California State Department of Health Services (State) had internal
  controls to ensure that costs claimed for the Medicaid Personal Care Services program for the period July 1, 2002, through
  June 30, 2003, were in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; Based on our limited review, we found that the
  State had internal controls to ensure that costs claimed for the Medicaid Personal Care Services program were in accordance
  with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; In addition, the three counties we examined had internal controls to review and
  authorize individual provider time sheets related to personal care services.</p>
