<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that a significant amount of College Hospital's 
  outpatient psychiatric service claims did not meet the Medicare criteria for 
  reimbursement. Specifically, many charges for psychiatric services were either 
  unreasonable or unnecessary for the treatment of the patient's condition, or 
  were not adequately supported by the underlying medical records. Based on a 
  statistical sample, we estimate that for calendar year 1998 at least $567, 888 
  in outpatient psychiatric charges submitted by the Hospital were unallowable. 
  In addition to a financial adjustment, we recommended that the Hospital strengthen 
  its procedures to ensure that charges for outpatient psychiatric services are 
  covered and properly documented in accordance with Medicare requirements. </p>
