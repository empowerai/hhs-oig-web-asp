<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report summarizes the results of audits of specialized service
  funds (recharge centers) at 12 universities. Recharge centers at universities
  operate as in-house enterprises and are used to finance, account for, and report
  on the provision of goods and services to other university operating units.
  Our audits identified a total of $3.2 million in overcharges to the Federal
  Government because universities did not establish or adhere to policies and
  procedures for recharge centers and maintain adequate accounting systems and
  records. We recommended that universities develop and implement policies consistent
  with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements regarding recharge
  centers and that the Department's Division of Cost Policy and Oversight work
  with OMB to revise guidance to ensure that criteria related to the financial
  operation of recharge centers is clear. The Assistant Secretary for Management
  and Budget generally concurred with our recommendations. </p>
