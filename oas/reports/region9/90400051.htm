<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Child Development Resources of Ventura County,
  Inc. (CDR) compensation practices for five executives and Head Start teachers were reasonable and consistent with Federal
  requirements.&nbsp; Four of the five executives were paid more than the average compensation for comparable services in
  the local area, whereas the Head Start teachers were paid less.&nbsp; CDR did not have a current wage comparability study
  and did not use an available nonprofit wage and benefit survey to adjust its executive compensation.&nbsp; Also, CDR did
  not use quality improvement funds awarded by the Federal Government to increase teacher compensation.&nbsp; We recommended
  that CDR:&nbsp; (1) take corrective actions to ensure that executive compensation meets Federal requirements; (2) develop
  written procedures and guidance; (3) improve oversight of quality improvement funds; and (4) ensure that teachers are provided
  salary increases, consistent with Federal requirements.&nbsp; CDR concurred with our recommendations.&nbsp; However, CDR
  disagreed with our finding that it did not have a current wage comparability study, and questioned whether it was reasonable
  for us to compare teacher positions at local area school districts with teacher positions at CDR.</p>
