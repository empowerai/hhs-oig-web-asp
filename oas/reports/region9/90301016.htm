<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the California Department of Health Services (State agency) (i) met
  key service-delivery performance goals and complied with program requirements, (ii) followed applicable cost requirements
  in the expenditure of CARE Act Title II funds and (iii) purchased prescription drugs at the lowest prices available for
  ADAP.&nbsp; We found that the State agency (i) met its key service-delivery performance goals and complied with program
  requirements, (ii) complied with cost requirements in the expenditure of CARE Act Title II funds and (iii) purchased prescription
  drugs at discounted prices.&nbsp; Although the State agency purchased prescription drugs at discounted prices, it did not
  fully use all the rebates received from manufacturers to expand CARE Act Title II program services and activities in a
  timely manner.&nbsp; However, the State agency took corrective action and used $66.8 million of rebate funds for ADAP in
  State fiscal year 2005 and established monitoring procedures to ensure that future rebate funds are identified and used
  for the program in a timely manner.</p>
