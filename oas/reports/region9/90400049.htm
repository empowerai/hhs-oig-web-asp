<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>We conducted this audit as part of a nationwide review.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether
  the California Department of Health Services (California) properly claimed Federal Medicaid funding
  at the enhanced rate for skilled professional medical personnel and their supporting staff for the
  period October 1, 2002, through September 30, 2003. &nbsp;Contrary to Federal regulations, California
  claimed Federal Medicaid funding at the enhanced rate for: (1) overhead costs not eligible for the
  enhanced rate ($4,795,167 Federal share), (2) salaries and other compensation for 43 supporting staff
  not directly supervised by skilled professional medical personnel ($352,532 Federal share), and (3)
  salaries and other compensation for 13 positions not requiring medical expertise ($147,674 Federal
  share).</p>
<p>We recommended that California: (1) refund $5,295,373 for the Federal share of Medicaid overpayments
  for skilled professional medical personnel and their supporting staff; (2) strengthen controls to ensure
  that costs claimed at the enhanced rate for skilled professional medical personnel do not include overhead
  costs, include only supporting staff directly supervised by skilled professional medical personnel,
  and are limited to positions that require medical expertise; and, (3) identify and refund the Federal
  share of Medicaid overpayments for skilled professional medical personnel and their supporting staff
  improperly claimed after September 30, 2003.&nbsp; California provided extensive written comments on
  our draft report, but did not comment on our recommended refund.&nbsp; We made changes in the final
  report to reflect California’s comments.</p>
