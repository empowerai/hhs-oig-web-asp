<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Prior OIG reports found that Medicare rates for rental of semi-electric hospital 
  beds were substantially higher than other payers’ rates. This final report points 
  out that Medicare rates for semi-electric hospital beds remain too high. We 
  found that billing codes of fee schedule amounts were excessive when compared 
  to combinations of other fee schedule amounts that should have been used in 
  many instances. We estimate that the use of two alternative billing code combinations 
  could result in savings of approximately $34.3 million per year, consisting 
  of $25.9 million in rental payments and $8.4 million for maintenance and servicing 
  fees. Moreover, Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid programs, or supplemental insurers 
  could save approximately $8.6 million per year in coinsurance amounts. We recommended 
  that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) either; (1) reimburse 
  for semi-electric hospital beds based on the least costly alternative billing 
  codes, or (2) issue a final rule on the application of CMS’ &quot;inherent reasonableness&quot; 
  authority so that this authority can be used to adjust the fee schedule amounts 
  for these billing codes. The CMS stated a final rule on inherent reasonableness 
  will be published in the near future and indicated it will consider reviewing 
  payments for semi-electric hospital beds.</p>
