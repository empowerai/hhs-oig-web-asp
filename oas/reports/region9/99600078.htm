<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report discloses that Saint Louise Hospital and Health Center's skilled 
  nursing facility (SNF) billed Medicare for ancillary medical supplies that were 
  not in compliance with Medicare's rules and misclassified significant costs 
  on the Medicare cost reports. About 54 percent of the amount billed as ancillary 
  medical supplies and 55 percent of the amount claimed as ancillary medical supply 
  costs in our judgmental samples were for routine medical supplies on the Medicare 
  cost reports for fiscal year ended June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1994. </p>
<p>However, the improper billings and cost classifications did not have a material 
  financial effect for our 2-year review period because the SNF had an exemption 
  from the Medicare limit on its routine costs during this time period. </p>
<p>We recommended that Blue Cross ensure that Saint Louise Hospital and Health 
  Center's SNF identifies and adjusts its claims to reverse all routine items 
  billed as ancillary medical supplies, identifies and reclassifies any routine 
  costs previously claimed as ancillary on its costs reports, and does not bill 
  or claim future routine medical supplies as ancillary. </p>
