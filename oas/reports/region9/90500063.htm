<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">iCare Medical Supply, Inc. (iCare), did not claim 
reimbursement for test strips and lancets in accordance with Medicare 
requirements.&nbsp; Medical reviewers found that none of iCare’s claims for the 100 
sampled beneficiaries met Medicare requirements and that each service line item 
on each claim had one or more errors. </a>&nbsp;These errors 
occurred because iCare did not have adequate controls to ensure that test strips 
and lancets billed to Medicare were medically necessary and documented in 
accordance with Medicare requirements. &nbsp;</a>As a result, 
iCare received $73,040 in unallowable Medicare payments for the 100 sampled 
beneficiaries. &nbsp;</a>Projecting these results to the 
population, we estimated that at least $8,233,476 of the $8,664,874 paid to iCare 
for test strips and lancets provided in calendar years 2002 and 2003 was 
unallowable for Medicare reimbursement.<br>
<br>
We recommended that iCare refund $8,233,476 to the Medicare program and work 
with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to determine the allowability 
of test strips and lancets billed after calendar year 2003.
</a>&nbsp;In its comments on our draft report, iCare did not address our 
recommendations.&nbsp; </p>
