<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report
    points out that the California Department of Health Services (state) made
    disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to four Los Angeles County
    hospitals that exceeded the hospitals’ uncompensated care costs (UCC) limits
    for state fiscal year 1998.&nbsp; The UCC limits as determined by the state
    did not comply with the purpose of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
    of 1993 and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements
    and implementing guidance.&nbsp; The excess DSH payments to the hospitals
    totaled over $195 million ($98 million federal share).&nbsp; The UCC limits
    were overstated because the state; (1) used projected amounts instead of
    actual incurred costs and payments for the year in which hospital services
    were rendered, (2) did not limit total operating expenses to amounts that
    would be allowable under Medicare cost principles, and (3) inappropriately
    included bad debts as an additional operating expense.&nbsp; We recommended
    that the state work with CMS to address and resolve the $98 million federal
share of the overpayment.&nbsp; The state generally disagreed with our findings.</p>
