<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report summarizes our audit of the use of Child Support Enforcement
  (CSE) incentives and inequities in the incentive formula. We concluded that
  incentive payments were used primarily to fund the State or local jurisdictions'
  share of CSE costs. Some States realized significant savings from the State
  share of collections for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, while their
  counties incurred the costs of operating the CSE program. We also found that
  the method used for calculating incentives was often inconsistent with the
  Federal CSE performance objectives. We are recommending that incentives be
  based on the States' demonstrated capability to meet Federal CSE requirements
  and performance objectives. </p>
