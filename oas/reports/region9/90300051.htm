<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Under Part C (Medicare+Choice) of the Medicare program, Medicare+Choice organizations (MCOs) are responsible for providing
  all Medicare-covered services, except hospice care, in return for a predetermined capitated payment.&nbsp; The Benefits
  Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 provided an estimated $11 billion in increased capitation payments to MCOs
  effective March 1, 2001.&nbsp; BIPA required MCOs with plans for which payment rates increased to submit a revised proposal
  to show how they would use the increase during 2001.&nbsp; According to section 604(c) of BIPA, MCOs were required to use
  the additional amounts to reduce beneficiary premiums or cost-sharing, enhance benefits, contribute to a stabilization
  fund for benefits in future years, or stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers.&nbsp; Blue Shield revised proposal
  reflected an increase in Medicare capitation payments of about $17 million for contract year 2001.</p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) (1) used the additional capitation payments
  in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements and (2) supported the modifications to the 2001 proposal.&nbsp; Of the $17
  million capitation payment increase in Blue Shield's revised proposal, $12.5 million was used in a manner consistent with
  BIPA requirements and was properly supported.&nbsp; However, Blue Shield could not document, nor could we determine, how
  much of the remaining $4.5 million for increased fee-for-service costs was used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; Also,
  Blue Shield could not support the estimated $4.5 million increase for fee-for-service costs in its revised proposal.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Blue Shield work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine how much of the
  $4.5 million increase for fee-for-service costs was used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements.&nbsp; Any funds
  not used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements should be refunded to CMS or, as an alternative, deposited in a
  benefit stabilization fund for use in future years.&nbsp; We also recommended that Blue Shield ensure that estimated costs
  in future proposals are properly supported.</p>
