<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Federal regulations
    require that states pursue Aid to Families with Dependent Children overpayments
    made prior to October 1, 1996, and make appropriate refunds to the Federal
    Government.&nbsp; This final report points out that California had not made
    such refunds for overpayments collected by Los Angeles County (estimated
    at approximately $24 million federal share).&nbsp; We recommended a financial
    adjustment for the $24 million and procedural corrections.&nbsp; The State
generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
