<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate whether the State of California (the State) had established
  adequate accountability and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We identified internal control
  and accountability weakness in the following areas:&nbsp; (1) Quarterly Reporting, (2) Accounts Receivable System, and
  (3) Dispute Resolution.&nbsp; Federal regulations require effective control and accountability for all funds, property,
  and other assets.&nbsp; We found that the State:&nbsp; (1) was not able to provide support for the uncollected rebate balance
  reported to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services as of June 30, 2002 and was not reconciling the ending balance
  of uncollected rebates to the receivable account, (2) did not maintain a general ledger accounts receivable control account,
  and (3) did not actively work to resolve disputes nor make use of the state hearing mechanism.&nbsp; The State partially
  agreed with the findings and recommendations regarding quarterly reporting and dispute resolution.&nbsp; The State disagreed
  with our recommendation regarding the accounts receivable system.</p>
