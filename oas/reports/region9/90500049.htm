<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (Arizona) properly
  claimed Federal Medicaid funding at the enhanced rate for skilled professional medical personnel for
  the period October 1, 2002, through September 30, 2003.&nbsp; Arizona generally complied with Federal
  regulations when claiming Federal Medicaid funding at the enhanced rate for skilled professional medical
  personnel.&nbsp; We noted that Arizona claimed a small amount of overhead costs that was not eligible
  for reimbursement at the enhanced rate.&nbsp; Arizona’s controls did not prevent overhead costs from
  being claimed for reimbursement at the enhanced rate.&nbsp; We recommended that Arizona strengthen
  controls to ensure that overhead costs are not claimed for Federal reimbursement at the enhanced rate.&nbsp; Arizona
  officials agreed with our finding and recommendation. </p>
