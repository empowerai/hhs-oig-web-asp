<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of a 3-year (April 1994
  through March 1997) demonstration project in Los Angeles County named the Automated
  Fingerprint Image Reporting and Match System (AFIRM). The primary purpose of
  the project is to detect and deter multiple case fraud in the Aid to Families
  with Dependent Children (AFDC) program in a cost-effective manner. Our review
  showed that, to date, the AFIRM project is inconclusive as to how well fingerprinting
  works in combating multiple case fraud. However, the project has had a significant
  impact in removing cases from the AFDC roles, with savings estimated to be
  in excess of the $20.6 million approved for operating the project. However,
  most of these savings were not attributable to the detection and deterrence
  of multiple case fraud, but to other types of fraud and to the termination
  of cases due to the failure of recipients to keep interview appointments. We
  make no recommendations in our report, but are providing the report to ACF
  for their use in making future decisions involving the use of automated fingerprinting
  technology in the AFDC program. </p>
