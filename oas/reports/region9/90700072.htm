<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the administrative 
costs that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona (Arizona) claimed in its Final 
Administrative Cost Proposals were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in 
accordance with part&nbsp;31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Medicare 
contract.&nbsp; <span class="address">
<span style="font-weight:normal">Of the $13,944,069 claimed by 
Arizona, $13,234,541 was allowable, allocable, and reasonable.&nbsp; The remaining 
$709,528 represents pension costs that we did not audit; we plan to review these 
costs in a separate audit.&nbsp; Consequently, this report contains no 
recommendations.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
