<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Internal service funds are operated to provide goods and services on a cost 
  reimbursable basis to agencies within a State. Such funds are required to operate 
  on a break-even basis by charging users for allowable costs as established under 
  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87. A prior audit resulted in the 
  State returning $10.3 million to the Federal Government for a surplus accumulated 
  in an internal service fund. Our current audit, covering the period July 1984 
  through June 1991, showed the State owed the Federal Government an estimated 
  $12.2 million for accumulated surpluses in internal service funds. We recommended 
  that the State refund this amount and adjust billing rates to eliminate surpluses 
  or deficits. Regional officials of the Division of Cost Allocation generally 
  agreed with our findings and recommendations. </p>
