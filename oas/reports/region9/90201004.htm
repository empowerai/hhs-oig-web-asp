<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
The objectives of this audit were to evaluate the effectiveness of the project management and the allowability of the costs.
Our review disclosed that the University of Southern California (USC) did not meet the project objectives, conducted research
on human subjects without proper authorization, did not adequately resolve a conflict of interest, and claimed costs that
were not allowable for Federal
reimbursement.&nbsp; This occurred because:&nbsp; (i) inexperienced personnel were assigned to implement critical aspects
of the program, (ii) the co-principal investigator did not agree with the Institutional
Review Board’s conclusion that the program was conducting research involving human subjects, (iii) USC had not followed through
to rectify the conflict of interest situation, and (iv) oversight of the award expenditures was not adequate. We made recommendations
to improve USC’s grant administration and oversight, and to refund over $1.0 million in unallowable
costs.</span><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/bottom.lbi" -->
