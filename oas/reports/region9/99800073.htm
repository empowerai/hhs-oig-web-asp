<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>We determined that Sutter misclassified costs on its Medicare cost reports 
  and incorrectly billed for ancillary medical supplies. We found that about 39&nbsp;percent 
  of costs for ancillary medical supplies were misclassified and about 7&nbsp;percent 
  of items billed as ancillary medical supplies were actually routine supplies. 
  We also noted that Sutter incorrectly classified $282,018 of supply accounts 
  resulting in excessive ancillary costs. Due to Sutter's election to change fiscal 
  intermediaries (FI) effective January 1, 1998, we issued a report to each FI. 
  This report was directed to Sutter's new FI. In it, we recommended that Sutter 
  review its procedures for classifying ancillary medical supplies and provide 
  training to its staff to ensure that accounts are properly classified. </p>
