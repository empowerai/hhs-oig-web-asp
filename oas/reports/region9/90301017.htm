<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the AIDS Office,
    a Ryan White Title I grantee, ensured that Baker Places, one of its housing contractors (1) provided the expected program
    services to clients eligible for CARE Act Title I and (2) followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under
    CARE Act Title I.&nbsp; The AIDS Office ensured that Baker Places provided expected program services.&nbsp; However,
    it did not monitor Baker Places to ensure that the time limit for housing services met the intent of CARE Act Title I
    and that Baker Places followed Federal requirements for claiming costs.&nbsp; In addition to five procedural recommendations,
    we recommended that the AIDS Office (1) refund $216,461 to the Federal Government, the total amount overpaid to Baker
    Places for unallowable costs, and (2) work with HRSA to evaluate the allowability of $80,776 claimed for housing services
    that may not have met the intent of CARE Act Title I, and make a refund as appropriate.</p>
