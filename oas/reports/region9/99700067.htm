<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report points out a need for improvement in the California Department 
  of Social Services (DSS) procedures for reporting on and measuring the effectiveness 
  of its license suspension program for collecting delinquent child support payments. 
  Although the DSS had a management information system for its Child Support Enforcement 
  program, the system did not identify and provide information on the amount of 
  collections of delinquent payments that were generated as a result of the license 
  suspension program. The DSS agreed with our recommendation for establishing 
  such procedures, and stated that it would pursue this as part of a statewide 
  automation effort for the program. </p>
