<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of a $500,000 
  discretionary grant awarded to the Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation 
  (the Corporation) by the Office of Community Services.&nbsp; The audit was to 
  determine whether the Corporation (i) achieved the project goals and complied 
  with the terms and conditions of the grant, and (ii) properly recorded, accounted 
  for, and reported on Federal funds.&nbsp; The Corporation did not accomplish 
  the goals of the grant, which were to develop a commercial building and create 
  112 permanent jobs.&nbsp; We also found that the Corporation did not adequately 
  manage the grant funds in accordance with Federal regulations and the terms 
  and conditions of the grant.&nbsp; All of the costs claimed under the grant 
  were not supported by adequate documentation.&nbsp; In addition, interest earned 
  on Federal advances of funds was not returned to the Federal Government.&nbsp; 
  We recommended that the Corporation refund $95,560 to the Federal Government 
  and take steps to improve its management and internal controls.</p>
