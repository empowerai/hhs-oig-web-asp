<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Conrad &amp; Associates, L.L.P., Certified Public Accountants, under contract
  with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), performed a financial
  and compliance audit of expenditures claimed by Blue Cross of California (BCC)
  related to administration of the Medicare Part A program. The audit covered
  Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP's) for the Medicare program submitted
  by BCC for the period of October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1994. Also audited
  were additional costs amounting to $675,787 for fiscal year (FY) 1991 (October
  1, 1990 through September 30, 1991), $1,465,060 for FY 1992 (October 1, 1991
  through September 30, 1992), $866,087 for FY 1993 (October 1, 1992 through
  September 30, 1993) and $136,509 for FY 1994 (October 1, 1993 through September
  30, 1994) that were allocated to the Medicare program but not claimed on the
  FACP's because inclusion of those costs would cause the BCC approved administrative
  budget to have been exceeded. </p>
<p>The audit included such tests necessary to assure that costs charged to Medicare
  were allowable and allocable and were provided in an economic and efficient
  manner. The audit efforts tested the allowability of those administrative costs
  as well as their allocability to the Medicare program using the Medicare agreements,
  the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and appropriate cost accounting standards
  and generally accepted accounting standards as guiding criteria. </p>
<p>For the period, BCC reported Medicare Part A program administrative costs
  of $122,275,135. Of these costs, we have questioned $1,653,079 as follows:
  $244,617 for FY 1991; $111,106 for FY 1992; $1,210,837 for FY 1993; and $86,519
  for FY 1994. The recommended settlement amounts presented in Schedule C do
  not include as an offset the amounts allocated to the Program but not claimed
  on the FACP's for FYs 1991 through 1994. HCFA would be responsible for approving
  any offsets. The following is a summarization of our findings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Return on Investment:</u> Costs of $1,261 for FY 1994 are questioned
    because BCC overclaimed return on investment (ROI) reimbursements. The overclaim
    resulted from an error made by BCC in the calculation of building depreciation
    and the inclusion of certain non-Medicare assets in the base used in the
    ROI calculation.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>FACP Preparation Errors:</u> Costs of $32,513 and $4,918 for FYs 1993
    and 1994, respectively, are questioned because certain cost centers were
    overstated due to errors made by BCC while preparing spreadsheets used in
    the preparation of the FACP's.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Intercompany Cost Allocation Error:</u> Costs of $857,201 for FY 1993
    are questioned because an Intercompany Cost Allocation cost center was erroneously
    excluded from the spreadsheet used in the preparation of the FACP.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Duplicated FACP Adjustment:</u> Costs of $236,262 for FY 1993 are questioned
    because an adjustment to include costs related to a productivity investment
    project were erroneously added twice during the preparation of the FACP.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Cost Centers Not Benefitting the Medicare Program:</u> Costs of $48,356
    and $3,822 for FYs 1992 and 1993, respectively, are questioned because the
    nature and activities of certain cost centers allocating costs to Medicare
    did not provide a benefit to the Medicare program.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Reported Costs Not Supported by Underlying Accounting Records:</u> Costs
    of $127,996 for FY 1991 are questioned because the FACP reported costs in
    excess of those reflected in the underlying Medicare accounting cost records.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Unsupported Costs:</u> Costs of $28,282 for FY 1991 are questioned because
    supporting documentation was not provided.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Adjustment to Limit Building Lease Costs to That of the Cost of Ownership
      Excluded from FACP:</u> Costs of $79,229 for FY 1991 are questioned because
      a building lease cost adjustment used to limit administrative costs claimed
      to that of the costs of ownership was understated.<br />
    <br wp="br1" />
  </li>
  <li><u>Excess of Executive Compensation Increases Over the ECI Allocated to
      Medicare:</u> Compensation increases given to nine BCC executives during
      our review period were determined not to be reasonable when compared to
      the Employment Cost Index (ECI) developed by the United States Department
      of Labor for the same period. Of the excess compensation costs identified,
      $233,239 were allocated to Medicare and are questioned as follows: $9,110
      for FY year 1991; $62,750 for FY 1992; $81,039 for FY 1993; and $80,340
      for FY 1994.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete discussion of these findings, refer to the Findings and Recommendations
  section of this report. </p>
<p>A draft copy of the report was provided to BCC requesting their response to
  the various findings noted in the report. The responses where appropriate,
  have been included in the body of the report, and included in their entirety
  as Appendix A of the final report. BCC in their response accepted the audit
  results with the exception of the questioned amount of $233,239 for &quot;Excess
  of Executive Compensation Increases Over The ECI Allocated to Medicare&quot; both
  from the standpoint of the actual calculation and the concept of applying the
  ECI developed by the United States Department of Labor. Because the total amount
  questioned in the report ($1,653,079) was substantially less than the amount
  BCC did not charge to Medicare due to budget limitations ($3,143,443), BCC
  elected not to pursue any further effort to locate documentation that may have
  supported some of the questioned items.</p>
