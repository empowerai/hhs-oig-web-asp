<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Health Net’s use of its Medicare Prescription Drug,
  Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increase was allowable and adequately supported
  under the MMA. Health Net’s use of its MMA payment increase of $5.6 million (or $42.88 per-member
  per-month) was allowable and adequately supported under the MMA.&nbsp; Specifically, Health
  Net used the increased MMA payments to reduce beneficiary cost sharing, enhance benefits,
  and stabilize beneficiary access to providers.&nbsp; Therefore, we are not making any recommendations
  to Health Net.</p>
