<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether 
Medicare payments of $50,000 or more (high-dollar payments) that National 
Government Services made to hospitals for outpatient services were appropriate.&nbsp; Of the 59 high-dollar payments that National Government Services made for 
outpatient services for calendar years 2003 through 2005, 18 were appropriate.&nbsp; The remaining 41 payments included overpayments totaling $3,463,740.&nbsp; For all 41 
claims, the hospitals inappropriately overstated the units of service, 
occasionally in combination with incorrect procedure codes.&nbsp; The hospitals have 
already refunded the overpayments; comments we received from some hospitals 
indicated that they were analyzing their billing systems and procedures and 
would provide training and make system enhancements as appropriate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because National Government Services 
has already recovered the overpayments from the hospitals and implemented a 
Fiscal Intermediary Standard System edit to suspend high-dollar outpatient 
claims for prepayment review, we have not included any recommendations in this 
report. &nbsp;National Government Services officials agreed with the results of 
our audit.</p>
