<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out significant problems in California's administration
  of federally mandated foster care protections provided foster care children
  in the State's juvenile justice system. State plan requirements for the case
  review system were, in large part, not met. Also, one or both of the required
  judicial determinations pertaining to the child's removal from the home were
  not always made for these children. These protections were not effective due
  to a lack of sufficient oversight by the California Department of Social Services
  (CDSS). We recommended that CDSS periodically review a sample of cases to ensure
  that the protections are being provided and furnish oversight and technical
  assistance to the county probation departments to ensure the proper administration
  of Federal foster care requirements. The CDSS concurred with our recommendations. </p>
