<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Native Air claimed air ambulance services for calendar year
  2002 pursuant to Medicare billing requirements.&nbsp; Of our random sample of 100 claims, 15 claims
  were improper.&nbsp; Of the 15 claims, 1 claim was for a medically inappropriate service, and 14 claims
  were for transporting patients beyond the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities. As a result,
  $10,589 of the $330,713 reviewed was unallowable.&nbsp; We estimated that at least $62,408 of the $3,968,759
  paid to Native Air for air ambulance claims was unallowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Native Air:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Medicare program $62,408 in overpayments, (2) strengthen policies
  and procedures to ensure that only medically appropriate air transport services are billed to Medicare,
  and (3) strengthen policies and procedures to ensure that air transport services are billed for the
  mileage to the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities and that documentation in the medical records
  supports the reason for transporting patients beyond the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities.&nbsp; In
  written comments, Native Air disagreed with our findings and procedural recommendations and did not
  comment on our recommendation for a refund.</p>
