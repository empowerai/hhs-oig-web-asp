<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report points out that the State agency did not give the
  Federal Government full financial credit for casualty third party liability
  (TPL) recoveries. State laws allowed recipients to keep, in part, settlement
  and award amounts that Federal laws require be used to reimburse Medicaid for
  medical expenses paid on behalf of the recipients. We recommended a financial
  adjustment for $7.6 million. We also recommended that the State agency establish
  procedures to ensure that the Federal Government is given full credit for TPL
  settlements and awards in accordance with Federal requirements. </p>
