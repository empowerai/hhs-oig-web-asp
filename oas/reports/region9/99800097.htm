<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report to Blue Cross of California, Horizon West Inc.'s (Horizon)
  current fiscal intermediary, points out that Horizon misclassified certain
  costs as ancillary medical supplies. The costs should have been classified
  and claimed as other types of costs, such as routine, dietary, and administrative
  and general costs. As a result of this misclassification, Horizon was overpaid
  Medicare funds totaling $1.1 million for Fiscal Year (FY) 1991. Horizon concurred
  with our findings and voluntarily repaid the Federal Government $1.7 million.
  This amount included the $1.1 million we identified as an overpayment plus
  an additional $0.7 million to cover our estimate of overpayments made for FYs
  1992 through 1995. On February 4, 1999, Horizon agreed to a settlement with
  the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG. As part of this agreement, Horizon
  entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG and paid an additional
  $2.3 million to settle claims with the Government relating to the audit findings. </p>
<p>We recommended that Blue Cross ensure that medical supplies are properly classified
  as ancillary or routine on all Horizon cost reports after the Fiscal Year Ended
  June 30, 1995. </p>
