<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Orthopaedic Hospital’s
  (the hospital’s) outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed to Medicare
  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; Based on our review
  of 35 judgmentally selected outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) claims,
  we found the hospital incorrectly billed Medicare on 7 claims.&nbsp; Due to
  the billing errors, the hospital was underpaid a net amount of $15,240.&nbsp; The
  billing errors occurred because the hospital did not correctly implement the
  OPPS requirement concerning the number of units to use when billing Medicare
  for drugs.&nbsp; We recommended that the hospital strengthen its billing procedures
  and resubmit the claims found to be in error to the fiscal intermediary for
  adjustments. The hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
