<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>We found that about 24 percent of the ancillary medical supply costs claimed 
  by Heartland were misclassified on its Medicare cost reports. In addition, about 
  13 percent of items billed to Medicare as ancillary pharmacy items were actually 
  routine supplies. Heartland is one of 127 nursing facilities owned by Health 
  Care Retirement Corporation (HCRC). Since the errors we found may also have 
  occurred at the other HCRC facilities, we recommended that HCRC determine the 
  fiscal impact at all 127 facilities for incorrectly claimed costs and billing 
  errors and make an appropriate refund to Medicare. We also recommended that 
  HCRC review is master list to identify and correct its classifications of ancillary 
  medical and pharmacy supplies that should be treated as routine. </p>
