<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report discloses that Beverly Manor of Margate (Beverly Manor) generally 
  complied with Medicare's rules relating to the treatment of medical supplies 
  as ancillary or routine, both as Medicare billings and as costs claimed on its 
  Medicare cost reports for calendar years ended December 31, 1993 and December 
  31, 1994. Beverly Manor is one of over 600 skilled nursing facilities in a national 
  chain. </p>
<p>However, from a review of the current master list used to classify each medical 
  supply item as routine or ancillary, we noted 36 routine medical supply items 
  that were classified as ancillary. According to Beverly Manor's home office, 
  Beverly Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc. (BH&amp;RS), this master list 
  is used by all facilities in the chain. </p>
<p>We recommended that Blue Cross ensure that BH&amp;RS reviews its master list 
  to identify and correct all of its classifications of ancillary medical supplies 
  that should be treated as routine. </p>
