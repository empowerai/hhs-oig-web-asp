<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 






<p class="MsoNormal">The report summarizes the results of our reviews of 12 
selected physician practices in the specialties of hematology, 
hematology/oncology, and medical oncology.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eleven of the twelve practices reviewed did not have 
procedures to track, by procedure code, the costs associated with administering 
drugs to cancer patients.&nbsp; Without procedures for tracking these costs by 
procedure code, the 11 practices could not determine whether Medicare 
reimbursement for each code was sufficient to cover the costs of providing the 
services.&nbsp; Nine of the twelve practices could generally purchase drugs related 
to 15 selected payment codes for the treatment of cancer patients at or below 
the reimbursement rates established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act.&nbsp; The remaining three practices paid prices 
above the reimbursement rates for at least half of the payment codes related to 
the drugs purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that CMS consider the results of the review in any future evaluations of 
Medicare Part B reimbursement of costs associated with the administration and 
purchase of drugs for the treatment of cancer patients.&nbsp; CMS agreed with the 
recommendation.</span>
