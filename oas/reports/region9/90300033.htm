<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate whether the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing
  and Policy (the State agency) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate
  program.&nbsp; We found that the State agency had not established adequate policies, procedures, and internal controls
  over its drug rebate program.&nbsp; Specifically, we identified weaknesses in the following areas:&nbsp; (1) accounts receivable
  system, (2) rebate billings, (3) interest accrual and collection, and (4) dispute resolution.&nbsp; As a result, the State
  Agency did not properly report drug rebate information to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services nor adequately establish
  policies, procedures, and internal controls to account for drug rebate program transactions.&nbsp; In addition, the lack
  of adequate internal controls increased the risk for delayed collection of drug rebate funds and the potential loss of
  interest that could have been collected.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
