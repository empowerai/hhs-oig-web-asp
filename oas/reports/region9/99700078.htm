<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>In this final report, we found that the Medical provider was overpaid for services 
  included in 84 and underpaid for 15 of the 100 sample claims. The 100 claims 
  included payments for a total of 167 separate services. We determined that 151 
  services, or 90 percent of the 167 services were either completely unallowable 
  or partially unallowable for Medicare reimbursement. We estimate based on a 
  projection of our sample results that the Medical Provider received at least 
  $683,264 in overpayments for claims for services performed during the period 
  June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1997. </p>
