<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>During the period October 1, 1995 through November 30, 1996, California Physicians' 
  Service, dba Blue Shield of California, claimed administrative costs totaling 
  $33,951,916. The administrative costs charged to Medicare were overstated by 
  $234,378. The $234,378 consisted of unreasonable increases in executive compensation 
  costs ($60,230), salaries over the Federal limit ($20,122), unallowable consulting 
  fees ($111,679), legal fees ($29,418), executive search fees ($4,829) and understated 
  complementary credits ($8,100). We recommended that Blue Shield reduce its Medicare 
  claims for the $234,378 in overstated costs. With the exception of our recommended 
  adjustment of $8,100 for the complementary insurance credit, Blue Shield concurred 
  with our audit findings. </p>
