<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that the California Department of Health Services
  (DHS) understated its third party liability (TPL) recoveries by $2,255,239
  (Federal share of $1,127,620) for the period July 1, 1988 through March 31,
  1991. Also, DHS did not maintain complete records which reconciled reported
  amounts to the subsidiary records. Since recoveries serve as credits which
  reduce net expenditures, DHS effectively overclaimed Federal funds for the
  Medicaid program by not reporting the $2,255,239 of recoveries. We recommended
  that DHS refund $1,127,620 to the Federal Government. We also recommended that
  DHS establish internal controls to ensure that: (1) documentation is retained
  to support reported TPL recoveries and (2) recoveries are accurately accounted
  for on Federal reports. The DHS concurred with our findings and recommendations. </p>
