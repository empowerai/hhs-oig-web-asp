<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report summarizes the results of 17 audits of indirect cost rate 
  proposals completed in Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993. The Office of Inspector General 
  (OIG) identified 180 findings with adjustments totaling $507 million. Using 
  the OIG findings, the Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) negotiated indirect 
  cost rates which were as much as 34 percentage points lower than the rates initially 
  proposed. Based on the results of completed negotiations at all 17 institutions, 
  DCA credited the OIG with the Federal share of actual savings (funds put to 
  better use) of $179 million. Because of continuing interest in and concern with 
  indirect costs and the continued specter of staff shortages in both DCA and 
  OIG, future plans are to; (1) identify high risk areas and concentrate efforts 
  in those areas, (2) encourage universities to improve the systems they use to 
  prepare indirect cost proposals, and (3) identify improvements that will strengthen 
  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21. </p>
