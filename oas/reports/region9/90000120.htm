<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Unlike other areas of the Medicare program, there is no statutory or regulatory
  authority governing the allowability of costs in determining adjusted community
  rates (ACRs) for Medicare+Choice organizations (M+CO). This review of six ACR
  proposals for 2000 submitted by a Southwest M+CO was made to determine if the
  administrative costs were reasonable, necessary, and allocable when compared
  to Medicare&#146;s general principle of paying only reasonable costs. We found,
  however, that the ACRs included $35.4 million in costs that; (1) were in excess
  of the amount that would have been allocated on the basis of enrollment, (2)
  were not allocable to Medicare, (3) would not be allowable if existing Medicare
  regulations (either for cost HMOs or in the fee-for-service arena) were applied
  to M+COs, and (4) pertained to unsupported related-party transactions and other
  unsupported costs. The results of this review, along with the results of similar
  reviews of other M+CO organizations are being shared with the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services so that appropriate legislative changes can be considered.</p>
