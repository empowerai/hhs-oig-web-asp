<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report discloses that Little Company of Mary Health Services billed Medicare 
  for medical supplies and pharmacy supplies that were not in compliance with 
  Medicare's rules and misclassified significant costs on the Medicare cost reports 
  of its two hospital-based skilled nursing facilities for fiscal years ended 
  June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1994. </p>
<p>We did not quantify the financial impact of the unallowable billings or misclassified 
  costs as our review was limited to determining what types of supplies and services 
  were billed as ancillary or claimed as ancillary cots and were unallowable as 
  such. </p>
<p>We recommended that Blue Cross ensure that Little Company of Mary Health Services 
  makes certain procedural changes and refiles appropriate cost reports, if necessary.
