<hr noshade><strong><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Federal regulations require that states pursue Aid to Families with Dependent 
  Children overpayments made prior to October 1, 1996, and make appropriate refunds 
  to the Federal Government.&nbsp; This final report points out that the State 
  of California had not done so for such overpayments totaling $5.2 million (Federal 
  share) collected during the period November 22, 1996 through July 31, 2001.&nbsp; 
  We recommended a financial adjustment for the $5.2 million, and that the State 
  also refund the Federal share of overpayments collected subsequent to July 31, 
  2001.</p>
