<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that Horizon West, Inc. misclassified certain 
  costs as ancillary medical supplies. The costs should have been classified and 
  claimed as other types of costs, such as routine, dietary, and administrative 
  and general costs. As a result of this misclassification, Horizon was overpaid 
  Medicare funds totating $1.1 million for Fiscal Year (FY) 1991. Horizon concurred 
  with out finding and has voluntarily repaid the Federal Government $1.7 million. 
  This amount includes the $1.1 million we identified as an overpayment plus an 
  additional $0.7 million to cover our estimate of overpayments made for FYs 1992 
  through 1995. </p>
