<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Short/Doyle is one component of the California Medicaid program. It is a special
  program serving the mentally ill, and is operated by the various counties in
  California which arrange for hospital and clinic services. In Fiscal Year (FY)
  1985, the State began negotiating Short/Doyle contracts with selected counties.
  Initially, three counties received contracts. By FY 1988, 14 counties operated
  under this arrangement. Our audit disclosed that excessive Medicaid payments
  were made to these counties. The payments exceeded Medicaid limits by about
  $15 million ($7.5 million Federal share) over 5 years. We recommended that
  the State refund the $7.5 million and establish procedures to ensure that payments
  are properly limited in the future. State officials did not agree with our
  finding and recommendations. However, regional Health Care Financing Administration
  officials concurred. </p>
