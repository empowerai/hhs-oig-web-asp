<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of our audit was to 
determine whether the University of California, San Francisco (the 
University) claimed reimbursement for administrative and clerical expenses as 
direct costs to National Institutes of Health grants, contracts, and other 
agreements in accordance with applicable Federal regulations.&nbsp; We found that the 
University substantially complied with Federal regulations for claiming 
reimbursement for administrative and clerical expenses.&nbsp; The University made 
minor clerical errors in charging costs.&nbsp; However, University officials stated 
that the errors have been corrected.&nbsp; Consequently, our report contains no 
recommendations.</p>
