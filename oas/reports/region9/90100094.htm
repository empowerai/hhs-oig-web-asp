<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Medicare pays a higher capitation rate for Medicare beneficiaries who are
  institutionalized.&nbsp; This final report shows that PacifiCare plans outside
  California did not implement a policy letter issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
  Services in a timely manner.&nbsp; PacifiCare claimed the higher rate for some
  beneficiaries who were not institutionalized in December 1997, resulting in
  overpayments for January 1998. We estimated these overpayments to be in excess
  of $700,000.</p>
