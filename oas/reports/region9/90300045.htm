<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed MountainView Hospital (the Hospital)
  for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Our review found that even though physician supervision is generally
  assumed to be met in an outpatient hospital department, the Hospital did not designate a physician to directly supervise
  the services provided by its cardiac rehabilitation program staff.&nbsp; Further, the Hospital did not provide the services “incident
  to” a physician’s professional services.&nbsp; In addition, from our specific claims review for a non-statistical sample
  of 10 beneficiaries who received 129 outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services during Calendar Year 2001, we determined
  that the Hospital received Medicare reimbursement for the services, amounting to approximately $350, for which the diagnoses
  used to establish the patient’s eligibility for the services may not have been supported by medical record documentation,
  or which were otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; We attributed these questionable services to weaknesses in the Hospital’s internal
  controls and oversight procedures.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital (1) work with its fiscal intermediary regarding
  the direct physician supervision and “incident to” requirements; (2) work with its fiscal intermediary to establish the
  amount of repayment liability, estimated to be as much as $350; (3) bill for evaluation and orientation services only when
  performed by a physician; and (4) implement controls to ensure that documentation is maintained in the medical records
  to support outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services that are provided.&nbsp; The Hospital agreed to take actions based
  on our recommendations, although it did not concur with our findings regarding direct physician supervision and “incident
  to” physician services.</p>
