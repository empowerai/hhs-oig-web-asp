<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Medicare payments to PCH Health Systems, Inc. (PCH)
  for outpatient physical and occupational therapy services met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; None
  of PCH’s 114 sampled claims for outpatient physical and occupational therapy services provided
  from 2000 through 2003 met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; One hundred and three
  claims were for medically unnecessary services and eleven claims were not supported.&nbsp; Most
  of the 114 claims also had other types of errors.</p>
<p>We recommended that PCH refund $9,984,065 to the Medicare program and work with the Centers
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to determine the allowability of services billed after
  2003.&nbsp; Because PCH no longer treats Medicare patients or bills the Medicare program,
  we also recommended that it request its carrier to deactivate PCH’s Medicare provider number.&nbsp; PCH
  did not provide comments to our draft report, issued March 13, 2006.&nbsp; We received comments
  from National Heritage Insurance Company, the Medicare carrier for beneficiaries in California.</p>
