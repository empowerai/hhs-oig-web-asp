<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Senate Finance Committee requested that we assess the 
fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations with respect 
to six specified fiscal integrity areas.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of the $12.2 million of costs reviewed, $12.1 million appeared reasonable for 
Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; The remaining $73,636 represented unallowable indirect 
costs, which Qualis Health allocated to subcontracts in excess of the allowable 
limit.&nbsp; In addition, Qualis Health overstated its (1) modified total direct 
costs (MTDC) bases by $404,302 in total for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 by 
including subcontract costs in excess of the allowable $25,000 per subcontract 
and (2) indirect cost pool by $71,741 for fiscal year 2005 by including 
unallowable organization costs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that Qualis Health (1) refund the $73,636 of unallowable indirect 
costs claimed on subcontracts and (2) reduce the MTDC allocation bases by 
$404,302 in total for unallowable subcontract costs and the indirect cost pool 
by $71,741 for unallowable organization costs when finalizing the indirect cost 
rates with CMS.&nbsp; Qualis Health agreed with the finding related to unallowable 
indirect costs but disagreed with the amount of the recommended refund. &nbsp;Based 
on our evaluation of additional information concerning the finalization of 
indirect cost rates, we revised our report to reflect a refund amount of 
$73,636.</p>
