<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report discloses that California's Department of Developmental
  Services (DDS) was overpaid for 73 of 100 statistically sampled services. The
  point estimate of the overpayments was $13,046,880 for the 4 ½ year period
  ended June 30, 1997. Fifty-nine of the sampled services were denied, and 14
  were allowed but at lesser amounts. We recommend that the carrier develop with
  the Health Care Financing Administration's guidance a monitoring plan to ensure
  that DDS' future claims are brought into compliance with Medicare's rules.
  We also recommended that the identified overpayment not be recovered at this
  time pending further review by the OIG. </p>
