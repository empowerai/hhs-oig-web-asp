<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of medical and ancillary Medicaid 
  claims for 21 to 64 year old residents of state-operated psychiatric hospitals 
  that are institutions for mental diseases in California during the period of 
  July 1, 1997 through&nbsp;February 28, 2001.&nbsp; This audit is part of our 
  ongoing review of Medicaid billings for patients in institutions for mental 
  diseases (IMD).&nbsp; The objective of this audit was to determine if the state 
  of California had adequate controls to preclude claiming federal financial participation 
  (FFP) under the Medicaid program when 21 to 64 year old residents of state-operated 
  IMDs received physician services, laboratory and clinic services, and hospital 
  outpatient treatment.&nbsp; Federal Medicaid law and regulations prohibit FFP 
  for this care.&nbsp; Our review disclosed that although the state did not have 
  specific edits to prevent it from claiming FFP, only a minor amount of unallowable 
  FFP was claimed for medical and ancillary services.&nbsp; We concluded that 
  the state was in substantial compliance with federal rules prohibiting claims 
  for FFP under the Medicaid program for medical and ancillary services provided 
  to residents 21 to 64 years old in its two state-operated psychiatric hospitals.</p>
