<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report summarizes the results of our reviews, made at the request 
  of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), of 186 adjusted community 
  rate proposals (ACRPs) submitted by 55 Medicare+Choice (M+C) organizations for 
  Contract Year 2000. In general, we found that: 49 percent of the ACRPs were 
  not prepared in accordance with CMS’ instructions; 66 percent contained errors 
  that affected at least one of the three components of the adjusted community 
  rate (direct medical care, administration, or additional revenues); and 36 percent 
  overstated the beneficiary premium/cost sharing amounts and/or did not provide 
  additional benefits. We were unable to determine an overall dollar effect of 
  the miscalculated ACRPs, however, there could have been a significant impact 
  on (1) payments made by the M+C organizations to their providers, (2) out-of-pocket 
  expenses of the beneficiaries, and (3) amount of profit earned by the M+C organizations. 
  Among other things, we recommended that CMS (1) reiterate to M+C organizations 
  the importance of following CMS’ instructions in preparing the ACRPs, (2) work 
  with the M+C organizations to have them develop corrective actions to address 
  the deficiencies noted in our audits to ensure that future ACRP submissions 
  are correct, and (3) perform follow-up evaluations of such actions. The CMS 
  generally concurred with our recommendations.</p>
