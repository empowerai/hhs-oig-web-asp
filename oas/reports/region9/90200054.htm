<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that the California Department of Health Services
  (state) made disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to 21 hospitals
  that exceeded the hospitals’ uncompensated care costs (UCC) limits for state
  fiscal year 1998.&nbsp; The UCC limits as determined by the state did not comply
  with the purpose of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Centers
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requirements and implementing guidance.&nbsp; The
  excess DSH payments for the 21 hospitals totaled over $252 million ($126.5
  million federal share).&nbsp; The UCC limits were overstated because the state;
  (1) used projected amounts instead of actual incurred costs and payments for
  the year in which hospital services were rendered, (2) did not limit total
  operating expenses to amounts that would be allowable under Medicare cost principles,
  and (3) inappropriately included bad debts as an additional operating expense.&nbsp; Among
  other things, and in addition to financial adjustments, we recommended that
  the state establish an adequate system of internal controls for DSH operations
  that meet federal and state requirements.</p>
