<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our audit of claims by optometrists 
  for comprehensive nursing facility (CNF) assessments during Calendar Years 1995 
  through 1998. We found that optometrists were not licensed to perform CNF assessments. 
  Nonetheless, optometrists submitted claims totaling $1,759,492 for these services, 
  and Transamerica paid them $957,366 for their claims. We recommended that Transamerica: 
  (1) issue a reminder to optometrists to bill Medicare only for services performed 
  within the scope of their licenses; and (2) implement computer payment edits 
  to prevent payment to optometrists for CNF assessments. Transamerica representatives 
  agreed with our audit findings and recommendations, and have implemented the 
  recommended corrective actions. We have requested that Transamerica not seek 
  recovery of the overpayments at this time as we are still evaluating the issue.
