<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This final report points out that the California Department of Health Services 
  made Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to the University 
  of California, San Diego Medical Center (UCSDMC) that exceeded by $8.0 million 
  (federal share) the hospital specific limit for DSH payments as mandated by 
  the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This problem occurred primarily 
  because the state:&nbsp; (1) used projected amounts instead of actual expenses 
  and payments, (2) did not limit total operating expenses to amounts that would 
  be allowable under Medicare cost principles, (3) included bad debts as additional 
  operating expenses, and (4) double counted some charges and included charges 
  for services provided to inmates. We recommended financial adjustments and procedural 
  corrections. The state generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
