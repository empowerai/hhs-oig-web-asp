<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This report consolidates the results of our audits of 11 centers.&nbsp;The objective of our audits was to determine whether the 11 centers claimed allowable organ acquisition costs on their Medicare cost reports.&nbsp;The 11 centers did not always comply with Medicare regulations and guidelines for claiming organ acquisition costs.&nbsp;Of the almost $80 million&nbsp;of costs audited, approximately $33 million complied with Medicare requirements for claiming, allocating, and documenting organ acquisition costs.&nbsp;However, almost $47&nbsp;million did not comply with Medicare&rsquo;s definition of organ acquisition costs, exceeded Medicare&rsquo;s limits on physician salaries, or was not allocated or documented properly.&nbsp;Based on the fiscal intermediaries&rsquo; revisions to the 11 centers&rsquo; cost reports for unallowable and unsupported costs, we estimate that Medicare&rsquo;s share of the $47 million is approximately $28 million.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS consider the results of our 11 audits in prioritizing areas to be evaluated in annual audits by the fiscal intermediaries.&nbsp;CMS agreed with our recommendation.</p>
