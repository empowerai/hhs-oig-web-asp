<p align="left"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report discusses ways to clarify guidance provided in the Office of Management
  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 regarding the financial management of recharge
  centers at universities. A recharge center operates as an in-house enterprise
  that provides goods and services to individual users and other operating units
  on a cost reimbursement basis. The objective of this report is to recommend
  changes to Circular A-21 based on an evaluation of the Office of Inspector
  General (OIG) reviews of recharge centers. </p>
<p>Generally, Circular A-21 requires each center to operate as a closed, self-adjusting
  system. By closed, we mean that all allowable expenses and revenues related
  to operating a center should be recorded in the center's accounts. By self-adjusting,
  we mean that the fund balance should accumulate the surplus or deficit of the
  operation of a center such that the billing rate can be adjusted to keep the
  fund balance within a reasonable range. However, we found that inadequate policies
  and controls over recharge centers at the 15 universities we visited resulted
  in $1.9 million in overcharges to the Federal Government. The $1.9 million
  related to 21 of the 87 recharge centers reviewed. Specifically, recharge centers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>accumulated surplus fund balances and deficits which were not used in the
    computation of subsequent billing rates;<br wp="br1" />
    <br wp="br2" />
  </li>
  <li>overstated billing rates by transferring funds from center accounts or
    including unallowable costs in rate calculations;<br wp="br1" />
    <br wp="br2" />
  </li>
  <li>billed users inequitably; and<br wp="br1" />
    <br wp="br2" />
  </li>
  <li>used recharge center fund balances (surpluses or deficits) inappropriately
    to calculate facilities and administrative (F&amp;A) cost rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ambiguity and lack of specific instructions in Circular A-21 may have
  contributed to the significant diversity in practice at universities. As such,
  we believe that the starting point for improving university oversight of recharge
  centers is to revise Section J.44 of Circular A-21 in a manner similar to the
  recently revised OMB Circular A-87, &quot; Cost Principles for State, Local
  and Indian Tribal Governments.&quot; Thus, we identify ways to clarify the
  criteria in Circular A-2 1 regarding the financial management of recharge centers.
  This would include the creation of criteria for developing and reviewing billing
  rates, and accounting for and applying surplus and deficit balances. </p>
<p>The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grants and Acquisition Management (DASGAM)
  concurred with our recommendation to have the Assistant Secretary for Management
  and Budget (ASMB) request that OMB incorporate our proposed criteria into Circular
  A-21. We also received comments from the Council on Governmental Relations
  (COGR) which comprises 140 research-intensive universities in the United States
  and helps develop policies and practices related to the administration and
  conduct of Federal research and training. COGR generally agreed with our findings
  and recommendations and offered to assist in publicizing the report's recommendations. </p>
