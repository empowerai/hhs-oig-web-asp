<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out a number of issues the Administration for Children
  and Families (ACF) needs to address with regards to facility purchases by Head
  Start grantees. To help ACF address these issues we are recommending, among
  other things, that ACF; provide technical assistance to grantees acquiring
  or planning to acquire facilities, require that property inspection reports
  submitted by grantees include the results for environmental hazards, require
  grantees to disclose any restrictions on the use of the facilities imposed
  by organizations providing supplemental funding, ensure that all necessary
  documentation, such as property appraisals and inspection reports be submitted
  prior to making grant awards, ensure that purchase requests describe all renovations
  that need to be made to the property, require grantees considering loans with
  balloon payments to disclose these plans, and explain how the balloon payment
  obligation will be met, and develop and implement a system to account for Head
  Start funds utilized for each facility purchased. The ACF generally concurred
  with our recommendations. </p>
