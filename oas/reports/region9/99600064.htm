<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our audit of eligibility determinations 
  for Medicare hospice beneficiaries at the San Diego Hospice Corporation (SDH), 
  San Diego, California. This audit was part of a joint initiative among various 
  Department of Health and Human Services components called Operation Restore 
  Trust (ORT). The ORT seeks to identify specific vulnerabilities in the Medicare 
  program and pursue ways to reduce Medicare exposure to abusive practices. The 
  hospice audits focused on Medicare beneficiaries in hospice care for at least 
  210 days. </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to evaluate hospice eligibility determinations 
  by the San Diego Hospice Corporation (SDH) for beneficiaries that remained in 
  hospice care for more than 210 days. We also determined the amount of payments 
  made to the SDH for those Medicare beneficiaries that did not meet the Medicare 
  reimbursement requirements. </p>
<p>Our review included a medical evaluation of the SDH&#146;S eligibility determinations 
  for 78 beneficiaries who had been in hospice care for more than 210 days. The 
  review showed that: 37 of the beneficiaries were not eligible for hospice coverage; 
  and for 19 beneficiaries, we were unable to conclusively determine their eligibility 
  status. </p>
<p>Our medical determinations were made by physicians employed by or under contract 
  with the Medicare peer review organization for California. All of the 37 ineligible 
  determinations were confirmed by medical review staff of Blue Cross of California 
  fiscal intermediary for the SDH. </p>
<p>The incorrect eligibility determinations were due to inaccurate prognoses of 
  life expectancy by hospice physicians based on the medical evidence in the patients&#146; 
  files or because the physicians certified beneficiaries as terminally ill based 
  on insufficient clinical data. The SDH received improper Medicare payments totaling 
  $2.1 million for the 37 ineligible beneficiaries and $1.35 million relating 
  to 19 beneficiaries for whom we were unable to determine that a terminal illness 
  existed at the time of admission to the hospice. </p>
<p>We are recommending the intermediary: 
<dl> 
  <dd> 
    <dl> 
      <dt>-- Recover payments of $2.1 million made through May 15, 1996 for the 
        37 beneficiaries who were not eligible for Medicare hospice benefits; 
        Recover any improper payments made on behalf of those beneficiaries enrolled 
        in hospice care after May 15, 1996; </h5>
  </dd>
  <dd> 
    <dl> 
      <dt>-- Conduct medical reviews of the 19 cases, for which the hospice received 
        $1.35 million, that we were unable to conclusively determine that the 
        beneficiary was terminally ill. Based on the results of these reviews, 
        take appropriate action to recover amounts determined to be overpayments.</h5>
  </dd>
  <dd> 
    <dl> 
      <dt>-- Coordinate with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in 
        providing training to hospice providers and physicians on eligibility 
        requirements for hospice beneficiaries, particularly the requirement for 
        a 6-month prognosis.</h5>
  </dd>
  <dd> 
    <dl> 
      <dt>-- Analyze utilization trends to identify hospices with numerous claims 
        for beneficiaries with over 210 days of hospice coverage and conduct medical 
        reviews on a sample of their claims.</h5>
  </dd>
  <dd> 
    <dl> 
      <dt>-- Conduct periodic reviews of hospice claims to ensure the hospices 
        are obtaining sufficient medical information to make valid eligibility 
        determinations.</h5>
    <p>The intermediary did not provide any comments concerning its concurrence 
      or nonconcurrence to our recommendations. It plans to perform medical reviews 
      for the 19 beneficiaries whose medical records did not contain sufficient 
      information and consult with HCFA before recovering any overpayments. </p>
