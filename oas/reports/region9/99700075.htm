<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>We determined that Sutter misclassified costs on its Medicare cost reports 
  and incorrectly billed for ancillary medical supplies. We found that about 39&nbsp;percent 
  of costs for ancillary medical supplies were misclassified and about 7&nbsp;percent 
  of items billed as ancillary medical supplies were actually routine supplies. 
  We also noted that Sutter incorrectly classified $282,018 of supply accounts 
  resulting in excessive ancillary costs. We recommended that Sutter determine 
  the fiscal impact for the incorrectly claimed costs, the billing errors, and 
  the $282,018 of incorrectly classified supply accounts, and make an appropriate 
  refund to Medicare. </p>
