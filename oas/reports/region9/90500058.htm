<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Hawaii’s reported Medicaid expenditures for services
  provided to beneficiaries in nursing facilities complied with Federal and State requirements
  for the period July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004.&nbsp; In general, Hawaii’s reported Medicaid
  expenditures for services provided to beneficiaries in nursing facilities complied with Federal
  and State requirements.&nbsp; However, Hawaii overpaid nursing facilities for a small number
  of ancillary services and could not support the reasonableness of its negotiated prospective
  payment system (PPS) rates for subacute care. &nbsp;We recommended that (1) Hawaii refund
  $9,532 to the Federal Government, representing the Federal share of the overpayments related
  to ancillary services, and (2) enforce the Hawaii Administrative Rules to require nursing
  facilities to separately account for subacute care costs on their cost reports so that Hawaii
  can ensure that its negotiated PPS rates are reasonable.&nbsp; Hawaii officials agreed with
  our findings and recommendations.</p>
