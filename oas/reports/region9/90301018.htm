<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p >The objective of this audit was to determine whether the AIDS Office, a Ryan White Title I grantee, ensured that Continuum
  HIV Day Services (Continuum), one of its adult day health care contractors (1) provided the expected program services to
  clients eligible for CARE Act Title I and (2) followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under CARE Act Title
  I. &nbsp;For two of three programs at Continuum, the AIDS Office ensured that Continuum provided the expected program services
  and followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under CARE Act Title I.&nbsp; However, for the remaining program
  (Integrative Services), Continuum did not have documentation to support that some program services were provided and did
  not follow Federal requirements for claiming costs. &nbsp;In addition to three procedural recommendations, we recommended
  that the AIDS Office refund $42,625 to the Federal Government, the total amount reimbursed to Continuum in excess of allowable
  program costs.</p>
