<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of State agency controls 
  over Medicaid payments for clinical laboratory services. The review disclosed 
  that, although the State agency had numerous edits for detecting duplicate and 
  other inappropriate billings, additional edits were needed in the Medicaid claims 
  processing system. The review identified ovepayments related to laboratory tests 
  that were inappropriately billed separately when they should have been billed 
  only as part of a group of tests (bundled services). We estimated that, if the 
  State agency were to implement additional edits to detect problems with bundling 
  or duplication, about $1.8 million in Federal and State funds could be saved 
  for the Medicaid program over a period of 5 years. </p>
