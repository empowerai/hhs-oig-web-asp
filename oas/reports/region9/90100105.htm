<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p >This report provides the results of our review of grant number 09CX2013 awarded
  to the Center for Positive Prevention Alternatives, Inc. (CPPA) by the U.S.
  Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families
  (ACF).&nbsp; The CPPA was awarded a Transitional Living Program grant in the
  amount of $200,000 each year, or $600,000 total, for the 3-year period November
  1, 1996 through October 31, 1999, to provide shelter and non-shelter services
  to runaway and homeless youth.&nbsp; The objectives of our audit were to assess
  CPPA’s (i) performance in achieving the service and reporting objectives as
  defined in the grant application approved by ACF, and (ii) compliance with
  the terms and conditions of the grant applicable to those objectives.&nbsp; Our
  audit found problems in the documentation of services, client data in the national
  Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information System (RHYMIS) database,
  and completeness of information in the quarterly performance reports, as well
  as, submission of the final report to ACF. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">We
  made a series of recommendations intended to help strengthen CPPA’s management
  controls.</span></p>
