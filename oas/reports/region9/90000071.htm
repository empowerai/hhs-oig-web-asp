<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our audit of claims by podiatrists
  and optometrists for comprehensive nursing facility (CNF) assessments during
  Calendar Years 1995 through 1998. We found that Texas podiatrists and optometrists
  inappropriately billed Medicare for CNF assessment services totaling $3,939,316
  and $2,191,830, respectively. TrailBlazer paid $2,166,213 and $1,316,246 for
  their claims. We recommended that TrailBlazer: (1) issue a reminder to podiatrists
  and optometrists not to bill for any service they are not licensed to perform,
  and (2) implement computer edits to prevent payment of CNF assessments claimed
  by podiatrists and optometrists. TrailBlazer agreed with our audit findings
  and recommendations, and have implemented the recommended corrective actions.
  We have requested that TrailBlazer not seek recovery of the overpayments at
  this time as we are still evaluating the issue. </p>
