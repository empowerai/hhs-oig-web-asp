<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service 
  claims paid in California for beneficiaries identified as incarcerated during 
  the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with 
  federal regulations and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ (CMS) 
  guidelines.&nbsp; California was 1 of 10 states selected for review.&nbsp; We 
  audited a random sample of 100 Medicare fee-for-service claims for beneficiaries 
  identified as incarcerated during the 3-year audit period to determine whether 
  these payments were appropriate.&nbsp; We found that our sample of 100 claims 
  included 58 allowable claims, 12 unallowable claims and 30 claims for which 
  the allowability of the claim could not be determined.&nbsp; Medicare paid for 
  the 12 unallowable claims because the prisoner data from the Social Security 
  Administration (SSA) was not contained in CMS’ records, which are used by the 
  Medicare contractors to process claims.</p>
<p>We have been informed that CMS plans to establish an edit 
  in the common working file that will deny claims for incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; 
  Claims meeting the conditions of payment will not be subject to this edit if 
  the supplier or provider submitting the claim certifies, by using a modifier 
  or condition code on the claim, that he or she has been instructed by the state 
  or local government component that the conditions for Medicare payment have 
  been met.&nbsp; We recommended that CMS:&nbsp; (1) make a concerted effort to 
  educate suppliers and providers on the meaning of the modifier or condition 
  code and circumstances relating to their proper use, (2) monitor claims with 
  the modifier or condition code to assure that federal guidelines are met, and 
  (3) monitor claims to ensure that only commitment codes that meet Medicare criteria 
  are paid and that uniform collection procedures are enforced.&nbsp; The CMS 
  concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
