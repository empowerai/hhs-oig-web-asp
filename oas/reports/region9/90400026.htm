<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Maricopa Integrated Health System Health Plans&nbsp;(Maricopa) complied
  with M+C prompt payment regulations to timely pay or deny claims submitted by noncontracted providers during the period
  May&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2003 through October&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2003.&nbsp; Maricopa’s compliance with prompt payment regulations could
  not be determined because its claims processing data was inaccurate and incomplete.&nbsp; The data was inaccurate and incomplete
  because Maricopa did not (1) design and implement an electronic claims processing system that properly processed M+C claims
  and (2) establish adequate policies and procedures to record information necessary to properly track claims in its manual
  claims processing system.&nbsp; After completion of our fieldwork, Maricopa initiated a search for an outside contractor
  to process claims.&nbsp; We recommended that Maricopa (1) design and implement an electronic system, or contract with an
  outside organization, to process M+C claims correctly; and (2) establish adequate policies and procedures to ensure that
  all information recorded in the M+C claims processing systems is accurate and complete.&nbsp; Maricopa concurred with our
  findings.</p>
