<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether (1) Oregon calculated its State Fiscal Years (SFYs)
  2002 and 2003 upper payment limits (UPL) for non-State government nursing facilities in accordance with Federal regulations
  and the approved state plan amendments and (2) Oregon&#8217;s estimated Medicaid payments for SFYs 2004 and 2005 were within
  the UPLs.&nbsp; We found that Oregon did not calculate the SFYs 2002 and 2003 UPLs for non-State government nursing facilities
  in accordance with Federal regulations and its approved State plan amendments.&nbsp; Oregon&#8217;s Medicaid payments to
  non-State government nursing facilities exceeded the UPLs by more than $230.5 million ($137.2 million Federal share) in
  SFYs 2002 and 2003.&nbsp; In addition, Oregon&#8217;s estimated Medicaid payments for SFYs 2004 and 2005 could exceed our
  projected UPLs per Federal regulations by $76.3 million ($45.9 million Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that Oregon
  reduce claimed expenses on its CMS-64 quarterly expenditure reports by $230,538,269 ($137,219,260 Federal share) for SFYs
  2002 and 2003 and calculate UPLs in accordance with Federal regulations to prevent Federal overpayments of $45.9 million
  for SFYs 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; Oregon agreed in part with our findings and recommendations, but disagreed with the Federal
  share to be returned.</p>
