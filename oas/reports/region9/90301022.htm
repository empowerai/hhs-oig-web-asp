<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the Los Angeles County
  Department of Health Services (LA County):&nbsp; (i) properly recorded, summarized
  and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus area
  designated in the cooperative agreements, (ii) established controls and procedures
  to monitor subrecipients’ expenditures of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC) funds; and (iii) used bioterrorism program (Program) funds to supplant
  funds previously provided by other sources.&nbsp; We found that:&nbsp; (i)
  LA County did not properly report Program expenditures to CDC for the two reporting
  periods ended August 30, 2000 and 2001, (ii) had not conducted on site monitoring
  reviews because the subrecipients were generally in the planning stage; and
  (iii) had not used Program funding to supplant existing State or local funds.&nbsp; We
  recommended that LA County:&nbsp; (i) submit final Financial Status Reports
  that include actual expenditures with no outstanding obligations for reporting
  periods ended August 30, 2000 and 2001 and ensure that, in the future, final
  Financial Status Reports are submitted for reporting periods required by CDC;
  and (ii) implement the subrecipient monitoring procedures as planned.&nbsp; LA
  County officials concurred with our recommendations.</p>
