<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective 
  of this review was to determine whether bad debts claimed on federal fiscal 
  year 1999 Medicare cost reports at California hospitals, for which Mutual of 
  Omaha was the fiscal intermediary, were for bad debts previously paid as part 
  of a settlement agreement between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
  and the California Department of Health Services.&nbsp; Of the three hospitals 
  reviewed, we found that all three hospitals claimed bad debts totaling $36,814 
  on their Medicare cost reports that was previously paid as part of the settlement 
  agreement.</p>
