<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of medical and ancillary claims 
  for 21 to 64 year old residents of private psychiatric hospitals that are institutions 
  for mental diseases in California during the period of July 1, 1997 through 
  January 31, 2001.&nbsp; This audit is part of our ongoing review of Medicaid 
  billings for patients in institutions for mental diseases (IMD).&nbsp; The objective 
  of our review was to determine if the state of California had adequate controls 
  to preclude claiming federal financial participation (FFP) under the Medicaid 
  program when 21 to 64 year old residents of private IMDs received physician 
  services, laboratory and clinic services, and hospital outpatient treatment.&nbsp; 
  Federal Medicaid law and regulations prohibit FFP for this care.&nbsp; We determined 
  that although the state did not have specific edits to prevent it from claiming 
  FFP, only a minor amount of unallowable FFP was claimed under Medicaid for medical 
  and ancillary services.&nbsp; We concluded that the state substantially complied 
  with federal rules prohibiting claims of FFP under the Medicaid program for 
  medical and ancillary services provided to residents 21 to 64 year old in the 
  state’s 26 private psychiatric hospitals that were IMDs.</p>
