<p> <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> <br wp="br1" />
  <br />
  This final audit report presents the results of our audit of claims by podiatrists
  and optometrists for comprehensive nursing facility (CNF) assessments during
  Calendar Years 1995 through 1998. We found that podiatrists and optometrists
  were not licensed to perform CNF assessments. Nonetheless, podiatrists and
  optometrists submitted claims for these services totaling $4,821,810 and $517,461,
  respectively. Empire paid $2,905,205 and $320,896 for their claims. We recommended
  that Empire: (1) issue a reminder to podiatrists and optometrists not to bill
  for any service outside of the scope of their medical licenses, such as CNF
  assessments, and (2) implement computer edits to prevent payment of CNF assessments
  claimed by podiatrists and optometrists. Empire representatives agreed with
  our audit findings and recommendations, and have implemented the recommended
  corrective actions. We have requested that Empire not seek recovery of the
  overpayments at this time as we are still evaluating the issue.</p>
