<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>A prior audit disclosed that California claimed an estimated $103.4 million 
  ($51.7 million Federal share) for ineligible and improper foster care maintenance 
  payments during the 3-year period ending September 30, 1991. A financial adjustment 
  was not recommended at that time due to a moratorium imposed by the Congress 
  on seeking repayments of Federal funds under the title IV-E program. The moratorium 
  has now expired, and the State has provided supplemental information to the 
  Administration for Children and Families (ACF) regarding the previous questionable 
  cases. At the request of ACF, we have performed a follow-on review of the information 
  submitted by the State. The review disclosed that the amount inappropriately 
  claimed now totals approximately $78 million ($39 million Federal share). We 
  are recommending a financial adjustment for the $39 million. </p>
