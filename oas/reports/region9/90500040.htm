</p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether St. Joseph Hospital’s (the hospital)
  complied with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its fiscal year (FY) 2004
  Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital did not fully comply with Medicare requirements
  for reporting wage data in its FY 2004 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; Specifically, the hospital
  overstated wage data by $1,747,585 and 473,370 hours.&nbsp; As a result of our review, the
  hospital filed an amended FY&nbsp;2004 Medicare cost report, which adjusted the wage data
  by $471,941 and 446,117 hours.&nbsp; However, $1,275,644 of wages and 27,253 related hours
  remained overstated in the cost report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the hospital:&nbsp; (1) submit a revised FY 2004 Medicare cost report
  to the fiscal intermediary to correct the remaining wage data overstatements totaling $1,275,644
  and 27,253 hours, and (2) implement review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the
  wage data reported in future Medicare cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in compliance
  with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; The hospital agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
