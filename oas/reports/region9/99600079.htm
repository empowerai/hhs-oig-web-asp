<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report discloses that Health Care Management's (HCM) billings to Medicare 
  for ancillary medical supplies used in its three skilled nursing facilities 
  (SNFs) were generally in compliance with Medicare's rules, but that significant 
  costs were misclassified as ancillary on the medicare cost reports for the 2-year 
  period ended December 31, 1994. The costs should have been classified as routine. 
</p>
<p>We did not quantify the financial impact of misclassified costs as our review 
  was limited to determining what types of items and services that were claimed 
  as ancillary were unallowable as such. </p>
<p>We recommended that Mutual of Omaha ensure that HCM submits revised cost reports 
  for its three SNFs and that the revised cost reports reclassify all costs for 
  routine items and services that were previously claimed an ancillary medical 
  supplies. </p>
