<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>In California, a portion of the Medicaid program was operated under a Federal waiver known as the Selective
  Provider Contracting Program (program).&nbsp; The program allowed&nbsp; the State to contract with selected hospitals to
  provide inpatient services to Medicaid patients at negotiated rates of reimbursement.&nbsp; The negotiated rates were typically
  less than hospitals would have received under traditional Medicaid rules.&nbsp; The State used these lower rates to project
  savings under the waiver.&nbsp; Based on the savings projected, the State made supplemental payments to hospitals requesting
  additional funding.&nbsp; For our audit period, July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2002, the State projected program savings
  of $7 billion (direct savings of $4.8 billion and indirect savings of $2.2 billion) and made supplemental payments of $6.2
  billion.</p>
<p>Our audit objectives were to evaluate the reasonableness of the methodologies the State used to project
  program savings and the adequacy of the State's support documentation for its savings projections.&nbsp; We found that
  the State's projection methodologies contained errors.&nbsp; As a result, the State's direct and indirect savings were
  overstated.&nbsp; In addition, the State did not maintain adequate documentation to support its savings projections.&nbsp; Because
  the savings projections were inaccurate and inadequately documented, the State could not demonstrate the program's cost-effectiveness
  as required by the waiver.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) develop appropriate projection methodologies
  to address the concerns raised in this report; (2) recalculate projected program savings for the 4-year period ended June
  30, 2002; (3) determine whether supplemental payments exceeded recalculated savings and refund the appropriate Federal
  share; and (4) ensure that adequate documentation is maintained to support savings projections for the 4-year period ended
  June 30, 2002 and all subsequent period of the waiver.</p>
