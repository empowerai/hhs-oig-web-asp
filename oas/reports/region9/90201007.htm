<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the California Department of Health Services (DHS) did not account
  for bioterrorism program funds ($4.9 million received for the 2-year period ending August 30, 2001) by focus area as required
  by the cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nor could it adequately support
  program expenditures on financial reports submitted to CDC.&nbsp; Specifically, DHS; 1) did not organize its accounting
  system to record, summarize, and report expenditures by program focus area, 2) relied on summary spreadsheets maintained
  outside the accounting system to prepare financial reports, 3) did not have adequate controls over the preparation and
  review of financial reports, and 4) did not adequately monitor sub-recipients.&nbsp; In addition to recommendations to
  correct accounting and procedural weaknesses, we recommended that DHS determine, in coordination with the CDC, the amount
  of bioterrorism program funds that were expended in each focus area, identify unallowable costs, and make adjustments to
  current and future awards so that funds are rebalanced by focus area to provide appropriate levels of preparedness.&nbsp; The
  DHS concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
