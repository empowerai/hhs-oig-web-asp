<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether organ acquisition costs claimed by California Pacific
  on its calendar years 1998, 1999, and 2000 Medicare Part A cost reports for its kidney, liver, heart, and pancreas transplant
  programs were allowable.&nbsp; California Pacific did not comply with Medicare law, regulations, and guidelines for claiming
  organ acquisition costs and received excess Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; California Pacific
  claimed $710,457 in unallowable costs and $7,387,659 in unsupported costs.&nbsp; The estimated Medicare overpayments for
  the unallowable and unsupported costs were $391,413 and $3,340,339, respectively.&nbsp; The unallowable costs were associated
  with activities that did not comply with Medicare&#8217;s definition of organ acquisition.&nbsp; The unsupported costs
  did not comply with Medicare&#8217;s documentation requirements for reimbursement.&nbsp; We recognize that some portion
  of the unsupported costs may have related to organ acquisition activities and would have been allowable if properly documented.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the Medicare intermediary recover the Medicare overpayment, determine the allowability of the unsupported
  costs, review organ acquisition costs claimed for other fiscal years, monitor future claims, and have California Pacific
  develop accounting controls and training programs.</p>
