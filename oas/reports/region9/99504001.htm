<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report discloses that although the University of California Berkeley's 
  (UCB) policies and procedures were generally consistent with OMB Circular A-21, 
  UCB did not adequately control and monitor recharge center operations to ensure 
  compliance. Specifically, our review disclosed that: (1) three recharge centers 
  accumulated large surplus fund balances, resulting in $400,120 of excess charges 
  to federally sponsored projects, (2) one recharge center inappropriately transferred 
  surplus funds out of its operating account of unrelated purposes; (3) two recharge 
  centers charged the cost of capital equipment purchases to current operating 
  funds; (4) one recharge center used unapproved billing rates; and (5) most recharge 
  centers were not credited for interest income earned on their cash balances.
