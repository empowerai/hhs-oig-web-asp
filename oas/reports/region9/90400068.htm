<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether costs that Santa Clara County claimed for Title IV-E
  reimbursement were allowable under Federal and State regulations. &nbsp;During the period
  January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2003, Santa Clara claimed $572,927 that was not allowable
  pursuant to Federal and State regulations, and we could not determine the allowability of
  the remaining $6,148,440.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State: (1) refund the $286,464 Federal share of unallowable costs
  claimed; (2) work with ACF to determine what portion of the $6,148,440 ($3,074,220 Federal
  share) is allowable under Title IV-E and refund the Federal share; &nbsp;(3) review costs
  that Santa Clara claimed subsequent to the audit period for similar issues and refund the
  Federal share of any unallowable costs identified; and (4) instruct Santa Clara to strengthen
  its internal controls.&nbsp; The State agreed to refund $279,042 (Federal share), but did
  not concur with $14,844 of the $572,927 of unallowable costs.&nbsp; The State also did not
  concur with the second recommendation, but did agree with the last two.</p>
