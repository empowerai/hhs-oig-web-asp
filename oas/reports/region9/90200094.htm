<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Federal regulations require that States pursue Aid to Families with Dependent Children overpayments
  made prior to October 1, 1996, and make appropriate refunds to the Federal Government.&nbsp; This final report points out
  that California had not made such refunds for overpayments collected by San Diego County (estimated at approximately $5.3
  million Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment for the $5.3 million and procedural corrections.&nbsp; The
  State generally concurred with our recommendations. </p>
