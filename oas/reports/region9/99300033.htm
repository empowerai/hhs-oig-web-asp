<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final audit report points out how trusts are used to shelter assets and
  prevent Medicaid from being reimbursed medical costs of recipients receiving
  third party liability settlements and awards. Thirty-six State agencies disclosed
  that trusts were used by Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients
  to shelter assets. The agencies also reported that the use of these trusts
  was growing. Although we were unable to determine the financial impact of these
  trusts on Medicaid nationally, the impact on Medicaid of just 25 such trusts
  in California was significant--$3 million in unrecovered program costs. We
  recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration propose legislative
  amendments to address this issue. The HCFA agreed that current law contains
  certain loopholes and that it could recommend to the Congress provisions to
  close such loopholes in the legislation. </p>
