<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objective of this audit was to determine if controls were in place to preclude California from claiming Federal Medicaid
  funds for medical services, except inpatient psychiatric services, provided to residents under age 21 in private psychiatric
  hospitals that were institutions for mental diseases.&nbsp; We found that California improperly claimed Federal funds because
  it did not have controls to prevent claims for medical services.&nbsp; As a result, from July 1, 1997, through January
  31, 2001, we estimate that California improperly claimed $310,266 ($155,133 Federal share) for such medical services.&nbsp; We
  recommended that California (1) refund $155,133 to the Federal Government; (2) implement controls to prevent Federal funds
  from being claimed for such medical services; and (3) identify and refund to the Federal Government any Federal Medicaid
  funds improperly claimed after January 31, 2001.</p>
