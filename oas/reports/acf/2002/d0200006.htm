<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p> This final report provides the results of our review of the Administration
  for Children and Families grant number 90EE0189 awarded to the Corinthian Housing
  Development Corporation (CHDC) for the period September 1996 through September
  2000.&nbsp; In general, CHDC did not accomplish its grant objectives and did
  not always comply with the standard terms and conditions of the grant or manage
  funds properly.&nbsp; Specifically, the proposed health and education center
  was not developed; jobs were not created; progress reports were not submitted
  timely; the executive director's salary and pre-award costs were improperly
  paid from the grant; other contracted services were not adequately segregated
  from the corporate business funds, and a $16,680 check to cover architectural
  expenditures did not have any required signatures.&nbsp; We recommended financial
  adjustments and improvements to internal controls.</p>
