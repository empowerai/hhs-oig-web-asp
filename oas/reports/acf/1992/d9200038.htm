<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This is a final report on the Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) 
  review of State automated data processing (ADP) cost-benefit analysis reports. 
  The Office of Inspector General, as a participant in a joint study led by the 
  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), independently assessed the reporting 
  and use of cost-benefit information provided by States after ADP implementation. 
  We concluded that while some of these reports contained useful management information, 
  they failed to accurately account for all costs and benefits and did not make 
  the required comparison between estimated and actual costs and benefits to date. 
  In reviewing the ACF files, we cold not find documentation that ACF staff had 
  analyzed the reports sufficiently to detect the shortcomings we observed. </p>
