<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our follow-up review of the Office 
  of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) Repatriation Program (RP). We found that the recommendations 
  from our previous report were implemented. The ORR had taken steps to improve 
  the receipt of billing reports, but States were still submitting reports late, 
  and in a small number of cases without adequate documentation. We also observed 
  that the RP had not established an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. 
  As much as 90 percent of the accounts receivable were not collected. As a result, 
  the accounts receivable as reported to the Department and external agencies 
  was overstated. The Assistant Secretary for Children and Families concurred 
  with our report. </p>
