<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Administration 
  for Children and Families (ACF) controls over contracts. The Office of Inspector 
  General is required to provide an annual report to Congress on: (1) the accuracy 
  and completeness of data provided to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) 
  and (2) the Department's progress implementing controls over contracts for advisory 
  and assistance services (CAAS). The Department understated ACF's FY 1991 overall 
  new contracting activity of $18.3 million by $15.6 million in the FPDS. Of this 
  amount, ACF's use of $5.5 million in CAAS contract actions was understated by 
  $4.3 million in the FY 1991 FPDS data. Additionally, some CAAS contract files 
  did not have the documentation showing proper approval and justification. </p>
