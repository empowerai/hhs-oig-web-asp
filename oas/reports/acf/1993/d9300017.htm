<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Administration 
  for Children and Families' (ACF) oversight of an Office of Community Services 
  (OCS) $472,500 discretionary grant awarded to the Haitian Task Force, Inc (HTF) 
  located in Miami, Florida. The report points out that the grantee failed to: 
  (1) purchase property needed to accomplish grant goals, (2) obtain community 
  support and accomplish a planned marketplace expansion, or (3) create business 
  opportunities and employment opportunities for low-income individuals as planned 
  in the approved grant. We found that ACF did not effectively manage the grant, 
  monitor grantee actions, and provide adequate oversight. The grantee's problems 
  were clearly indicated in information we found in ACF headquarters files and 
  should have been detected and caused ACF to devote increased oversight and technical 
  assistance to the project early in the grant period. </p>
