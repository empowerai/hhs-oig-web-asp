<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report presents the results of our audit of training contract costs claimed 
  for Federal reimbursement by the Washington State Department of Social and Health 
  Services. The training was provided to State employees with responsibilities 
  in the social and health service areas to provide the staff with the necessary 
  skills to accomplish the objectives of the various programs administered by 
  the Department. Although many training needs were met through internal resources, 
  a substantial amount of training was obtained through contracts with outside 
  organizations such as educational institutions and independent contractors. 
</p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if training contract costs claimed by the Department 
  of Social and Health Services for Federal reimbursement were allowable under 
  Federal regulations and policies. Specifically, we wanted to determine if the 
  State:</p>
<ul>
  <li>claimed third-party contributions as the State's required matching share 
    of training contract costs only as allowed by Federal regulations,
  </li>
  <li>adequately documented and supported the matching share of training contract 
    costs claimed for Federal reimbursement, and
  </li>
  <li>appropriately allocated training contract costs between federally participating 
    and nonparticipating programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Department of Social and Health Services claimed Federal reimbursement 
  of $5.6 million for unallowable costs relating to staff training contracts with 
  performance periods during the period July 1, 1989 through June 30, 1995. The 
  unallowable costs related to six contracts with Western Washington University 
  (WWU), which was the largest external resource utilized for the staff training 
  during our audit period. We found that the State (i) used unallowable third-party 
  contributions to meet the matching requirements under certain Federal programs, 
  (ii) claimed costs for WWU employees in excess of actual costs incurred, (iii) 
  claimed unallowable costs for facilities, equipment, and other miscellaneous 
  items, and (iv) did not always properly allocate training costs between federally 
  participating and nonparticipating programs. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the Department of Social and Health Services implement 
  various procedural changes and improvements to ensure that unallowable costs 
  are not claimed for Federal reimbursement under staff training contracts, and 
  that the State refund $5,627,391 to the Federal Government. We are also recommending 
  that the State determine the amount of third-party contributions inappropriately 
  claimed subsequent to our audit period and make a financial adjustment to refund 
  the additional amounts overclaimed. </p>
<p>In response to the draft report, Department of Social and Health Services officials 
  agreed to refund $1,287,158, and disagreed with recommendations for refunding 
  the balance of $4,340,233. The agreed-on amounts included $53,818 of unallowable 
  third-party in-kind contributions; $1,002,109 of overclaimed employee costs; 
  $189,983 of overclaimed or duplicated costs for space, equipment and administration; 
  and, $41,248 of improperly allocated costs. The disagreed-on amount represents 
  recommended refunds for unallowable third-party in-kind contributions. The State 
  officials disagreed with the procedural recommendations in the report involving 
  third-party in-kind contributions except for the recommendations involving the 
  Refugee Resettlement program. The State officials also did not agree with our 
  recommendation for identifying and refunding third-party contributions inappropriately 
  claimed subsequent to our audit period. The basis for disagreement was generally 
  the interpretation of the provisions of Federal regulations and other criteria 
  for the various Federal programs included in the audit. </p>
<p>We have summarized the Department of Social and Health Services comments and 
  the Office of Audit Services response to those comments, as appropriate, after 
  each finding discussed in the report. </p>
