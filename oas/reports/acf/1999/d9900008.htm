<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that District of Columbia agencies' policies and 
  practices for receiving, tracking, and investigating allegations of abuse and 
  neglect did not provide adequate safeguards for protecting District residents 
  with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities. Specifically, we 
  found that District agencies were not adequately tracking, or, in many instances, 
  not promptly investigating reported incidents and that the existing policies 
  and practices did not ensure that residential facility operators or other service 
  providers always reported incidents. As a result, we concluded that residents 
  receiving services from District agencies have not been adequately protected 
  and remain at risk until needed safeguards are implemented. Recommendations 
  focused on improvements to, and implementation of, needed safeguards. District 
  officials generally concurred with our recommendations and specified actions 
  they are taking to improve services to residents and establish such safeguards.
