<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of Unique Supplies, A 
  Working Capital Fund (WCF) Activity. Our review disclosed that Unique Supplies 
  is having and will continue to have problems in recovering costs unless significant 
  changes in operations are instituted. The activity has shown losses of $51,308, 
  $205,428, and $94,744 in Fiscal Years 1989, 1990 and mid-year 1991 respectively. 
  We determined the losses were caused by selling the majority of products at 
  or below cost thereby failing to recover costs and overhead. We also found inventory 
  was inadequate because valuations of items were not current and internal controls 
  were weak. </p>
