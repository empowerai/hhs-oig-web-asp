<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) did not 
  accurately report FY 1999 performance results and did not have an adequate system 
  for validating the information presented in its performance report.&nbsp; Our 
  conclusion was based on exceptions we found in a judgmental sample of 63 of 
  209 review or investigation dockets. &nbsp; We recommended that OCR:&nbsp; (1) 
  issue guidance to its regional offices to ensure that performance results are 
  accurately and consistently reported; (2) enhance its data validation process 
  to ensure that future performance results are reliable; and (3) review and, 
  where appropriate, clarify the explanations and description of performance measures 
  and reported results in future performance plans.&nbsp; The OCR is taking steps 
  to improve the accuracy and verification of data in the FY 2000 GPRA report 
  and subsequent years' reports.</p>
