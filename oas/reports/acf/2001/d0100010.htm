<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of New York's Participation 
  in Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act, Promoting Safe and Stable 
  Families in Fiscal Years (FY) 1994 through 2001.&nbsp; The objectives of our 
  review were to determine: &nbsp; (1) the reasons why New York officials did 
  not use all Federal funds available to them during part of this time period, 
  and (2) if New York met its cost sharing requirements during the years it participated 
  in the program.&nbsp; While New York participated in Title IV-B, Subpart 2 in 
  Federal FYs 1994 through 1996, New York did not use $167,089 of its FY 1994 
  grant award.&nbsp; According to New York officials, one of the 58 counties in 
  the State did not use its allotment of Title IV-B, Subpart 2 funds. &nbsp; Further, 
  New York met its required 25 percent State cost match in FYs 1995 and 1996 even 
  though its (initial) expenditure report did not indicate that it did.</p>
