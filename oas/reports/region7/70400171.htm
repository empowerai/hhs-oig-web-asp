<p>The objective of this review was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement for
  Fiscal Years (FY) 1992 through 1997. &nbsp;We found that Pennsylvania Blue Shield (PBS) did not incur nor claim pension
  costs for FYs 1992 and 1993.&nbsp; However, PBS underclaimed allowable Medicare pension costs for FYs 1994 through 1997.&nbsp; During
  this period, the allowable Medicare pension costs were $8,271,992.&nbsp; However, PBS claimed pension costs of $4,978,167
  for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; The underclaim occurred because PBS did not correctly identify its Medicare segment in
  accordance with its Medicare contract.&nbsp; As a result, PBS did not claim $3,293,825 of allowable pension costs. &nbsp;We
  recommended that PBS revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) to claim allowable CAS pension costs of $3,293,825
  for FY 1994 through 1997.</p>
