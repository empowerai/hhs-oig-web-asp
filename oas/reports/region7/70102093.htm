<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final audit report points out that the State of Missouri overstated its 
  disproportionate share hospital (DSH) claims by $36.2 million (federal share) 
  for State Fiscal Year 1999. Contrary to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
  of 1993 (OBRA), the State included nonhospital (community mental health center) 
  costs in the DSH calculations. We recommended a financial adjustment for the 
  $36.2 million. We also recommended that the State identify and refund similar 
  excessive claims from subsequent years, and implement procedures and controls 
  to prevent similar types of DSH claims in future periods. The State did not 
  concur, contending that the nonhospital costs were allowable.</p>
