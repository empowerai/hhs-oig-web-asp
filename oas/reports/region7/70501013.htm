<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if Health Net reported beneficiaries as institutionalized for enhanced Medicare reimbursement pursuant to Federal laws and regulations. &nbsp;<a>We found that </a> Health Net incorrectly reported 82 beneficiaries as institutionalized for enhanced Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, Health Net received Medicare overpayments of $293,885.&nbsp; The errors occurred because Health Net did not have adequate internal controls to ensure that it correctly classified beneficiaries as institutionalized.</p>
<p>We recommended Health Net refund $293,885 to the Federal Government and ensure that its controls are adequate to correctly classify beneficiaries as institutionalized pursuant to Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; Health Net concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
