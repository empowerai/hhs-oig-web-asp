<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>:</p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Kansas developed the payment rates for Medicaid school-based
  health services pursuant to Federal requirements and the State plan.&nbsp; Kansas did not
  develop the payment rates for Medicaid school-based health services pursuant to Federal requirements
  and the State plan.&nbsp; Kansas used incorrect indirect cost rates and service utilization
  data to develop the payment rates.&nbsp; The payments to school districts for FYs 1998-2003
  were incorrect, and Kansas received $18.5 million of overpayments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that Kansas refund $18.5 million to the Federal Government, calculate and
  refund all overpayments that occurred subsequent to our audit period, and develop and implement
  adequate internal controls to ensure that future Federal claims for school-based services
  are consistent with Federal requirements and the State plan.&nbsp; In its comments on our
  draft report, Kansas concurred with the findings and two of the recommendations.&nbsp; Kansas
  did not address our recommendation to calculate and refund all overpayments that occurred
  subsequent to our audit period.</p>
