<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of our analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of Empire Medicare 
  Services' claims processing system in identifying payment reductions for multiple 
  ambulatory surgical center procedures for calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; 
  Regulations require that when multiple services are provided in the same operative 
  session, the highest paying procedure is reimbursable at the full payment rate 
  while the other procedures are reimbursable at one-half the normal payment rate.&nbsp; 
  Our analysis showed that Empire Medicare Services’ systems failed to identify 
  such instances, which resulted in provider overpayments for calendar years 1997 
  through 2001of approximately $5,997, $16,507, $39,525, $40,165, and&nbsp; $23,888 
  ($126,082), respectively.&nbsp; Included in the identified overpayments is approximately 
  $25,482 in beneficiary overpayments for coinsurance.&nbsp; Most of the overpayments 
  occurred because the carrier’s processing system did not identify multiple procedures 
  performed during the same session when submitted on separate claims.</p>
