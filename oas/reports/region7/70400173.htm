<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to: &nbsp;(1) determine if the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our
  prior review (A-07-93-00713) have been accounted for properly, (2) determine if pension costs for plan years 1992 through
  1996 were funded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and
  (3) identify and properly account for any additional accumulated unfunded pension costs, including the identification of
  the unallowable and reassignable portions of the accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; We found that Pennsylvania Blue
  Shield (PBS) properly accounted for the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our prior review and properly
  executed its Advance Agreement.&nbsp; Additionally, PBS funded the pension costs for plan years 1992 through 1996 in accordance
  with FAR and CAS.&nbsp; However, PBS did not correctly identify nor properly account for the additional accumulated unfunded
  pension costs due to the lack of adequate policies and procedures.&nbsp; We recommended that PBS decrease the accumulated
  reassignable pension costs of the Medicare segment by $2,154,481 as of December 31, 1996.</p>
