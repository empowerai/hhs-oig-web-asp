<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (Empire), a CMS contractor, correctly calculated and claimed zero pension costs 
for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1999 through 2004; however, it 
claimed $794,333 of unallowable Medicare pension costs for FYs 2005 and 
2006. &nbsp;This error occurred primarily as a result of the increase in the Medicare 
segment actuarial value of assets.&nbsp; This increase caused the assignable 
pension costs to be zero for both FYs. &nbsp;As a result, Empire claimed $794,333 of 
unallowable pension costs for Medicare reimbursement for FYs 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Empire revise its Final Administrative 
Cost Proposals for FYs 2005 and 2006 or otherwise credit CMS to reduce its 
claimed pension costs by $794,333.
&nbsp;Empire’s Medicare contract was transferred to 
National Government Systems (NGS) effective January 1, 2007.&nbsp; NGS concurred 
with the finding and recommendation and stated that it would effectuate payment 
at the time of a settlement with CMS.</p>
