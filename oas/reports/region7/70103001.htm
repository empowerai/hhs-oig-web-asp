<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM) served as a Medicare contractor 
  until their contract was terminated in July 1999.&nbsp; Federal regulations 
  and Medicare contract provisions require pension gains, which occur when a Medicare 
  segment of a contractor's pension plan closes, be credited to the Medicare program.&nbsp; 
  We identified $2.0 million in excess Medicare pension assets at BCBSM at the 
  time of contract termination.&nbsp; Our methodology and calculations were reviewed 
  by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' pension actuarial staff.&nbsp; 
  We are recommending that BCBSM refund the $2.0 million to the Medicare program.
