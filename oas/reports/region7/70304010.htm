<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the four State agencies in Region VII (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and
  Nebraska) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over their respective Medicaid drug rebate programs. &nbsp;Individual
  reports were issued to each State agency, and this report summarizes the issues identified in those reports. </p>
<p>Three of the State agencies had not established adequate accountability and controls over their Medicaid drug rebate programs.&nbsp; As
  a result, there was no assurance that all drug rebates due to those States were collected.&nbsp; Missouri had generally
  established adequate controls and procedures. Specific recommendations were made to each of the State agencies that addressed
  the weaknesses described above.&nbsp; Missouri and Kansas generally agreed with the findings and recommendations and indicated
  that corrective action had been enacted or was planned.&nbsp; Iowa and Nebraska did not fully concur with our findings. </p>
