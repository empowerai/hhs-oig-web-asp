<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Montana’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that the State had <span style="font-size:11.5pt">partially 
corrected some of the weaknesses reported in our previous audit.</span>&nbsp; 
Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid 
funding by entering into a rebate agreement with the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services and paying quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp; However, the 
State’s accounts receivable system conversion remained incomplete.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, the State did not implement recommendations 
related to (1) tracking $0 unit rebate amounts (URA) to ensure payment; (2) 
adjusting URA information to ensure that accounts receivable records are 
accurate; and (3) actively pursuing disputed drug rebates, including utilization 
of the State’s hearing mechanism.&nbsp; The State had, however, established controls 
over collecting rebates on single-source drugs administered by physicians. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State complete its accounts 
receivable system conversion by determining an accurate accounts receivable 
balance for each manufacturer. &nbsp;We also recommended that the State develop and 
follow policies and procedures that include (1) tracking $0 URAs to ensure 
payment; (2) adjusting URA information to ensure that accounts receivable 
records are accurate; and (3) actively pursuing disputed drug rebates, including 
utilization of the State’s hearing mechanism.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In written comments on our draft report, the State 
generally concurred with all of our findings and recommendations.</p>
