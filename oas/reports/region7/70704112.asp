Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Resolution of Audit Recommendations
</h2>

<h2 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>We found that during fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) resolved 3,462 of the 4,650 audit recommendations that were outstanding during this period.  However, CMS did not resolve 2,813 of the 3,462 recommendations within the required 6-month period.  In addition, as of September 30, 2007, CMS had not resolved 1,188 audit recommendations that were past due for resolution.  The dollar amounts associated with these recommendations totaled $1.165 billion.  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-50 requires prompt resolution and corrective actions on audit recommendations.  Resolution shall be made within a maximum of 6 months after the issuance of a final report.  As a result of CMS not resolving all audit recommendations in a timely manner, it did not have reasonable assurance that it was exercising proper stewardship over Federal dollars.  However, CMS revised its audit resolution procedures during the audit period and has made progress in resolving outstanding audit recommendations in a more timely manner.</p>

<p>We recommended that CMS (1) resolve all audit recommendations within the required 6-month audit resolution period and (2) resolve the 1,188 outstanding audit recommendations that were past due as of September 30, 2007.  CMS concurred with our recommendations.</p>
