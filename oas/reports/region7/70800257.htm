<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Regence Group (Regence), a Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services contractor, underclaimed $260,000 of Medicare pension costs on 
its Oregon and Common Working File (CWF) Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) 
for fiscal years (FY) 1997–2006.&nbsp; Regence also underclaimed $665,000 of Medicare 
pension costs on its Utah FACPs for FYs 1998–2006.&nbsp; Regence administered 
both Medicare Part A and Part B operations under cost reimbursement contracts 
with CMS until the contractual relationship was terminated November 30, 2005.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
We recommended that Regence (1) revise its Oregon and CWF FACPs for FYs 
1997–2006 to claim the additional allowable pension costs of $260,000 and (2) 
revise its Utah FACPs for
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">FYs 1998–2006 to 
claim the additional allowable pension costs of $665,000.&nbsp; Regence concurred 
with the audit results but stated that the “. . . scope of this audit is limited 
to the Medicare Part A and Part B cost reimbursement contracts that terminated 
on November 30, 2005 and does not include the Oregon Medicare Data Center 
contract which terminated on December 31, 2006.” </span></p>
