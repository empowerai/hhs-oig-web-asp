<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our review titled, "Review of Unfunded 
  Pension Costs of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Dakota." The purpose of 
  our review was to compute interest on the January 1, 1992 accumulated unfunded 
  pension costs and to determine if pension costs allocable to the Medicare contracts 
  for plan years 1992 through 1995 were funded in accordance with the Federal 
  Acquisition Regulations (FAR). During our previous review of Blue Cross and 
  Blue Shield of North Dakota (North Dakota) (CIN: A-08-94-00740), we determined 
  that the Medicare segment accumulated $671,198 in unfunded pension costs as 
  of January 1, 1992. We recommended that North Dakota identify those unfunded 
  pension costs as an unallowable component of subsequent years' pension cost 
  calculations. We also recommended that North Dakota update the accumulated unfunded 
  pension costs, and identify and track similar costs occurring in later years.</p>
