<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of medicare contractor's 
  Pension Segmentation, Community Mutual Insurance Company (Community Mutual). 
  Our review showed that Community Mutual understated Medicare segment pension 
  assets as of 1986 by $602,838. This understatement occurred because Community 
  Mutual used an inappropriate year for their asset fraction calculation. Additionally, 
  Community Mutual's update for the Medicare segment assets from Plan Year 1986 
  to Plan Year 1995 understated segment assets by $660,350. This understatement 
  primarily occurred because Community Mutual started the update with an understated 
  asset base. We recommended that Community Mutual increase the January 1, 1995 
  assets of the Medicare segment by $1,263,188. </p>
