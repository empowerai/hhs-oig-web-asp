<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Pension Costs Claimed for 
  Medicare Reimbursement by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida (Florida). For 
  1992 and 1993, we determined that Florida has not claimed $216,113 in pension 
  costs that are allowable for Medicare reimbursement. During this period, the 
  allowable Medicare pension costs were $2,808,784. However, Florida claimed pension 
  costs of $2,592,671 for Medicare reimbursement. As a result, Florida has not 
  claimed $216,113 in allowable CAS pension costs. The under claim occurred primarily 
  because Florida based its claims on estimated pension costs as computed by their 
  consulting actuary. We recommended Florida revise its Final Administrative Cost 
  Proposals (FACPs) to claim the remaining allowable pension costs. </p>
