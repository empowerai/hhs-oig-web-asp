<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if Medicare claims submitted by Quitman Clinic for partial
  hospitalization program (PHP) services met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Medical reviewers determined that
  none of the services on 100 sampled claims met Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Because none of the sampled claims
  were eligible for Medicare reimbursement, the entire universe of 1,714 claims for the period August 1, 2000, through December
  31, 2002, totaling $12,491,797 in payments, should not have been billed to Medicare.&nbsp; We recommended that Quitman
  Clinic refund to the Medicare program $12,491,797 in unallowable payments and strengthen its procedures to ensure that
  PHP claims meet Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; While Quitman Clinic disagreed with the recommendation to repay
  the $12,491,797, it agreed to strengthen its procedures.&nbsp; </p>
