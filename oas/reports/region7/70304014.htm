<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The audit objective was to evaluate whether the Iowa Department
  of Human Services (DHS) had established adequate accountability and internal controls
  over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found that the DHS lacked sufficient
  internal controls with regard to the Medicaid drug rebate program as required by
  Federal rules and regulations.&nbsp; Drug rebate receivables were perpetually understated
  and it is likely that the DHS did not receive all drug rebates and interest on
  disputed or late rebate payments due from manufacturers.&nbsp; In addition, the
  DHS did not have reasonable assurance that drug rebate balances and collections
  reported to CMS were accurate.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of sufficient internal
  controls increased the risk for fraud, waste, or abuse of drug rebate program funds.</p>
