<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the amounts claimed by the Iowa Department of Human Services (the
  State) for Rehabilitative Treatment Services met title XXI reimbursement requirements for Federal financial participation
  (FFP).&nbsp; We identified errors in 68 of 100 sample claims and 28 of those contained multiple errors.&nbsp; Staff that
  lacked the qualifications to develop treatment goals or provide therapy and behavioral management services performed many
  of the services.&nbsp; We identified services not considered rehabilitative treatment of the client, which included general
  age-appropriate training and services provided to family members.&nbsp; In addition, services were not directed at the
  effective treatment of the client.&nbsp; Some providers did not properly support the billed services and allowed non-family
  members to be present during treatment services.&nbsp; Furthermore, we found services provided in conjunction with day
  treatment programs, services provided with insufficient staff-to-client ratios and billed services that did not meet the
  minimum requirements for core services.&nbsp; As a result, we recommended a refund of $303,276 in Medicaid FFP claimed
  for FFY 2001.</p>
