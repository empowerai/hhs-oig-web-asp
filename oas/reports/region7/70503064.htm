<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This report is part of a multistate audit.&nbsp; Our objective was to
  determine whether the State agency, Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services,
  reported Medicaid provider overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The
  State agency did not report 195 Medicaid provider overpayments totaling $3,685,465 ($2,731,303
  Federal share) in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency
  delayed reporting 68 overpayments totaling $1,278,197 ($944,216 Federal share) within required
  timeframes, resulting in $66,526 of higher interest expense to the Federal Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency: (1) include on the CMS-64 the unreported
  overpayments, the uncollected portion of overpayments that were settled at reduced amounts,
  and the unreported MFCU-identified overpayments and refund $2,731,303 Federal share; (2)
  determine the value of overpayments identified after our audit period and include them on
  the CMS-64; (3) reduce overpayments only when it can support that providers are bankrupt
  or out of business; (4) develop policies and procedures to ensure that overpayments are reported
  on the CMS-64 in accordance with Federal regulations; and (5) report all future overpayments
  within 60 days.&nbsp; The State agency agreed.</p>
