<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The purpose of this review was to determine the allowability of pension costs
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement for Fiscal Years 1992 through 2001 by Blue
  Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina.&nbsp; For this period, we determined
  that North Carolina under claimed allowable Medicare pension costs by $872,735.&nbsp; The
  allowable Medicare pension costs were $3,666,767.&nbsp; However, North Carolina
  claimed pension costs of $2,794,032 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; This
  under claim was the result of North Carolina making erroneous adjustments to
  the retirement account and not including indirect costs in the earlier years.&nbsp; We
  recommended that North Carolina revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals
  for FYs 1992 through 2002 to claim additional allowable pension costs of $872,735.</p>
