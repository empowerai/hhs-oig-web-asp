<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>CIGNA administers Medicare Part B and Durable Medical Equipment operations under cost reimbursement contracts with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and claims reimbursement for its Medicare employees&rsquo; pension costs.&nbsp;Regulations and the Medicare contracts provide guidance for claiming pension costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of pension costs that CIGNA claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1991&ndash;2004.&nbsp;CIGNA claimed $3,103,925 of unallowable pension costs for FYs 1991&ndash;2004 because it did not claim pension costs in accordance with the Medicare contracts. </p>
<p>We recommended that CIGNA revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals to reduce claimed pension costs by $3,103,925.&nbsp;We also recommended that CIGNA claim future pension costs in accordance with the Medicare contracts. CIGNA disagreed in part with our original recommendation to reduce claimed pension costs by $3,425,240 but agreed that its claimed pension costs should be reduced.&nbsp;CIGNA also agreed to claim future pension costs in accordance with the Medicare contracts.&nbsp;After reviewing CIGNA&rsquo;s comments, we revised our calculations and the related recommendation to reduce claimed pension costs.</p>
