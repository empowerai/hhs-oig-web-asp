<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the state paid claims
  for deceased Medicaid recipients during the period of our review, and, if so,
  to determine the amount of the unallowable payments.&nbsp; To accomplish our
  objective, we identified, using computer analysis, 1,140 claims totaling $72,311
  that were potentially paid after the date of death.&nbsp; Subsequently, we
  requested the state review these claims and determine if they were unallowable.&nbsp; After
  reviewing the claims, the state confirmed that $16,229 (federal share $9,901)
  involving 141 claims were unallowable.&nbsp; Also, the state referred six recipients
  with claims of $2,817 (federal share $1,722) to the state’s Surveillance and
  Utilization Review (SURS) Unit because false Social Security numbers were used
  to obtain eligibility for Medicaid.&nbsp; The SURS has indicated they will
  pursue all claims relating to these ineligible individuals.</p>
