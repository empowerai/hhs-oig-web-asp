<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments pursuant
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; We found that the State agency did not report 34 Medicaid provider overpayments
  on the quarterly CMS 64 reports pursuant to Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agency did not have
  sufficient policies and procedures in place to ensure all overpayments were reported pursuant to Federal
  regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the State agency delayed returning the Federal share of overpayments
  totaling $1,090,421.&nbsp; Of that amount, the State agency had not yet reported or returned to the
  Federal Government overpayments totaling $1,068,751 as of December 7, 2004.&nbsp; Additionally, the
  State agency did not reclaim $25,049 (Federal share) pursuant to Federal regulations. </p>
<p>We recommended the State agency should (1) return to the Federal Government $1,093,800 of overpayments
  as soon as possible and (2) strengthen policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported
  pursuant to Federal regulations.&nbsp; Although the State agency agreed with some of our findings and
  recommendations, it disagreed with certain aspects of our findings and recommendations. </p>
