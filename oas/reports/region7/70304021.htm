<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides for a lower payment for home health services
  rendered to beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital within 14 days immediately preceding admission to home
  health care.&nbsp; Based on a statistically valid sample, we estimate overpayments of approximately $5.6 million to home
  health agencies (HHAs) were made by Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators (Cahaba) for fiscal year 2001 for claims that
  did not meet this 14-day requirement.&nbsp; These overpayments occurred because HHAs did not provide the necessary or correct
  information to Cahaba, and Cahaba had not established adequate postpayment controls to detect HHA claims that were billed
  incorrectly.&nbsp; In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended that Cahaba provide education to HHAs to ensure
  that beneficiary discharge data is completed accurately on patient assessment instruments.</p>
