<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Wyoming’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that the State had implemented the recommendations from our 
prior audit relating to the maintenance of an adequate subsidiary accounts 
receivable system and had developed policies and procedures for the tracking, 
billing and accounting for $0 unit rebate amounts.&nbsp; Manufacturers may make their 
outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering into a rebate 
agreement with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and paying 
quarterly rebates to the States. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, the State continued to inaccurately report drug 
rebate activity on the Form CMS-64.9R. &nbsp;Additionally, the State did not 
implement recommendations related to various accounting and dispute resolution 
procedures.&nbsp; Finally, the State did not establish controls over and 
accountability for collecting rebates on single-source drugs administered by 
physicians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State work with its contractor and 
CMS to determine how to correct the inaccuracies that were reported on the Form 
CMS-64.9R.&nbsp; We also continued to recommend that the State improve its accounting 
and dispute resolution procedures and develop a system for the collection of 
drug rebates on single-source drugs administered by physicians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In written comments on our draft report, the State agency 
generally concurred with our findings and recommendations and outlined its 
proposed corrective actions.</p>
