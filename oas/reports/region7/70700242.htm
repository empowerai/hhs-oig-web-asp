<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Regence Group (Regence), a Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) contractor,<a name="tm_805306447"> </a>did not comply 
with the Medicare contract’s pension segmentation requirements while updating 
the Medicare segments’ assets from January 1, 1997, to January 1, 2006. &nbsp;As a 
result, Regence overstated the Oregon Medicare segment assets by $1.75 million 
and understated the Utah Medicare segment assets by $28,000. &nbsp;Regence 
administered both Medicare Part A and Part B operations under cost reimbursement 
contracts with CMS until the contractual relationship was terminated November 
30, 2005.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, the Cost Accounting Standards require a 
segment closing adjustment to recognize Medicare’s share of the excess pension 
liabilities as a result of the termination of a Medicare contract.&nbsp; Regence did 
not calculate Medicare’s share of the excess pension liabilities. &nbsp;We calculated 
Medicare’s share of the excess pension to be $1.74 million ($1.02 million for 
Oregon and $722,000 for Utah). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Regence (1) decrease the Oregon 
Medicare segment pension assets by $1,749,136 and increase the Utah Medicare 
segment pension assets by $28,000 as of January 1, 2006, and (2) recognize $1.74 
million as Medicare’s share of the excess pension liabilities attributable to 
the segment closing calculation.&nbsp; Regence concurred with our audit results but 
took exception to the value of the participant liabilities used in the 
calculation of the segment closing.&nbsp; Regence also stated that the Oregon 
Medicare Data Center was not included in the segment closing and that it would 
submit a separate claim to CMS for those costs. &nbsp;After reviewing Regence’s 
comments, we continue to support our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; </p>
