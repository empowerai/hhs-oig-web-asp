<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming (Wyoming), a Centers for 
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) contractor, did not always comply with 
Federal requirements and the Medicare contracts’ pension segmentation 
requirements while updating the Medicare segments’ assets from the initial asset 
allocation to January 1, 2007.&nbsp; In addition, Wyoming did not comply with the 
provisions of its Medicare contracts or the Cost Accounting Standards when 
determining Medicare’s share of the Medicare segment excess pension assets as of 
the termination of the Medicare contracts. As a result, Wyoming overstated 
Medicare’s share by $47,000. &nbsp;Wyoming
<span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">administered Medicare Part A 
operations under cost reimbursement contracts with CMS until the contractual 
relationship was terminated October 31, 2006.&nbsp; The effective closing date for 
the Medicare segment was January 1, 2007.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Wyoming (1) decrease Medicare segment 
pension assets as of January 1, 2007, by $48,000; (2) decrease Medicare’s share 
of the excess Medicare segment pension assets as of January 1, 2007, by $48,000; 
and (3) refund to the Federal Government $70,000, which we calculated to be 
Medicare’s share of the Medicare segment excess pension assets as of the 
termination of the Medicare contracts.&nbsp; Wyoming concurred with our findings and 
stated that it will refund $70,000 to the Federal Government.</p>
