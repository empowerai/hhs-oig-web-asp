<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The purpose of this review was to determine the allowability of claims by
  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (Massachusetts) to Medicare for reimbursement
  of lump sum benefit payments made from the Pension Protection Plan (PPP) for
  the years 1987 through 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; We determined that Massachusetts over
  claimed allowable lump sum benefit payments made from its PPP for the years
  1987 through 1997.&nbsp; During this period, the allowable lump sum payments
  were $1,204,959.&nbsp; However, Massachusetts claimed PPP lump sum payments
  of $1,649,372 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, Massachusetts
  over claimed allowable PPP lump sum payments by $444,413.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Massachusetts revise its claim for benefit payments made from its PPP
  to eliminate the unallowable benefit payments of $444,413.&nbsp; Massachusetts
  agreed with our finding in total.</p>
