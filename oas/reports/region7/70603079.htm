<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The State did not assure that its $61,371,523 
($36,943,979 Federal share) Medicaid claim for the Child Welfare Services 
program was equal to or less than the limit specified in the State plan.&nbsp; 
Without such assurance—supported with auditable documentation—we were unable to 
express an opinion on the reasonableness of the claim. &nbsp;The State’s 
inadequate policies and procedures were the causes of its inability to provide 
such assurance.&nbsp; The <span style="font-weight: normal">State had contracted 
with providers for child welfare services and paid providers on a per child 
basis.&nbsp; We conducted this audit at CMS's request.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) work with CMS to determine the allowability of the $61,371,523 ($36,943,979 Federal share) for the audit period 
of State FYs 2001 through 2003 and all subsequent periods and (2) strengthen 
policies and procedures to ensure that State plan requirements are followed in 
submitting future child welfare services claims.&nbsp; The State agency concurred 
with our first recommendation and did not directly address our second 
recommendation.</span></p>
