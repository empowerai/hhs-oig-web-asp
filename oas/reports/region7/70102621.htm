<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Mutual had adequate controls
  to ensure PIP providers had not received dual payments.&nbsp; Dual payments occur
  when a provider receives PIP and claims payments from the Medicare program for
  the same services, resulting in an overpayment to the provider. &nbsp;We found
  that the quarterly procedures to detect dual payments were adequate.&nbsp; However,
  we did not always find evidence that Mutual's auditors had performed the dual payment
  detection procedure.&nbsp; We recommended that Mutual follow their procedures to
  detect dual payments and complete the dual payment verification worksheet for all
  cost report settlements of PIP providers.&nbsp; Mutual acknowledges that the cost
  report settlement files did not consistently contain documentation which verified
  that the dual payment detection procedure was performed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dual payment
  verification worksheet has been added to Mutual's tentative settlement worksheet
  templates.&nbsp; Additionally, Mutual has incorporated the dual payment verification
  worksheet into the standardized interim payment worksheets.</span></p>
