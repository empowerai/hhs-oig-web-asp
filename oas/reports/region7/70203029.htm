<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The purpose of this review was to determine the allowability of pension costs 
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement for Fiscal Years (FYs) 1992 through 2000.&nbsp; 
  For FYs 1992 through 2000, we determined that Wellmark, Inc. (Wellmark) over 
  claimed Medicare pension costs.&nbsp; During this period, the allowable Medicare 
  pension costs were $2,726,878.&nbsp; However, Wellmark claimed pension costs 
  of $3,273,931 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, Wellmark over claimed 
  pension costs by $547,053.&nbsp; This over claim of pension costs was the result 
  of Wellmark not basing their pension claims on separately calculated pension 
  costs for the Medicare segment.&nbsp; We recommended that Wellmark remit $547,053 
  to the Federal Government.</p>
