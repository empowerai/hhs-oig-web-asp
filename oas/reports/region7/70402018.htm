<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objectives of this review were this determine whether:&nbsp; (1) Montana was monitoring nursing homes to ensure compliance
  with institutions for mental disease (IMD) criteria; and (2) nursing homes participating in the Montana Medicaid program
  were IMDs.&nbsp; We reviewed nursing homes participating in the Medicaid program during Federal fiscal year 2003.&nbsp; Montana
  needs to establish specific controls to monitor nursing homes for compliance with IMD criteria.&nbsp; We also recommended
  that Montana monitor and evaluate, with qualified medical personnel, two nursing homes that may be IMDs. &nbsp;Montana
  responded that it did have several controls in place to assist in monitoring for compliance, and provided further analysis
  to show that the nursing homes identified in our report are not IMDs.&nbsp; They also agreed to institute procedures to
  routinely monitor for compliance with IMD criteria.</p>
