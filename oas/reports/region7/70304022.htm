<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Mariner Health of Denver (Mariner) was in compliance with Federal
  and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing facilities.&nbsp; Mariner is a 117 bed nursing facility located in
  Denver, Colorado.&nbsp; Mariner complied with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations with one exception.&nbsp; Colorado
  regulations require facilities to provide annual in-service education for staff in certain critical areas including rehabilitation.&nbsp; However,
  even though Mariner’s corporate office had developed a training seminar for rehabilitative services, the facility did not
  provide its nursing staff with rehabilitative nursing training on an annual basis.&nbsp; We recommended that Mariner review
  its annual in-service training program to assure that all mandated State required training is included for all staff.</p>
