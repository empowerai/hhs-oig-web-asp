<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, Finance and Support&rsquo;s (the State agency) claims for reimbursement of Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures complied with Federal requirements.&nbsp;We found that not all of the State agency&rsquo;s claims for reimbursement of Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures complied with Federal requirements.&nbsp;Specifically, for Federal fiscal years (FYs) 1998 through 2004, the State agency claimed duplicate expenditures for some outpatient drugs and for FYs 2003 and 2004, the State agency claimed unallowable expenditures ($266,752 Federal share) for drugs that were terminated, less than effective, or inadequately supported.&nbsp;The State agency also claimed expenditures ($608,624 Federal share) for drug products that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency: (1) refund $562,101 to the Federal Government for duplicate reported expenditures and drug expenditures that were not eligible for Medicaid coverage; (2) work with CMS to resolve $608,624 in payments for drugs that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have been eligible for Medicaid coverage; and (3) strengthen internal controls to ensure that claimed Medicaid drug expenditures comply with Federal requirements.&nbsp;The State agency concurred with our recommendations and provided comments on our characterization of two findings.</p>
