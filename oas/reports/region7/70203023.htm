<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objective of this review was to determine whether the amounts claimed
  by the State of Iowa for the Rehabilitative Treatment Services Family-Centered
  Program met Medicaid reimbursement requirements in Federal fiscal year (FFY)
  2001. Fifty-one of the 100 claims in our sample were unallowable because they
  were not in compliance with applicable criteria, including the Iowa State plan
  and the Iowa Administrative Code.&nbsp; Of the 51 unallowable claims, 26 contained
  more than 1 deficiency.&nbsp; The unallowable claims occurred because the State
  lacked adequate internal controls over the Family-Centered Program to ensure
  proper delivery of services for Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result,
  during FFY 2001, we estimate that the State claimed unallowable Federal Medicaid
  funding totaling $2,536,187.&nbsp; We recommended that the State (1) refund
  $2,536,187 to the Federal Government, and (2) strengthen policies and procedures
  to ensure that Medicaid payments are based on services directed exclusively
  to the rehabilitative treatment needs of the child as defined in the Iowa State
  plan and are provided in compliance with State and Federal regulations.</p>
