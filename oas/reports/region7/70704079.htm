<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">The objective of our review 
was to determine whether the Kansas State agency made payments on behalf of 
beneficiaries who should not have been Medicaid-eligible due to their 
eligibility in Missouri.&nbsp; For the period of July 1, 2005, 
through June 30, 2006, we estimate that the State agency paid $113,887 ($68,970 
Federal share) on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been eligible due 
to their Medicaid eligibility in Missouri.&nbsp; We attribute the Medicaid 
payments made on behalf of beneficiaries who were not eligible in Kansas to the 
insufficient sharing of eligibility data between the State agency and Missouri’s 
Medicaid agency.&nbsp; </font></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">We recommend that the State agency work with the Missouri 
Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid eligibility information for use in 
(1) determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status and (2) reducing the 
amount of payments, estimated to be $113,887 ($68,970 Federal share), made on 
behalf of beneficiaries residing in Missouri.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with 
our recommendations.</font></span></h2>
