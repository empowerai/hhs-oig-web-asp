<h1>Audit (A-07-12-03174)</h1>

<h2>05-17-2012<br />
Most of Missouri's Medicaid Expenditures for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2009, Were Adequately Supported and Allowable</h2>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the majority of the Medicaid costs that the Missouri Department of Social Services (State agency) claimed in the five line items (as well as two waivers) that we reviewed, which totaled approximately $1.13 billion (approximately $800 million Federal share), was adequately supported by actual recorded expenditures.  However, the State agency claimed unallowable costs totaling $16,000 ($12,000 Federal share) for 89 claims that we identified as duplicate claims.  In addition, the State agency may have incorrectly claimed an additional $82,000 ($59,000 Federal share) for 2,784 claims that may have been duplicates; we are setting aside these claims for adjudication by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.</p>
