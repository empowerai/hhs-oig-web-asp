<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0pt">Our objectives were to 
determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented the recommendations made 
in our previous audit of the Missouri drug rebate program and (2) established 
controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by 
physicians.&nbsp; We found that the State agency had established controls over 
collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; 
However, the State agency had not covered all the weaknesses identified in our 
previous audit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) develop policies 
and procedures to reconcile the general ledger control account to the subsidiary 
ledgers/records and to the Form CMS-64.9R; (2) develop policies and procedures 
to identify the State agency’s dispute resolution process, including policies 
and procedures to offer a State hearing mechanism to manufacturers in order to 
settle disputes; and (3) determine the actual accounts receivable balance as of 
June 30, 2006, and amend the Form CMS-64.9R to include all outstanding rebate 
balances.&nbsp; The State agency generally agreed with our findings and 
recommendations.</p>
