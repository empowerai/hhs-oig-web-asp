<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Pension Costs claimed 
  for Medicare Reimbursement by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska (Nebraska). 
  We determined that Nebraska claimed pension costs for 1987 through 1994 that 
  are unallowable for Medicare reimbursement. During this period, the allowable 
  Medicare pension costs were $73,844. However, Nebraska claimed pension costs 
  of $79,919 for Medicare reimbursement. As a result, Nebraska claimed $6,075 
  in pension costs that were unallowable. The over claim occurred primarily because 
  Nebraska did not base its claim on separately computed cost accounting Standards 
  (CAS) pension costs for the Medicare segment. We recommended Nebraska revise 
  its Final Administrative Cost Proposals to eliminate the unallowable pension 
  costs. We also recommended that Nebraska base future claims for Pension costs 
  on separately compound CAS costs for the Medicare segment. Nebraska accepted 
  our recommendation. </p>
