<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> Our objectives were to determine if South Carolina: &nbsp;(1) implemented our prior audit recommendation, and (2) complied
  with the Medicare contracts’ pension segmentation requirements while updating the Palmetto and TrailBlazer Medicare segment
  assets from January 1, 1993, to January 1, 2002.&nbsp; We found that South Carolina implemented our prior audit recommendation
  to increase Medicare segment assets by $394,005.&nbsp; However, South Carolina did not comply with the Medicare contracts’ pension
  segmentation requirements while updating the Palmetto and TrailBlazer Medicare segment pension assets.&nbsp; South Carolina
  understated Palmetto’s Medicare segment assets by $1,106,482 and overstated TrailBlazer’s Medicare segment assets by $345,006.&nbsp; South
  Carolina did not have adequate controls to ensure that its Medicare segments were identified in accordance with the Medicare
  contracts and that segment assets were updated in accordance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) 412 and 413.&nbsp; We
  recommend that South Carolina: &nbsp;(1) increase Palmetto’s Medicare segment pension assets by $1,106,482 as of January
  1, 2002, (2) decrease TrailBlazer’s Medicare segment pension assets by $345,006 as of January 1, 2002, and (3) implement
  controls to ensure that Medicare segments are identified in accordance with the Medicare contracts and updated in accordance
  with CAS 412 and 413.&nbsp; South Carolina agreed with the findings and recommendations.&nbsp; However, they requested
  an explanation of the allocation of interest on accumulated prepayment credits and additional input on the determination
of those areas that should be included in the Medicare segment.</p>
