<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had (1) resolved all audit recommendations as of December 31, 2005, and (2) resolved audit recommendations in a timely manner during calendar years (CY) 2003&ndash;2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2005, FDA had not resolved eight audit recommendations, all of which were past due for resolution. Additionally, during CYs 2003&ndash;2005, FDA resolved 306 of the 314 audit recommendations, but it did not resolve 287 of these recommendations within the required 6-month period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that FDA (1) resolve the outstanding audit recommendations and (2) resolve all audit recommendations within 6 months of receiving the audit reports as required. FDA concurred with all findings.</p>
