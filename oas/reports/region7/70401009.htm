<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was this determine whether Colorado claimed consultant fees, related to identifying family
  planning costs for Medicaid managed care, in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; >Colorado did not claim
  payments made to a consultant in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; As a result, Colorado received $179,267
  that does not qualify for Federal Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; We recommended Colorado refund $179,267 to the Federal
  government, and &nbsp;implement adequate controls to ensure all claims for Medicaid reimbursement involving payments made
  to consultants are submitted in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; Colorado agreed with our findings and
  recommendations.</p>
