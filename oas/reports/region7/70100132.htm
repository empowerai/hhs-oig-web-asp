<p> <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> <br />
  <br />
  Independence Blue Cross (IBC) was a Medicare contractor until their contract was
  terminated in 1997 and, as such, was allowed to claim Medicare reimbursement for
  their Medicare employees' pension costs.&nbsp; Regulations and the Medicare contracts
  provide, however, that pension gains, which occur when a Medicare segment of a
  pension plan closes, should be credited to the Medicare program.&nbsp; We identified
  about $2.9 million in excess pension assets at IBC.&nbsp; Accordingly, we are recommending
  that IBC remit the $2.9 million in excess pension assets to the Medicare program.</p>
