<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report addresses the allowability of retroactive quarterly claims totaling 
  $12,236,529 in Federal financial participation (FFP) resubmitted by the Missouri 
  Department of Social Services (State) for reimbursement under the title IV-E 
  Foster Care Program. It was determined that $7,990,234 (FFP) resubmitted for 
  Federal reimbursement was allowable for the calendar year 1989. The State's 
  resubmitted Title IV-E retroactive claims, however, included $4,109,375 (FFP) 
  which were outside the 2-year regulatory deadline for filing claims and therefore 
  unallowable. We recommended a financial adjustment of $954,927 for the first 
  quarter, and set aside for ACF resolution $3,154,448 for the other three quarters.
