<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>

<p>Our objective was to determine whether Blackfeet Community 
Hospital located in Browning, Montana had completed the credentialing, 
privileging, and personnel suitability reviews for its medical practitioners.&nbsp; 
For more than half of the practitioners tested, we found that the hospital did 
not perform a complete credentialing review or initiate the required personnel 
suitability review.&nbsp; The hospital did not verify the credentials of 55 percent 
of the sampled practitioners before they provided patient care, did not issue 
current privileges for six percent, and did not have information indicating 
that it had requested background investigations from the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) for 52 percent of practitioners.</p>
<p>We recommended that IHS direct Blackfeet Community Hospital to: (1) take action 
necessary to ensure the credentialing and privileging reviews are completed in a 
timely manner, and (2) initiate the required OPM background investigations for 
its practitioners.&nbsp; In written comments, IHS stated that all recommended 
corrected actions had been taken.</p>
