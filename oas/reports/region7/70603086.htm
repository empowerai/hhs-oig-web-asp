<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the Missouri 
Department of Social Services (the State) correctly determined State-owned 
Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) to be eligible for Medicaid 
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for Federal fiscal years (FFY) 
2003–2005.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The State correctly determined seven State-owned IMDs to be 
DSH eligible for FFYs 2003–2005.&nbsp; However, the State incorrectly computed the 
Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rates (MIUR) for the IMDs because it did not 
comply with Federal regulations concerning the exclusion of inpatient days 
related to unallowable age groups and incarcerated individuals.&nbsp; In addition, 
the State included unallowable inpatient days related to accounting errors for 
the FFY 2003–2005 DSH eligibility determination.&nbsp; The State also lacked 
adequate controls concerning the acquisition, review and maintenance of 
contemporaneous documentation to support the MIUR calculations.&nbsp; As a result, 
the State could not adequately support its MIUR calculations for State-owned 
IMDs.&nbsp; These errors did not cause the MIUR to fall below the 1-percent 
threshold at any of these State-owned IMDs.&nbsp; However, we are concerned that 
the State may in the future overstate the MIURs and, consequently, incorrectly 
classify one or more IMDs as DSH eligible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommend that the State (1) comply with Federal regulations 
concerning the exclusion of unallowable inpatient days from the MIUR 
calculations; and (2) strengthen controls to eliminate accounting error<a name="tm_671088709">s</a> 
and to acquire, review, and maintain contemporaneous documentation to support 
the original Medicaid DSH MIUR calculations. &nbsp;The State neither agreed nor 
disagreed with our first recommendation and agreed with our second 
recommendation.</p>
