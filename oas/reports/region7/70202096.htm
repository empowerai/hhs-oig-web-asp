<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our limited
    review of medical education payments made to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St.
    Louis, Missouri under the Medicare program.&nbsp; The purpose of the review
    was to determine the accuracy of intern and resident full-time equivalents
    (FTEs) used by Barnes-Jewish Hospital (the Hospital) for claiming direct
    graduate medical education and indirect graduate medical education costs.&nbsp; The
    review covered FTEs claimed for the Hospital’s fiscal year ended December
    31, 1998, for which the hospital claimed costs of $53,112,612.&nbsp; Our
    review did not show a need to revise the FTE counts or change control procedures
    for developing the counts.&nbsp; Therefore, we have no recommendations for
  the Hospital to address.</p>
