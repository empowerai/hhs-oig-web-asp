<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if capitalization payments to
  Coventry were appropriate for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during
  the audit period.&nbsp; Medicare generally pays a higher monthly capitation
  rate for enrolled beneficiaries who are residents of a Medicare or Medicaid
  certified institution (or the distinct part of the institution).&nbsp; We determined
  that Coventry received Medicare overpayments totaling $132,000 for 61 beneficiaries
  incorrectly classified as institutionalized during the audit period.&nbsp; Of
  these, a total of 37 beneficiaries were incorrectly classified because they
  were residing in assisted living facilities (19); or were residing in non-approved
  facilities (7); or had not met the 30 consecutive day minimum time requirement
  to qualify as institutionalized (11).&nbsp; In addition, Coventry incorrectly
  classified 24 beneficiaries as institutional who were residing in the non-certified
  portion of the institution.&nbsp; We recommend that Coventry refund overpayments
  of approximately $132,000, ensure adherence to policies and procedures for
  verifying institutional care, and develop more effective internal control procedures
  for verification of each beneficiary's institutional status.</p>
