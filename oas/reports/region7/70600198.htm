<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to: &nbsp;(1) determine if pension costs for plan years 1986 through
  1997 were funded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the Cost Accounting
  Standards and (2) identify and properly account for any accumulated unfunded pension costs,
  including unallowable and reassignable portions.&nbsp; We found that Utah did not properly
  fund the pension costs allocable to the Medicare contracts for plan years 1993 and 1995.&nbsp; In
  addition, Utah did not identify or properly account for accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; As
  a result, Utah understated the January 1, 1998, accumulated unallowable pension costs by
  $202,066 ($174,774 for the Other segment plus $27,292 for the Medicare segment).&nbsp; We
  recommended that Utah identify accumulated unallowable pension costs of $202,066 ($174,774
  for the Other segment plus $27,292 for the Medicare segment) as of January 1, 1998.&nbsp; Utah
  concurred with our recommendation.</p>
