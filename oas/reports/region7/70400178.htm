<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objectives of our review were to (1) determine if the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our prior
  review were accounted for properly; (2) determine if pension costs for plan years 1994-2001 were funded in accordance with
  the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS); and (3) identify and properly account
  for any additional accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; We found that South Carolina properly accounted for the accumulated
  unfunded pension costs identified in our prior review.&nbsp; Additionally, South Carolina funded the pension costs for
  plan years 1994-2001 in accordance with the FAR and the CAS.&nbsp; However, South Carolina did not correctly identify or
  properly account for the additional accumulated unfunded pension costs due to a lack of adequate policies and procedures.&nbsp; The
  accumulated unfunded pension costs consist of the accumulated unallowable pension costs and the accumulated reassignable
  pension costs.&nbsp; South Carolina correctly identified and properly accounted for the accumulated unallowable pension
  costs.&nbsp; We recommended South Carolina should (1) decrease the accumulated reassignable pension costs of the Medicare
  segment by $467,768 as of January 1, 2002; (2) identify the accumulated reassignable pension costs of the Other segment
  as $3,471,124 as of January 1, 2002; and (3) establish procedures to annually update the reassignable pension costs for
  the Medicare and Other segments.&nbsp; South Carolina agreed with our draft report findings and recommendations, and stated
  it would implement our recommendations.</p>
