<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company (TOLIC) was a Medicare contractor 
  until its contract was terminated in 2000 and, as such, was allowed to claim 
  Medicare reimbursement for its Medicare employees' post retirement benefit (PRB) 
  costs.&nbsp; However, regulations provide that, to be allowable, PRB costs must 
  be funded by the time set for filing for Federal income tax return or any extension 
  thereof.&nbsp; The PRB costs assigned to the current year, but not funded by 
  the tax return time, are not allowable in any subsequent year.&nbsp; Since TOLIC's 
  claims was based on unfunded costs, we recommended that TOLIC withdraw its claim 
  of approximately $3.1 million for PRB costs.</p>
