<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Pension Costs Claimed 
  for Medicare Reimbursement by Rocky Mountain Health Care Corporation (Colorado) 
  for Fiscal Years 1988 through 1995. In 1989 Colorado, Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
  of New Mexico (New Mexico), and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nevada (Nevada) 
  merged into the Rocky Mountain Health Care Corporation (Rocky Mountain). Our 
  review included pension costs claimed by Colorado prior to the merger. For clarity, 
  we used the current name of Rocky Mountain in this report for referring to Colorado 
  prior to 1989. We reviewed pension costs claimed by New Mexico prior to the 
  merger, in a separate audit (CIN: A-07-96-01196). Nevada was not a medicare 
  contractor. </p>
<p>We determined that Rocky Mountain underclaimed allowable Medicare pension costs 
  for 1988 through 1995. During this period, the allowable Medicare pension costs 
  were $783,497. However, Rocky Mountain claimed pension costs of $708,324 for 
  Medicare reimbursement. As a result, Rocky Mountain did not claim $75,173 of 
  allowable pension costs. The underclaim occurred primarily because Rocky Mountain 
  did not base its claim on separately computed Cost Accounting Standards pension 
  costs for the Medicare segment. We recommended Rocky Mountain revise its Final 
  Administrative Cost Proposals to reflect the remaining allowable pension costs.
