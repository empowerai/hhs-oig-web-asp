<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Grant No. 07-CY-0485, a discretionary
  grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &#150; Administration
  for Children and Families (ACF).&nbsp; Youth Emergency Service (YES) received a
  basic center grant totaling $519,000 to administer a program for runaway and homeless
  youth.&nbsp; The grant period was September 1, 1997 through August 31, 2000.&nbsp; Our
  objectives were to assess the achievement of the grant objectives and to determine
  compliance with grant terms and conditions.&nbsp; We found that YES was able to
  materially accomplish the grant objectives.&nbsp; However, they did not fully comply
  with the grant&#146;s terms and conditions.&nbsp; Progress reports were not filed
  promptly according to instructions issued by ACF officials.&nbsp; YES did not comment
  on our conclusion and recommendation.</p>
