<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Our objective was to determine whether the 
State agency claimed allowable Medicaid payments for family preservation 
services during State fiscal years (FY) 2001 through 2003 (July 1, 2000–June 30, 
2003) in accordance with expenditure limitations contained in the State plan.
<br>
<br>
The State agency did not assure that its $3,376,139 ($2,030,607 Federal share) 
claim was equal to or less than the limit specified in the State plan.&nbsp; 
Without such assurance—supported with auditable documentation—we are unable to 
express an opinion on the reasonableness of the State agency’s claim for 
reimbursement on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Quarterly 
Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program (CMS-64) 
reports.&nbsp; The State agency’s lack of internal controls was the cause of its 
inability to provide such assurance. <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency work with CMS to determine the allowability 
of the $3,376,139 ($2,030,607 Federal share) for the audit period of State FYs 
2001 through 2003.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with our recommendation.</span></h1>
