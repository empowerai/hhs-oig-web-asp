<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The final audit of administrative costs totaling $58,837,734 determined that 
  $4,244,570 was unallowable. Blue Cross Blue Shield claimed $4,244,570 in excess 
  of approved budgets, of which $258,534 was also questioned for other reasons. 
  This $258,534 was made up of excess executive compensation $141,554 and unallowable 
  cafeteria costs $116,980. We are recommending the final administrative cost 
  proposal be reduced by a total of $4,244,570. </p>
