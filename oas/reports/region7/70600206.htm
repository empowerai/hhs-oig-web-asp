<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Arkansas complied with the Medicare contract&rsquo;s pension segmentation requirements while:&nbsp;(1) implementing the prior audit finding; (2) updating Medicare segment assets from January 1, 1996, to May 1, 1999; and (3) determining the excess assets that should be remitted to Medicare as a result of the termination of its defined benefit pension plan.&nbsp;Arkansas properly implemented the prior audit recommendation; however, it did not comply with the Medicare contract&rsquo;s pension segmentation requirements while updating the Medicare segment&rsquo;s assets from January 1, 1996, to May 1, 1999.&nbsp;As a result, Arkansas overstated the Medicare segment assets by $546,859.&nbsp;In addition, Arkansas did not comply with the cost accounting standards in determining Medicare&rsquo;s share of the excess pension assets as of May 1, 1999.&nbsp;Arkansas calculated and remitted to the Federal Government $1,125,543 as Medicare&rsquo;s share of the excess pension assets, which is a $16,711 overstatement.</p>
<p>We recommended that Arkansas decrease Medicare&rsquo;s share of the excess pension assets by $16,711, and adjust its Final Administrative Cost Proposal to properly reflect Medicare&rsquo;s share of the excess assets. Arkansas generally disagreed.</p>
