<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">For fiscal years 2003 
and 2004, Missouri claimed $2.9 million in Medicaid reimbursement for 
prescription drugs that were no longer eligible for reimbursement or 
inadequately documented. The </span>Medicaid drug rebate program generally pays 
for covered outpatient drugs if their manufacturers have rebate agreements with 
Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and pay rebates to the States.&nbsp; 
Under the drug rebate program, CMS provides the States with a quarterly Medicaid 
drug tape, which the States use to verify coverage of the drugs for which they 
claim reimbursement.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
An additional $1.9 million <span style="layout-grid-mode: line">represented 
expenditures for drug products that were</span> not listed on the quarterly drug 
tapes.&nbsp; Because the State did not verify whether these drugs were eligible for 
coverage, these expenditures may not have been allowable.&nbsp; We identified no 
other errors for the remainder of the $2.09 billion ($1.33&nbsp;billion Federal 
share) that the State claimed.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) refund $2.9 million to the Federal Government
<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">for drug expenditures that were not 
eligible for Medicaid coverage, (2) work with CMS to resolve </span>$1.9 million
<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">in payments for drugs that were not listed 
on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have been eligible for Medicaid 
coverage, and (3) </span>strengthen internal controls to ensure that claimed 
Medicaid drug expenditures comply with Federal requirements. &nbsp;The State 
disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
