<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of our analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness 
  of TrailBlazer Health Enterprises' claims processing system in identifying payment 
  reductions for multiple ambulatory surgical center procedures for calendar years 
  1999 through 2001.&nbsp; Regulations require that when multiple services are 
  provided in the same operative session, the highest paying procedure is reimbursable 
  at the full payment rate while the other procedures are reimbursable at one-half 
  the normal payment rate.&nbsp; Our analysis showed that TrailBlazer Health Enterprises’ 
  systems failed to identify such instances, which resulted in provider overpayments 
  for calendar years 1999 through 2001of approximately $79,164, $51,665 and&nbsp; 
  $45,215 ($176,044), respectively.&nbsp; Included in the identified overpayments 
  is approximately $35,842 in beneficiary overpayments for coinsurance.&nbsp; 
  Most of the overpayments occurred because the carrier’s processing system did 
  not identify multiple procedures performed during the same session when submitted 
  on separate claims.</p>
