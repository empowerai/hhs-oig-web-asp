<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides
    the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audit Services
    (OAS) review titled, &quot;Medicare Cost Reporting Integrity for Cost Plan
    H6161 for the Period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998.&quot;&nbsp; The
    purpose of our review was to evaluate costs claimed for reasonableness, allowability
    and allocability, and to test paid claims data for duplicate claims.&nbsp; We
    found the cost reporting process to be generally adequate and that the Medical
    Associates Health Plans (MAHP) was detecting and adjusting most duplicate
    payments.&nbsp; There were, however, a small number of claims (totaling $1,006),
    which were paid by both MAHP and the carriers.&nbsp; We recommended that
    MAHP revise the 1998 cost report to eliminate the duplicate payments and
  continue to closely monitor duplicate claims.</p>
