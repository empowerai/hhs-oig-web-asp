<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Medicaid regulations allow States to establish payment methodologies that provide for enhanced payments (in addition to the regular Medicaid payments) to non-State-owned government providers, such as city and county-owned nursing facilities.&nbsp; This final report points out Nebraska did not determine such payments correctly for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; The approved State plan required such payments be computed based on the difference between allowable Medicare payment rates and actual Medicaid payment rates to nursing facilities.&nbsp; The allowable Medicare payment rate for each facility was to include a wage index factor.&nbsp; Because the State did not use the wage index factor in their calculations of the allowable Medicare payment rates, the State claims were overstated by about $44 million (Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that Nebraska refund the $44 million, and use the wage index factor in the calculation of future enhanced payments.</p>
