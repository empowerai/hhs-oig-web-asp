<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Mutual, 
  at cost report settlement, had correctly calculated providers’ disproportionate 
  share hospital (DSH) payments.&nbsp; We found that Mutual incorrectly calculated 
  DSH payments for two of 45 providers we reviewed, and made other minor settlement 
  errors for one of the two providers with a DSH payment error.&nbsp; Consequently, 
  Mutual made a net Medicare underpayment of $2,345.&nbsp; These payment problems 
  occurred because of insufficient supervisory review of cost report settlements.&nbsp; 
  We brought this to Mutual’s attention.&nbsp; They indicated the cost reports 
  would be reopened and adjusted.&nbsp; We 
  recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS):&nbsp; 
  (i) monitor Mutual’s reopening of the cost reports for the two providers with 
  settlement errors identified in our review; and, (ii) ensure that Mutual establishes 
  sufficient supervisory review procedures for cost report settlements.</p>
