<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This review was made to determine whether grants totaling $8.2 million provided 
  relief to flood victims in accordance with guidelines established by a Midwest 
  Flood Health and Medical Task Force. Our final report points out that awards 
  totaling $4.2 million were not granted for purposes consistent with Task Force 
  guidelines. Two grantees whose clinics were undamaged by the flood received 
  funds for new construction and acquisition of facilities that would not be operational 
  until years after the disaster. One grantee received funds to provide primary 
  health care services, however, no services were provided for nearly one year 
  after the grant award was made. We recommended that the Health Resources and 
  Services Administration (HRSA) review the justification used to fund these awards, 
  and if the justification is not consistent with legislative intent of the emergency 
  appropriation, other appropriate funding should be sought for these projects 
  and the flood funds returned to the Treasury. We also recommended that HRSA 
  develop procedures for objectively evaluating applications against established 
  criteria. The HRSA generally concurred with our recommendations. </p>
