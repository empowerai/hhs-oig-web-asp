<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objectives of our review were to (1) determine whether 
the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our prior review 
(A-07-94-00778) of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia (Georgia) were accounted 
for properly; (2) determine whether pension costs for plan years 1994 through 
2000 were funded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and 
Cost Accounting Standards (CAS); and (3) identify and properly account for any 
additional accumulated unfunded pension costs, including the identification of 
the allowable and reassignable portions of the accumulated unfunded pension 
costs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Georgia did not properly account for all of the accumulated 
unfunded pension costs identified in our prior review. &nbsp;For the current audit 
period (1994 through 2000), pension costs were funded in accordance with FAR and 
CAS in all years except plan year 1999. &nbsp;As a result, Georgia understated 
accumulated unallowable unfunded pension costs by $1,201,461 ($88,452 for the 
Medicare segment plus $1,113,009 for the Other segment) as of January 1, 2001.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Georgia (1) identify $1,201,461 of 
accumulated unallowable unfunded pension costs ($88,452 as an unallowable 
component of Medicare segment pension costs and $1,113,009 as an unallowable 
component of the Other segment pension costs) as of January 1, 2001; and (2) 
properly identify, and update with interest, unallowable unfunded pension costs 
in subsequent years. &nbsp;Georgia concurred with our recommendations.</p>
