<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Poplar Grove Care Center (Poplar Grove) was in
  compliance with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing facilities.&nbsp; Poplar Grove is a 95 bed
  nursing facility located in Commerce City, Colorado.&nbsp; Poplar Grove complied with Federal and State staffing laws and
  regulations with one exception.&nbsp; State regulations require that a nursing care facility shall be staffed at all times
  with at least one registered nurse who is on duty on the premises.&nbsp; However, Poplar Grove did not always have a registered
  nurse on the premises during the evening shift.&nbsp; Poplar Grove officials indicated that it is difficult to employ a
  registered nurse during the evening shift.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of a registered nurse on the premises at all times may
  result in a reduction in the quality of care received by residents.&nbsp; We recommended that Poplar Grove make additional
  efforts, including expanding its hiring efforts, to ensure that the facility is staffed at all times with a registered
  nurse.</p>
