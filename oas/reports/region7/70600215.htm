<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine the allowability of excess benefit plan (EBP) costs claimed by CIGNA for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FYs) 1991 through 2004.&nbsp;We found that CIGNA claimed unallowable EBP costs for FYs 1991 through 2004.&nbsp;During this period, the allowable EBP costs were $213,630. However, CIGNA claimed EBP costs of $329,296 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp;CIGNA claimed $115,666 of unallowable EBP costs because it did not claim EBP costs in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that CIGNA revise its final administrative cost proposals for FYs 1991 through 2004 to reduce its claimed EBP costs by $115,666.&nbsp;We also recommend that CIGNA claim future EBP costs in accordance with the CAS.&nbsp;CIGNA concurred with our findings and stated that it will be working with CMS to settle the $115,666 owed.</p>
