<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of carriers’ 
  claims processing systems in identifying payment reductions for multiple ambulatory 
  surgical center procedures for calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; Regulations 
  require that when multiple services are provided in the same operative session, 
  the highest paying procedure is reimbursable at the full payment rate while 
  the other procedures are reimbursable at one-half the normal payment rate.&nbsp; 
  Our analysis showed that National Heritage Insurance Company of New England’s 
  systems failed to identify such instances, which resulted in provider overpayments 
  for calendar years 1997 through 2001 of approximately $1,196, $25,017, $48,619, 
  $37,604 and&nbsp; $50,074 ($162,510), respectively.&nbsp; Included in the identified 
  overpayments is approximately $32,762 in beneficiary overpayments for coinsurance.&nbsp; 
  Most of the overpayments occurred because the carrier’s processing system did 
  not identify multiple procedures performed during the same session when submitted 
  on separate claims.</p>
