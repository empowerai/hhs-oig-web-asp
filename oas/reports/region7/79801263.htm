<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that review of medical records performed by the 
  intermediary's medical review staff and the Health Care Financing Administration's 
  medical surveyors found that all of the 1,030 units of service included in 100 
  sampled claims made by the Mental Health Corporation of Denver (MHCD) did not 
  meet Medicare requirements for partial hospitalization services (PHP). Based 
  on the totality of the evidence, we have questioned the entire $4,447,607 charged 
  for PHP services by MHCD during Fiscal Year 1996. During the course of our audit, 
  MHCD discontinued billing Medicare for PHP services. In addition to a financial 
  adjustment, we are recommending that the intermediary (Blue Cross Blue Shield 
  of Texas) review PHP services provided by MHCD for other cost report periods. 
  We are also recommending that MHCD take the necessary steps to ensure that any 
  future billings for PHP services meet the Medicare requirements for such services.
