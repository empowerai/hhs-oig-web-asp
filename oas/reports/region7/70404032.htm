<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the 2003 revision of 
the Medicare outlier payment regulations reduced operating outlier payments for 
specific hospitals.&nbsp; The revised outlier payment regulations reduced collective 
operating outlier payments to 362 hospitals that had received high levels of 
such payments.&nbsp; For those hospitals, operating outlier payments decreased from 
9.1 percent of Medicare operating diagnosis-related group payments in December 
2002 to 5.2 percent in December 2003.&nbsp; Further outlier payment adjustments may 
occur when the fiscal intermediaries conduct final settlements of the hospitals’ 
cost reports.&nbsp; We recommended that CMS continue to monitor Medicare outlier 
payments to all prospective payment system hospitals to ensure that the payments 
comply with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; CMS concurred.</p>
