<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This audit was part of a multistate initiative.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether
  Kansas claimed costs for school-based health services provided by selected school districts
  for fiscal year 2002 in accordance with Federal requirements and the State plan.&nbsp; Kansas
  claims some costs that were not in accordance with Federal requirements and the State plan.&nbsp; Our
  review of 300 sampled claims showed that 217 claims were unallowable for Medicaid reimbursement,
  including 139 claims for services that were not rendered and 78 claims that did not have
  required prescriptions or referrals.&nbsp; In addition, many sampled claims lacked documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that Kansas (1) refund $5.1 million to the Federal Government, (2) calculate
  and refund the portion of $126.8 million (Federal share) paid to school districts outside
  of our sample that does not qualify for reimbursement, (3) provide correct instructions to
  schools, and (4) ensure that school districts maintain required documentation.&nbsp; Kansas
  did not agree with our recommendations to refund but did agree to provide correct instructions
  and ensure that schools maintain documentation.</p>
