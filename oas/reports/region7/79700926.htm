<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final audit report addressed the adequacy of procedures used by Missouri 
  for effectively maximizing available discount drug pricing programs. We compared 
  drug prices obtained from the Department of Health under the Ryan White Care 
  Act, Title II (Title II) and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program Programs (ADAP) 
  with drug prices obtained from the Department of Social Services under the Medicaid 
  program. The review covered drugs totaling $270,335 paid during the period April 
  1, 1996 through December 31, 1996. Generally, we found that drug prices under 
  Title II and ADAP were comparable to drug prices under Medicaid. No formal recommendations 
  were made at this time, however, because the programs are expanding, we believe 
  the State should continue to monitor drug prices to minimize future drug costs.
