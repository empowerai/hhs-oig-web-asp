<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to evaluate whether the Kansas Department
  of Social &amp; Rehabilitation Services (SRS) had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found
  that the SRS lacked sufficient internal controls with regard to the Medicaid
  drug rebate program as required by federal rules and regulations.&nbsp; Areas
  that lacked sufficient internal controls included:&nbsp; recording accounts
  receivable, reconciliation of form CMS 64.9R and the general ledger, interest
  accrual, interest reporting, and invoice verification.&nbsp; These issues occurred
  because the SRS did not develop or follow adequate policies and procedures
  with regard to the drug rebate program.&nbsp; Federal regulations require effective
  control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets.&nbsp; In
  addition, the rebate agreements between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
  Services (CMS) and the drug manufacturers require the payment of interest on
  all disputed, late, and unpaid drug rebates.&nbsp; Also, the State Medicaid
  Manual requires interest revenue to be reported on the Form CMS 64 Summary
  Sheet.&nbsp; Drug rebate receivables were perpetually understated and it is
  likely that the SRS did not receive all drug rebates and interest on disputed
  or late rebate payments due from manufacturers.&nbsp; In addition, the SRS
  did not have reasonable assurance that drug rebate balances and collections
  reported to CMS were accurate.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of sufficient internal
  controls increased the risk for fraud, waste, or abuse of drug rebate program
  funds.</p>
