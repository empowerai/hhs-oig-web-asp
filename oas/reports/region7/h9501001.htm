<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>In this final report, we determined that the Indian Health Services (IHS initially 
  provided cash to Klamath Tribal Health and Family Services (KTHFS) in excess 
  of actual cash expenditures, resulting in the accumulation of $316,651 of excess 
  cash held in certificates of deposit as of December 31, 1994. The KTHFS did 
  not subsequently reduce its cash requests to eliminate the excess. In addition, 
  the KTHFS also made excessive payments totaling $94,637 to its executive director 
  over a two-year period. </p>
