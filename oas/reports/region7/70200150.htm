<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if capitation payments to HealthAmerica
  Pennsylvania, Inc. (HealthAmerica), contract number H3959, were appropriate for
  beneficiaries reported as institutionalized for the audit period.&nbsp; We determined
  that HealthAmerica received Medicare overpayments totaling $26,000 for 15 beneficiaries
  incorrectly classified as institutionalized during the audit period.&nbsp; Some
  of the overpayments occurred because of the lack of oversight of internal control
  procedures.&nbsp; Other overpayments occurred due to the lack of procedures requiring
  managed care organizations to determine if the beneficiary resided in a certified
  distinct part of the institution.&nbsp; We recommended that HealthAmerica refund
  the overpayments, ensure adherence to policies and procedures for verifying institutional
  care, and develop more effective internal control procedures.</p>
