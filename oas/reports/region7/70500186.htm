<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of the postretirement benefit (PRB) costs Veritus
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement on an accrual basis.&nbsp; We found that Veritus did not include
  in its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACPs) all of the PRB costs that were allowable pursuant
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; As a result, for fiscal years (FYs) 1995 through 1997, Veritus did not
  claim $201,785 of PRB costs that were allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; In addition, Veritus
  did not receive CMS approval for its change in accounting methodology for PRB costs.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Veritus revise its FACPs for FYs 1995 through 1997 or submit a claim for additional allowable
  PRB costs of $201,785.&nbsp; After addressing the issues raised under Other Matters, Veritus should
  seek approval for its change in accounting practice.</p>
<p>Veritus agreed with our recommendation to revise its FACPs or submit a claim for additional allowable
  PRB costs of $201,785.&nbsp; Additionally, Veritus agreed that it did not seek CMS approval for its
  change in accounting methodology for PRB costs.&nbsp; However, Veritus disagreed with our statement
  in the Other Matters section that Veritus should be precluded from including unfunded PRB costs in
  any future claims to the Federal Government.&nbsp; Veritus believes that by requiring contractors to
  use FAS106 in calculating PRB costs, the&nbsp;Federal Acquisition Regulations&nbsp;irreconcilably conflict
  with the Internal Revenue Service limitations on&nbsp;Voluntary Employee Benefit Association&nbsp;funding.</p>
