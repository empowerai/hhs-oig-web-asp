<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Kansas claimed costs for Medicaid school-based health
  services consistent with the design of the bundled payment rates and pursuant to Federal
  regulations and the State plan.&nbsp; Kansas did not reimburse school districts consistent
  with the payment rates’ design or pursuant to Federal regulations or the State plan.&nbsp; Although
  Kansas designed the monthly payment rates to reimburse school districts for a full year’s
  costs over 9 school months, Kansas used these rates to reimburse the school districts for
  12 months.&nbsp; We recommended that Kansas refund $13.9 million to the Federal government
  and ensure that future claims for Medicaid reimbursement for school-based services are submitted
  pursuant to Federal regulations and the State plan.&nbsp; Kansas concurred.</p>
