<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State’s claims for adult
  rehabilitation services met Federal and State Medicaid reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Of the 100
  adult rehabilitation services claimed in our sample, 65 were unallowable because documentation was
  missing or inadequate, services were nonrehabilitative, a conflict of interest existed because the
  provider both authorized and rendered the services, and/or no services were provided or the beneficiaries
  were not present.&nbsp; These errors occurred because the State lacked adequate internal controls over
  the adult rehabilitation services program to ensure that services claimed for Medicaid reimbursement
  met applicable requirements.&nbsp; We estimated that $6,244,154 in Federal funds that the State claimed
  for Federal fiscal year 2002 was unallowable.&nbsp; We recommended that the State refund the $6,244,154
  to the Federal Government and strengthen policies and procedures to ensure that services claimed for
  Medicaid reimbursement are directed exclusively to the beneficiary’s rehabilitative needs and meet
  other Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; The State generally concurred, agreeing overall with 59
  of the 65 claims found in error.</p>
