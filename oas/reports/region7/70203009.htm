<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The purpose of this review 
  was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement 
  for Fiscal Years (FY's) 1988 through 1999.&nbsp; For 
  Fiscal Years 1988 through 1999, we determined that Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield 
  (Trigon) under claimed allowable Medicare pension costs.&nbsp; During this period, 
  the allowable Medicare pension costs were $2,677,690.&nbsp; However, Trigon 
  claimed pension costs of $1,379,473 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, 
  Trigon did not claim $1,298,217 in allowable pension costs.&nbsp; This under 
  claim of pension costs was the result of Trigon basing their pension cost calculations 
  on incorrect asset values, and because Trigon neglected to include certain pension 
  contribution amounts on their Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACPS). &nbsp;We 
  are recommending Trigon revise its FACPs to reflect the remaining allowable 
  pension costs.&nbsp; Trigon agreed with our recommendations.</p>
