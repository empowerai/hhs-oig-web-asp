<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The audit objective was to determine the allowability of PRB costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement
  by North Carolina for FY’s 1993 through 2002.&nbsp; For FY’s 1993 through 2002, North Carolina did not claim $616,846 of
  PRB costs that were allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; North Carolina should revise its FACPs for FY’s 1993 through
  2002 to claim additional allowable PRB costs.&nbsp; </p>
