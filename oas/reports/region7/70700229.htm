<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina (South Carolina) 
overclaimed TrailBlazer Health Enterprises’s (TrailBlazer) accrued 
postretirement benefit (PRB) costs on the final administrative cost proposals (FACP) 
for fiscal years (FY) 2000 through 2004.&nbsp; We determined that the allowable 
accrued PRB costs for this period were $2,355,247.&nbsp; However, South Carolina 
claimed accrued PRB costs of $4,045,529 on the FACPs because it did not compute 
PRB costs in accordance with its Medicare contract and an agreement with the 
Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.&nbsp; As a result, South Carolina 
overclaimed $1,690,282 in accrued PRB costs for FYs 2000 through 2004.<span style="font-weight: normal"><br>
<br>
We recommended that South Carolina revise TrailBlazer’s FACPs for FYs 2000 
through 2004 to reduce its claimed PRB costs by $1,690,282.&nbsp; We also recommended 
that South Carolina claim future PRB costs in accordance with the Medicare 
contract. &nbsp;South Carolina did not concur with our recommendations.</span></p>
