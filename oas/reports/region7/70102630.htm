<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p> This report provides the results of our review of Mutual of Omaha's (Mutual's)
  settlement procedures for provider-based home health agencies (HHAs).&nbsp;&nbsp; The
  objective of our review was to determine whether Mutual had adequate controls to
  settle HHA cost reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found that Mutual did not always settle
  HHA cost reports using reliable Provider Statistical and Reimbursement (PS&amp;R)
  data.&nbsp; Consequently, Mutual overpaid two HHA providers a total of $179,018
  because Mutual used incorrect PS&amp;R data. Additionally, Mutual found that periodic
  interim payments (PIP) were incorrectly determined at final settlement.&nbsp; Mutual
  revised PIP for the two providers, which increased the total overpayment to $316,949.</p>
