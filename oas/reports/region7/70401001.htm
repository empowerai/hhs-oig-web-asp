<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether Mercy Health Plans’ (Mercy) modifications to the contract year
  2001 Adjusted Community Rate Proposal (proposal), submitted under the Benefits Improvement Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000,
  were supported and whether additional capitation payments were used in a manner consistent with the BIPA requirements.&nbsp; Our
  review determined that Mercy adequately supported modifications to the calendar year 2001 proposal.&nbsp; The review also
  confirmed that Mercy utilized the increased payments in accordance with BIPA requirements and as stated in their proposals.&nbsp; The
  increased BIPA payments were in fact used to reduce beneficiary premiums and cost sharing, and for increased payments to
  stabilize provider networks.</p>
