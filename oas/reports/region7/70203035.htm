<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The purpose of this review was to determine the allowability of $717,106 in 
  post retirement benefit (PRB) costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement by Wellmark, 
  Inc. (Wellmark).&nbsp; The $717,106 represents PRB costs that will be incurred 
  subsequent to the termination of Wellmark’s Medicare contract.&nbsp; The review 
  showed that the claimed costs are unallowable for Medicare reimbursement and 
  we recommend that Wellmark withdraw the claim.&nbsp; Wellmark disagreed with 
  our report, asserting that the application of prior unclaimed administrative 
  costs (approximately $1.8 million) offsets our recommendation to withdraw the 
  claim for PRB costs.</p>
