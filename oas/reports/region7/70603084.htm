<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Administration on Aging (AoA) had (1) resolved all audit recommendations as of December 31, 2005, and (2) resolved audit recommendations in a timely manner during calendar years (CY) 2003&ndash;2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2005, AoA had not resolved 28 audit recommendations, all of which were within the allowable timeframe for resolution.&nbsp;During CYs 2003&ndash;2005, AoA resolved 291 of the 319 audit recommendations that were outstanding during this period.&nbsp;However, it did not resolve 207 of the 291 recommendations within the required 6-month period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that AoA resolve all audit recommendations within 6 months of receiving the audit reports as required.&nbsp;AoA concurred with our recommendation.</p>
