<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Pioneer Manor Care Center (Pioneer Manor) was in compliance with
  Federal and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing facilities. Pioneer Manor is a 150 bed Nursing Facility located
  in Gillette, Wyoming. Pioneer Manor complied with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations with one exception.&nbsp; Specifically,
  Pioneer Manor did not always document that employees were subject to a reference check and verification that the employee
  was not excluded from Federal health care programs. Wyoming regulations require facilities to maintain personnel records
  for each employee and those should be current and available and should contain sufficient information to support placement
  in the position assigned.</p>
