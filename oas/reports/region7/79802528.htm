<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Medicare Contractor's 
  Overfunded Pension Plan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. During our 
  previous review of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (the Association) 
  (CIN: A-07-95-01109), we determined that the Medicare segment accumulated $492,293 
  in unabsorbed credits as of January 1, 1994. The unabsorbed credits were created 
  by negative CAS pension costs, which resulted from the overfunded status of 
  the Association's pension plan. Our current review shows that the accumulated 
  unabsorbed credits increased to $710,699 as of December 31, 1995. The increase 
  resulted from appreciation on the accumulated unabsorbed credits, and from additional 
  negative CAS pension costs for 1994 and 1995. <br wp="br1" />
  <br wp="br2" />
  The CAS relating to the accounting for pension costs was revised effective March 
  30, 1995, and became applicable to the Association on January 1, 1996. The revised 
  CAS requires that accumulated unabsorbed credits and negative CAS pension costs 
  be assigned to subsequent accounting periods, as an &quot;assignable cost credit&quot;. 
  Additionally, the revised CAS requires that assignable cost credits be amortized 
  over ten years. <br wp="br1" />
  <br wp="br2" />
  We recommend that the Association identify $710,699 as an assignable cost credit, 
  attributable to the Medicare segment, as of January 1, 1996. The Association 
accepted our recommendations. </p>
