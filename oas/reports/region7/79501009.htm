<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report discusses the Emergency Assistance Program administered by 
  the Kansas Department of Social Services and Rehabilitation Services (SRS). 
  The objective of the review was to ascertain whether SRS practices for administering 
  Emergency Assistance (EA) complied with Federal requirements, and identify the 
  reason(s) EA costs increased from $800,00 in 1991 to $18 million in 1994. We 
  identified unallowable EA costs totaling $1,260,351 (Federal financial participation 
  or FFP $630,175). Based on practices in effect, we concluded that other EA costs 
  totaling $18,969,612 (FFP $9,484,806) may also include unallowable costs. We 
  recommended that SRS: (1) implement controls to ensure that costs charged to 
  EA comply with Federal regulations, and (2) make financial adjustments for costs 
  improperly claimed. </p>
