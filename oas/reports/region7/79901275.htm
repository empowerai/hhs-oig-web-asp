<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability 
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process 
  for determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed 
  care organizations (MCO). At a Missouri risk-based MCO we found that the Medicare 
  administrative cost component of the Plan's 1997 ACR proposal exceeded the Plan's 
  actual 1997 administrative expenses for the Plan's entire operation by approximately 
  $21 million. We also identified unsupported costs of $2,131,749 for items such 
  as management fees, commissions, rental/lease costs, and interest on long-term 
  debt, and costs of $69,594 for items such as entertainment, charitable donations, 
  political contributions, lobbying, and public relations that would not be allowable 
  if existing Medicare regulations, applicable to other parts of the Medicare 
  program, were applied to risk-based MCOs. The methodology which allows MCOs 
  to apportion administrative costs to Medicare is flawed and results in Medicare 
  covering a disproportionate amount of the MCO's administrative costs. Additional 
  reviews are ongoing and preliminary results show similar problems at other MCOs. 
  The results of these reviews are being shared with the Health Care Health Financing 
  Administration so that appropriate legislative changes can be considered. </p>
