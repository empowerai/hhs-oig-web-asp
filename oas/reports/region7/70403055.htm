<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if intergovernmental transfers between Iowa
  and publicly owned hospitals included any Medicaid graduate medical education funds.&nbsp; <a>We
  found that </a> Medicaid graduate medical education funds were included in intergovernmental
  transfers between Iowa and the University of Iowa Hospitals.&nbsp; The University of Iowa
  Hospitals (a publicly owned hospital) returned Medicaid graduate medical education funds
  of $24.1 million to the State as intergovernmental transfers with no assurance that funds
  would be used for the graduate medical education program or to provide services to Medicaid-eligible
  individuals.&nbsp; Since the entire $24.1 million graduate medical education payment was
  returned, Iowa incurred no liability for the overall graduate medical education program and
  actually realized a net gain of $6.6 million.&nbsp; We provided the State agency with an
  opportunity to respond to the audit findings.&nbsp; Because the audit did not contain any
  recommendations, the State agency elected not to submit written comments on the audit results
  in this report.</p>
