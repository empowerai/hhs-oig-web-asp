<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if the Nebraska Department of Health and Human
  Services, Finance and Support (State agency) properly claimed payments for skilled professional
  medical personnel at the enhanced Federal funding rate for fiscal year (FY) 2003. We found
  that the State agency did not properly claim payments for skilled professional medical personnel
  at the enhanced Federal funding rate for FY 2003.&nbsp; Specifically, the State agency claimed
  costs for:&nbsp; (1) personnel who did not meet the education requirements, (2) personnel
  in positions that did not require medical expertise, (3) directly supporting staff who did
  not meet supervision or job responsibility requirements, and (4) activities that did not
  require medical knowledge or skills.&nbsp; The State agency improperly claimed operating
  costs at the enhanced rate and claimed some duplicate costs.</p>
<p>We recommended the State agency should:&nbsp; (1) remit the $248,660 for duplicate claims
  to the Federal Government, (2) refund $292,903 to the Federal Government for costs improperly
  claimed at the enhanced rate, (3)&nbsp;work with CMS to resolve the $619,219 set aside because
  the State agency improperly claimed personnel costs related to claims processing, and (4)
  develop and implement policies and procedures for claiming skilled professional medical personnel
  expenditures and monitoring payments.&nbsp; The State agency either agreed or partially agreed
  with the four recommendations.</p>
