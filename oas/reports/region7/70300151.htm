<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit
    was to determine if capitation payments to IHA (Contract H3362) were appropriate
    for beneficiaries reported as institutionalized during the audit period.&nbsp; We
    determined that IHA received Medicare overpayments totaling approximately $18,400
    for 36 beneficiaries incorrectly classified as institutionalized.&nbsp; The overpayments
    occurred because of lack of oversight of internal control procedures.&nbsp; We
    recommended that IHA refund the overpayments, and ensure policies and procedures
    regarding the verification of institutionalized beneficiaries are followed correctly.&nbsp; The
    IHA concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
