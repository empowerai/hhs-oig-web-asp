<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if Colorado claimed Medicaid
  fee-for-service family planning costs for FY 1999 in accordance with Federal
  laws and regulations.&nbsp; We found that Colorado did not claim these
  costs in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; Colorado claimed
  $1,153,986 that did not qualify as family planning costs, which caused $454,786
  in excessive Federal Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; Colorado treated negative
  adjustments as paid claims and classified nonfamily planning claims as family
  planning because its computer programs did not ensure that negative adjustment
  amounts were subtracted instead of added or that nonfamily planning costs were
  extracted from all inpatient claims.&nbsp; We recommend that Colorado:&nbsp; (1) &nbsp;refund
  $454,786 to the Federal Government, (2) ensure claims for family planning are
  based on accurate and reliable information, and (3) review the $12.1 million
  in Federal reimbursement received for family planning services under fee-for-service
  for FY 2000 to December 2003 for errors and refund unallowable costs.&nbsp; Colorado
agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
