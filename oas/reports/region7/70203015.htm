<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The purpose of this review was to determine the allowability of pension costs 
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement for Fiscal Years (FYs) 1987 through 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  For FYs 1987 through 1999, we determined that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota 
  (Minnesota) over claimed Medicare pension costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, 
  the allowable Medicare pension costs were $7,108,225.&nbsp; However, Minnesota 
  claimed pension costs of $7,658,308 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, 
  Minnesota over claimed pension costs by $550,083.&nbsp; This over claim of pension 
  costs was the result of Minnesota basing their pension cost calculations on 
  incorrect asset values.&nbsp; We recommended Minnesota remit $550,083 to the 
  Federal Government.&nbsp; Minnesota agreed with our finding and recommendation.</p>
