<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>E<strong>XECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objectives of our review were to determine if (1) the compensation practices for five key executives
  and teachers were reasonable and consistent with Federal requirements and guidelines; and (2) KCMC’s
  administrative costs were allowable and reasonable in accordance with the Head Start Act, corresponding
  regulations at 45 CFR part 1301, and OMB Circulars A-110 and A-122.&nbsp; <a>We found that </a>Compensation
  for the teachers was reasonable and consistent with Federal requirements and guidelines. &nbsp;With
  regard to executive salaries, the executive director’s was not reasonable, and there was no clear written
  policy on compensation for any of the executives.&nbsp; In addition, certain other administrative costs
  were unallowable or unsupported.&nbsp; We recommend that KCMC refund $953,245 of questioned administrative
  costs. &nbsp; KCMS did not comment on our findings and recommendation.</p>
