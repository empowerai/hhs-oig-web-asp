<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of pension costs that Florida claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal
  years (FYs) 1994 through 2003.&nbsp; We found that Florida overclaimed $780,087 of Medicare pension costs for FYs 1994
  through 2003 because it understated the Medicare segment’s pension assets and did not account for a reorganization of the
  segment in 2002.&nbsp; Florida claimed pension costs of $24,296,727 for Medicare reimbursement; however, allowable Medicare
  pension costs were $23,516,640.&nbsp; We recommend that Florida: (1) revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP)
  for FYs 1994 through 2003 to reduce its claimed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension costs by $780,087, (2) update its
  Medicare segment assets in accordance with CAS 412 and 413, and (3) ensure that reorganizations to its Medicare segment
  are accounted for in accordance with the Medicare contract.&nbsp; Florida agreed with our report findings.&nbsp; Florida’s
  comments are presented in Appendix B to this report.</p>
