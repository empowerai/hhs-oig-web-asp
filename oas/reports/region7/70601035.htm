<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Senate Finance Committee requested that OIG assess the 
fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations with respect 
to six specified fiscal integrity areas.<br>
<br>
Of the $10.3 million of costs reviewed, $9.6<a name="tm_335548314">&nbsp;</a>million 
appeared reasonable for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; Of the remaining costs, the Iowa 
Foundation for Medical Care (IFMC) incurred $208,974 of costs that were 
unallowable and $530,822 of costs that may not have 
complied with Federal requirements.<br>
<br>
OIG recommended that IFMC (1) refund $179,358, which includes $145,091 of direct 
costs and $34,267 of associated indirect costs, for unallowable food and 
equipment; (2) reduce the indirect cost pool by $29,61<a name="tm_335548384">6</a><a name="tm_335548284">
</a>for chartered air travel costs incurred by board members; and (3) work with 
the CMS contracting officer to determine what portion of the $530,822 incurred 
for board member fees, board member travel costs, and executive compensation 
during our audit period should be excluded from the indirect cost pool for 
purposes of determining final rates.&nbsp; IFMC disagreed with the recommendations.</p>
