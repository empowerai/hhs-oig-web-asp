<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of the postretirement benefit (PRB) costs Pennsylvania
  Blue Shield (PBS) claimed for Medicare reimbursement on an accrual basis.&nbsp; PBS did not include
  in its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACPs) all of the PRB costs that were allowable pursuant
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; As a result, for FYs 1994 through 1997, PBS did not claim $153,675 of
  PRB costs that were allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; In addition, PBS did not receive CMS
  approval for its change in accounting practice for PRB costs.&nbsp; PBS should revise its FACPs for
  FYs 1994 through 1997 or submit a claim for additional allowable PRB costs of $153,675.&nbsp; After
  addressing the issues raised under Other Matters, PBS should seek approval for its change in accounting
  practice. </p>
<p>PBS disagreed with our report and stated that:&nbsp; “The cost allocation method used by PBS differed
  from the one used by the auditors in preparing this report.&nbsp; In addition, several of the data
  input numbers used by the auditors are not consistent with PBS data.”&nbsp; PBS also stated that it
  did seek CMS approval for its change in accounting practice for PRB costs.&nbsp; Additionally, PBS
  disagreed with our statement in the Other Matters section that PBS should be precluded from including
  unfunded PRB costs in any future claims to the Federal Government.&nbsp; PBS believed that by requiring
  contractors to use SFAS 106 in calculating PRB costs, the Federal Acquisition Regulations irreconcilably
  conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service limitations on Voluntary Employee Benefit Association funding.</p>
