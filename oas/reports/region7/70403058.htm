<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the State agency’s 
claims for Medicaid reimbursement of graduate medical education (GME) payments 
to Children’s Mercy Hospital (the hospital) complied with Federal law and the 
approved State plan.<br>
<br>
The State agency’s claims for Medicaid reimbursement of GME payments to the 
hospital did not fully comply with Federal law or the approved State plan.&nbsp; Of 
the $5,678,794 ($3,440,926 Federal share) claimed, $3,440,926 ($2,084,984 
Federal share) was allowable, and the remaining $2,237,868 ($1,355,942 Federal 
share) was not allowable. &nbsp;Specifically, the State agency was not entitled to 
claim certified public expenditures as the State share of GME costs.&nbsp; In 
addition, we were unable to determine what portion of the certified public 
expenditures, which were intended for the care of indigent children, related to 
the provision of GME.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government the 
$1,355,942 in GME overpayments to the hospital during State fiscal years 1999 
through 2001, (2) follow Federal requirements and the State plan when claiming 
GME costs in the future, and (3) review claims for GME subsequent to our audit 
period and refund any portion that did not comply with Federal requirements and 
the State plan.&nbsp; The State agency disagreed with the first recommendation but 
agreed with the two remaining recommendations.</p>
