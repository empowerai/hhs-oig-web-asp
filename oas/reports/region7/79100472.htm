<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
  of Texas, Inc.'s (Texas) implementation of its Medicare contract clause on pension
  plan segmentation. Texas identified four Medicare segments in 1981 using cost centers
  instead of responsible organizational units specified in the contract. Texas' identification
  methodology understated the actuarial liability fraction. When applied to the 1986
  pension assets, Texas' fraction understated Medicare's pension assets as of 1986
  by $552,870. We recommended that Medicare's segmented assets be increased by $552,870.
  Medicare's pension assets were understated by another $880,874 in the updating
  of Medicare's segmented assets from 1986 to 1990. The understatement occurred because
  Texas incorrectly identified the Medicare segments and had not adjusted for participant
  transfers in and out of the Medicare segments after 1986. We recommended that Texas
  increase pension assets of the Medicare segments by an additional $880,874. Texas
  generally agreed with our recommendations. The Health Care Financing Administration
  also agreed with our findings and recommendations. </p>
