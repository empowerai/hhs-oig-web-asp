<h2>08-19-2009<br />
Review of the Missouri Department of Social Services Claims for Title IV-E Training Costs for the Social Services Cost Pool for July 1, 2002, Through June 30, 2006</h2>

<h2 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>We found that none of the $10.2 million ($7.7 million Federal share) in Title IV-E (foster care and adoption assistance) training costs that Missouri allocated from its social services cost pool from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2006, were allowable for Federal reimbursement at the enhanced 75-percent Federal financial participation rate.  Of the $7.7 million Federal share, $2.6 million was unallowable because the cost pool did not consist entirely of allowable training costs reimbursable at the enhanced rate.  In addition, contrary to Federal regulations, none of the costs included in the cost pool were included in the State's approved training plan. We set aside an additional $3.3 million for adjudication by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and accepted the remaining $1.8 million.</p>

<p>We recommended that Missouri (1) adjust its next "Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Financial Report" to reduce Federal reimbursement claimed for Title IV-E training by $2.6 million and (2) work with ACF to determine what portion of the $3.3 million Federal share was not allocable to Title IV-E and make financial adjustments as necessary.  Missouri did not agree with our findings or recommendations.  Nothing in the State's comments caused us to revise our report.</p>
