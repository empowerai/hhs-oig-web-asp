<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the State paid claims 
  for deceased Medicaid recipients during the period October 1, 1998 through December 
  31, 2001 and, if so, to determine the amount of the unallowable payments.&nbsp; 
  To accomplish our objective, we identified, using computer analysis, 75,193 
  claims representing 2,939 Medicaid recipients that were potentially paid after 
  the date of death.&nbsp; Subsequently, we selected a statistical sample of 200 
  from the 2,939 recipients for further review and determined, with the State’s 
  concurrence, that claims of $20,242 for 97 Medicaid recipients were unallowable.&nbsp; 
  Projected for the 2,939 recipients, we estimated that unallowable claims paid 
  for services after death totaled $196,232 (Federal share $118,362).&nbsp; However, 
  the State indicated that not all claims were recoverable due to their age.&nbsp; 
  Our review also showed that unallowable payments were due, in part, because 
  the State was maintaining incorrect or missing information in the Medicaid Management 
  Information System (MMIS), the database used for monitoring payments made after 
  the date of death.</p>
