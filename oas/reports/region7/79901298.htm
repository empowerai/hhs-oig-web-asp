<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA) paid $4.1 million to managed care organizations (MCOs) for deceased beneficiaries 
  in 4 States (Arizona, California, Colorado, and Florida). These 4 States represent 
  about 43 percent of all Medicare risk-based enrollees. The HCFA has recouped 
  about $833,000, but over $3.2 million remains outstanding because HCFA was not 
  aware of all of the deaths and did not take action to collect some of the improper 
  overpayments. Further, HCFA continues to pay at least $700,000 per year to MCOs 
  for the deceased beneficiaries identified by our review. We recommended that 
  HCFA identify and recoup Medicare payments in all States made on behalf of deceased 
  beneficiaries, including the $3.2 million identified in this report. We also 
  recommended that HCFA continue to strengthen procedures to prevent and detect 
  payments to MCOs for deceased beneficiaries. The HCFA concurred with our recommendations.
