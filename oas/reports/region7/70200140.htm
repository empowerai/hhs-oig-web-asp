<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Ryan White Title I funds
  awarded to the Kansas City Health Department (KCHD) for fiscal years (FY) 1998,
  1999, and 2000 were administered in accordance with federal guidelines.&nbsp; 
  During calendar year 2001, the KCHD encountered many significant issues, including 
  a restriction of its ability to draw funds by the HRSA and a task force organized 
  by the Mayor of Kansas City to rectify Ryan White Title I administration concerns.&nbsp; 
  The KCHD did not perform required programmatic reviews on certain service categories. 
  &nbsp;As a result, the Kansas City EMA may not have been able to assess the 
  quality of care administered by the contractors to the Ryan White beneficiaries, 
  including such critical categories as primary and dental care.&nbsp; Also, the 
  KCHD provided inaccurate information on annual applications to HSRA, which may 
  have resulted in an unfair advantage for the KCHD when competing with other 
  EMAs for funding.&nbsp; In addition, KCHD did not always follow certain technical 
  requirements in the operation of the program.&nbsp; Specifically, we found one
   instance where the KCHD had: (1) allocated and prioritized funding, which is
  a function required of the Planning Council and (2) charged administrative costs
  inappropriately to program cost categories.</p>
