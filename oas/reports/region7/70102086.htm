<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p >The purpose of this review, performed by the certified 
  public accounting firm of Carmichael, Brasher, Tuvell &amp; Company, was to 
  determine whether administrative costs claimed by the General American Life 
  Insurance Company (GALIC) to administer Part B of Medicare for the period October 
  1, 1993 through December 31, 1999 were reasonable, allocable, and allowable. 
  The auditors determined that GALIC had not established adequate systems for 
  internal control, accounting and reporting of indirect costs, fringe benefits, 
  miscellaneous costs, and termination costs. The GALIC could not provide sufficient 
  documentation for these costs and the auditors could not determine the allowability 
  of such costs through other auditing procedures. As a result, the auditors questioned 
  and recommended for disallowance about $42.8 million of administrative costs 
  claimed over the audit period.</p>
