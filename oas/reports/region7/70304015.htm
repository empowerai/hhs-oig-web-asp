<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to evaluate whether the
  Wyoming Department of Health Pharmacy Unit (the State agency) had established
  adequate accountability and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate
  program.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found the State agency lacked sufficient internal controls
  with regard to the Medicaid drug rebate program as required by federal rules
  and regulations.&nbsp; The State agency did not develop or follow adequate
  policies and procedures with regard to the drug rebate program and its management
  by Affiliated Computer Services, a company the State agency contracted with
  to administer the drug rebate program.&nbsp; Further,
  the State agency did not have reasonable assurance that drug rebate balances
  and collections reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
  were accurate.&nbsp; We believe that the State agency could increase its drug
  rebate collections by using the State Agency’s hearing mechanism to resolve
  disputes.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of sufficient internal controls increased
the risk for fraud, waste, or abuse of drug rebate program funds.</p>
