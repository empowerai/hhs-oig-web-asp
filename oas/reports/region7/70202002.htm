<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine the allowability of Title IV-E training
  costs claimed by the Missouri Department of Social Services (State agency) for the period
  July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2002.&nbsp; The State agency did not always follow Federal
  regulations regarding allowability of costs, resulting in overstated Title IV-E training
  costs of $15,256,317 (Federal share).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency:&nbsp; (1) adjust its next Federal
  Quarterly Report of Expenditures to reduce Federal reimbursement claimed for Title IV-E training
  by $15,256,317, (2) work with ACF to determine the amount of unallowable training costs claimed
  at the 75&#8209;percent Federal reimbursement rate that are claimable and allowable as Title
  IV-E administrative costs at the 50&#8209;percent rate, (3) develop and implement internal
  controls to ensure that only allowable training costs are claimed as Title IV-E training
  costs in the future, and (4) review Title IV-E training costs claimed subsequent to our audit
  period for the issues identified and make the appropriate adjustments.&nbsp; The State agency
  disagreed with our recommendations<span class="101314719-15032006"> and four </span>of&nbsp;<span class="101314719-15032006">our </span>six
  findings.</p>
