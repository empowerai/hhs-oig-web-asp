<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objectives of our review were to:&nbsp; (1) determine if the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our
  prior review were accounted for properly; (2) determine if pension costs were funded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition
  Regulations (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS); and (3) identify and properly account for any additional accumulated
  unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; We found that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida (Florida) did not properly account for the
  accumulated unfunded pension costs identified in our prior review.&nbsp; Florida understated the accumulated unallowable
  pension costs by $2,346,492.&nbsp; We also found that Florida funded pension costs in accordance with FAR and CAS.&nbsp; As
  such, there were no additional unfunded pension costs to identify and update.&nbsp; We recommended that Florida increase
  the accumulated unallowable pension costs by $2,346,492 and implement controls to identify and properly account for unfunded
  unallowable pension costs.&nbsp; Florida agreed with our findings.</p>
