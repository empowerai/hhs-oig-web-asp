<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether:&nbsp; (1) North Dakota was monitoring nursing homes to ensure
  compliance with institutions for mental disease (IMD) criteria; and (2) nursing homes participating in the North Dakota
  Medicaid program were IMDs.&nbsp; We reviewed nursing homes participating in the Medicaid program during Federal fiscal
  year 2003.&nbsp; North Dakota needs to establish specific controls to monitor nursing homes for compliance with IMD criteria.&nbsp; We
  recommended that North Dakota further monitor and evaluate, with qualified medical personnel, the four nursing homes that
  may be IMDs.&nbsp; North Dakota did not agree with our recommendation to establish specific controls to monitor nursing
  homes for compliance with IMD criteria.</p>
