<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Unlike other areas of the Medicare program, there is no statutory or regulatory
  authority governing the allowability of costs in determining adjusted community
  rates (ACRs) for Medicare+Choice organizations (M+CO).&nbsp; This review of
  a Missouri M+CO was made to determine if the administrative costs were reasonable,
  necessary, and allocable when compared to Medicare's general principle of paying
  only reasonable costs.&nbsp; We found, however that the ACR included $151,049
  for the costs of promotional giveaways, donations, sponsorships, lobbying,
  and entertainment.&nbsp; The results of this review, along with the results
  of similar reviews of other M+CO organizations are being shared with the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services so that appropriate legislative changes
  can be considered.</p>
