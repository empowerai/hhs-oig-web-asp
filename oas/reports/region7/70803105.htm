<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="CM46" style="line-height:13.65pt">In a follow-up audit of North 
Dakota’s Medicaid drug rebate program, we found that the State had partially 
implemented procedures to correct the weakness relating to billing and tracking 
$0 unit rebate amounts (URA) that we identified in our previous audit.&nbsp; 
Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid 
funding by entering into a rebate agreement with CMS and paying quarterly 
rebates to the States.&nbsp; We also found that the State did not have a mechanism to 
adequately monitor disputed drug rebates.&nbsp; Further, the State did not have 
written policies and procedures governing the calculation of interest on unpaid 
balances from drug manufacturers and generally lacked written policies and 
procedures over the drug rebate program. &nbsp;Finally, although the State had 
established controls over collecting rebates on single-source drugs administered 
by physicians, the procedures did not fully comply with the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005 (DRA).<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State develop procedures to track $0 URA line items and 
notify manufacturers when they fail to remit proper URA payment; track open and 
closed disputed drug rebates and make the State’s hearing mechanism available to 
manufacturers; <span style="font-size:11.5pt">invoice manufacturers for interest 
when appropriate; and properly report all rebates invoiced, rebate collections, 
and accounts receivables to ensure that CMS receives accurate drug rebate 
information.&nbsp; We also recommended that the State ensure that it complies with 
the DRA’s timeframes for invoicing physician-administered drugs.&nbsp; Finally, 
we recommended that the State invoice manufacturers for single-source 
physician-administered drugs as required by the DRA and the “State Medicaid 
Manual.”<br>
<br>
</span>The State did not specifically address our findings and recommendations 
but said that it would develop written procedures regarding the drug rebate 
program and procedures specific to physician-administered drugs.&nbsp; The State also 
said that it had invoiced manufacturers for single-source physician-administered 
drugs.</p>
