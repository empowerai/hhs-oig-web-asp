<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) served as a Medicare contractor 
  until their contract was terminated in October 2001. Federal regulations and 
  Medicare contract provisions require pension gains, which occur when a Medicare 
  segment of a contractor’s pension plan closes, be credited to the Medicare program. 
  We identified about $5.3 million in excess Medicare pension assets at BCBSNC 
  at the time of contract termination. Our methodology and calculations were reviewed 
  by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ pension actuarial staff. 
  We are recommending that BCBSNC refund the $5.3 million to the Medicare program.</p>
