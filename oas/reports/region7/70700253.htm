<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (Empire), a CMS contractor, properly implemented 
our prior audit recommendation 
regarding an earlier review of its Medicare segment pension assets; however, it 
did not always comply with Federal requirements and the Medicare contracts’ 
pension segmentation requirements while updating the Medicare segment pension 
assets from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2006.&nbsp; As a result, Empire 
overstated the Medicare segment pension assets by $131,494.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Empire decrease its Medicare segment 
pension assets as of December 31, 2006, by $131,494. <a name="tm_1073741917">&nbsp;</a>Empire’s 
Medicare contract was transferred to National Government Systems (NGS) effective 
January 1, 2007.&nbsp; NGS agreed with our recommendation.</p>
