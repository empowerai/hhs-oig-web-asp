<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Infinia at Granite Hills, Inc. (Infinia) was in compliance with
  federal and state staffing laws and regulations for nursing facilities.&nbsp; Federal and State regulations require that
  the facility employ a Registered Nurse (RN) for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.&nbsp; The facility did
  not routinely meet this requirement.&nbsp; Also, Utah regulations require that direct care nursing stuff such as certified
  nurse assistants be currently certified in the state of Utah.&nbsp; One Certified Nurse Assistant had an expired certificate.&nbsp; Another
  was certified in California, not in Utah.&nbsp; Utah regulations require that nursing facilities maintain direct care staff
  licenses or certifications for review.&nbsp; Infinia did not have the certifications on file for four of the facility's
  Certified Nursing Assistants as required.&nbsp; Utah regulations require facilities such as nursing facilities perform
  a Bureau of Criminal Identification screening.&nbsp; The facility did not have documentation to show that the screening
  had been performed on two of its direct care employees.&nbsp; We recommended that Infinia take action to ensure, the facility
  is staffed with an RN for 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week; all direct care nursing staff hold current Utah licenses,
  certifications, or registrations; copies of licenses and certifications for all direct care nursing staff are maintained
  at the facility; and Evidence of Bureau of Criminal Identification screenings is maintained.&nbsp; Infinia agreed with
  our recommendations and has agreed to take corrective action.</p>
