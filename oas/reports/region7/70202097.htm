<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>Our objective was to review
  the role of the Missouri Hospital Association (MHA) and its subsidiary corporation
  MHA Management Services Corporation (MHA/MSC), in the disbursement of Medicaid
  disproportionate share (DSH) funds to hospital providers.&nbsp; A further objective
  was to determine whether DSH funds were received by Missouri hospitals in accordance
  with federal regulations and the Missouri Medicaid State plan (State plan).&nbsp; During
  the three-year period of our review, the State of Missouri claimed $1.5 billion
  in federal financial participation (FFP) for DSH payments to hospitals.&nbsp; We
  found that Missouri hospitals receive DSH payments in accordance with federal
  regulations and the State plan.&nbsp; However, subsequent voluntary redistributions
  of DSH funds by the MHA/MSC result in DSH funds being used to support Missouri’s
  Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) program rather than to provide financial
  support to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid patients.</p>
