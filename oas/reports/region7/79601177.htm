<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office 
  of Audit Services (OAS) review titled <em>Post Retirement Benefit Costs Claimed 
  by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan</em>. The purpose of our review was 
  to determine the allowability of $8,979,998 in post retirement benefit (Post 
  Retirement) costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement by Blue Cross and Blue 
  Shield of Michigan (Michigan). The $8,979,998 represents Post Retirement costs 
  that will be incurred subsequent to the termination of Michigan's Medicare contracts. 
  The review showed that the claimed costs are unallowable for Medicare reimbursement 
  and we recommend that Michigan withdraw the claim. </p>
<p>Michigan disagrees with our recommendation and maintains that the Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for reimbursing Post Retirement 
  costs attributable to Michigan's administration of Medicare. </p>
