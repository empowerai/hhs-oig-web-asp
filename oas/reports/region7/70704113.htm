<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Our objective was to 
determine whether the </span>Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and 
Financing's <span style="layout-grid-mode:
line">(the State agency) claims for reimbursement of Medicaid outpatient drug 
expenditures complied with Federal requirements. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">The State agency’s 
claims for reimbursement of Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures for fiscal 
years 2003 and 2004 did not fully comply with Federal requirements.&nbsp; Of the
</span>$489 million ($255<span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> </span>million 
Federal share) claimed, $21,678 (<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Federal 
share) represents expenditures for drug products that were not eligible for 
Medicaid coverage because they were</span> terminated drugs for which the 
termination dates were listed on the CMS quarterly drug tapes before the drugs 
were dispensed.&nbsp; An additional $459,604 (Federal share) represents expenditures 
for drug products that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes.&nbsp; Because the 
State agency did not verify whether the drugs missing from the tapes were 
eligible for Medicaid coverage, these drug expenditures may not be allowable for 
Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) refund
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">$21,678</span> to the Federal Government
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">for drug expenditures that were not eligible 
for Medicaid coverage, (2) work with CMS to resolve </span>$459,604
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">in payments for drugs that were not listed 
on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have been eligible for Medicaid 
coverage, and (3) </span>strengthen internal controls to ensure that claimed 
Medicaid drug expenditures comply with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State 
agency concurred with our first recommendation, did not concur with our second 
recommendation, and partially concurred with our third recommendation.</p>
