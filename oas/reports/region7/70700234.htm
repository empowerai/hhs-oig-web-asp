<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine the allowability of the 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) costs that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
of South Carolina (South Carolina) claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal 
years (FY) 1999–2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">South Carolina’s claim for $5,920,947 in SERP costs for FYs 
1999–2004 included some costs that were unreasonable and therefore unallowable 
for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; However, we were unable to determine the impact of 
these unallowable compensation costs on SERP costs because South Carolina did 
not provide us with the necessary documentation to support its SERP 
calculations.&nbsp; Therefore, we are setting aside the $5,920,947 in claimed SERP 
costs for adjudication by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that South Carolina work with CMS to 
determine the allowability of $5,920,947 in SERP costs claimed for FYs 
1999–2004.&nbsp; South Carolina concurred with our recommendation.</p>
