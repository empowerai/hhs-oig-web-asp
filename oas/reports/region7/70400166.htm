<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> Our objective was to determine the allowability of the postretirement benefit (PRB) costs Highmark
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement on an accrual basis for fiscal years (FY) 1998 through 2002.&nbsp; We
  found that the PRB costs Highmark claimed on an accrual basis for FYs 1998 through 2002 were allowable.&nbsp; However,
  Highmark did not include in its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACPs) all of the PRB costs that
  were allowable pursuant to Federal regulations.&nbsp; As a result, for FYs 1998 through 2002, Highmark
  did not claim $2,961,526 of PRB costs that was allowable for Medicare reimbursement. </p>
<p>We recommended Highmark should revise its FACPs for FYs 1998 through 2002 or submit a claim for additional
  allowable PRB costs of $2,961,526. Highmark did not agree with our calculations of allowable PRB pension
  costs.&nbsp; Highmark also stated that it did not need to seek CMS approval for its change in accounting
  practice for PRB costs, because it was a continuation of the prior PBS program.&nbsp; Additionally,
  Highmark disagreed with our statement in the Other Matters section that Highmark should be precluded
  from including unfunded PRB costs in any future claims to the Federal Government.&nbsp; Highmark believed
  that “by requiring contractors to use [S]FAS 106 in calculating PRB costs, the FAR irreconcilably conflicts
  with the [Internal Revenue Service] limitations on VEBA funding.”</p>
