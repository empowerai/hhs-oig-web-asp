<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed by
  Arizona for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1991 through 2005.&nbsp; We found
  that Arizona claimed $142,343 of unallowable Medicare pension costs for FYs 1991 through
  2005 due to the differences in the calculated allocable pension costs. &nbsp;Arizona claimed
  $1,737,918 of pension costs for Medicare reimbursement; however we calculated the allowable
  Medicare pension costs during this period to be $1,595,575.&nbsp; We recommended that Arizona
  revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals for FYs 1991 through 2005 to reduce its claimed
  pension costs by $142,343.&nbsp; Arizona agreed with our recommendation.</p>
