<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to evaluate Hawaii Medical Service Association's
  (HMSA) compliance with the pension segmentation requirements of its Medicare
  contract and to determine the excess assets that should be remitted to Medicare
  as a result of the termination of the Medicare contractual relationship effective
  June 30, 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We computed excess Medicare pension assets
  of $456,481 as of January 1, 2000.&nbsp; In our opinion, the excess pension
  assets were the result of HMSA terminating the Medicare program and transferring
  all remaining Medicare liabilities out of the Medicare segment.&nbsp; We recommended
  HMSA remit the $456,481 of excess Medicare pension assets resulting from the
  termination of its Medicare contract to the Federal Government.</p>
