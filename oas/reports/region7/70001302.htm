<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report addresses the effectiveness of procedures used by Montana's
  Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) and its Medicaid contractor
  to ensure Medicaid is the payer of last resort. The audit was made by the Montana
  Legislative Audit Division (LAD) as part of the Office of Inspector General's
  partnership efforts with State auditors to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid
  program. The LAD found that, overall, the State agency properly denied payment
  for medical services that were the responsibility of third parties and appropriately
  denied duplicate claims that were submitted for the same services, ensuring
  that Medicaid was the payer of last resort. However, the LAD did note some
  procedural weaknesses, and recommended that DPHHS establish policies to ensure
  compliance with the State's statute requiring the recording of receivables
  and disposition of uncollectible revenue and complete an analysis of the recovery
  of Medicaid funds to determine if procedures used for recovery maximize collection
  efforts. The DPHHS concurred with the recommendations. </p>
