<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This report provides the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG),
  Office of Audit Services (OAS) review titled &quot;Review of Pension Costs
  Claimed for Medicare Reimbursement by Independence Blue Cross.&quot;&nbsp; The
  purpose of our review was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed
  for Medicare reimbursement for Fiscal Years 1987 through 1997. During this
  period, the allowable Medicare pension costs were $2,150,995.&nbsp; However,
  Independence Blue Cross (IBC) claimed pension costs of $1,051,012 for Medicare
  reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, IBC did not claim $1,099,983 in allowable
  pension costs.&nbsp; This under claim of pension costs primarily occurred because
  IBC neglected to include certain pension contribution amounts on their Final
  Administrative Cost Proposals (FACPs).&nbsp; We
  recommended IBC revise its FACPs to reflect the remaining allowable pension
  costs.&nbsp; While IBC agreed that any costs not claimed per its identification
  of the Medicare segment would be reimbursable, it did not agree with our identification
  of the segment.</p>
