<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments according
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; We found that the State agency did not report 93 Medicaid provider overpayments totaling
  $420,415 (Federal share) to CMS in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; As of March 31, 2004, seven of those overpayments,
  totaling $22,492 (Federal share), remained unreported.&nbsp; The State agency did not always follow established policies
  and procedures.&nbsp; Furthermore, its policies and procedures were not sufficient to ensure the timely reporting of all
  overpayments.&nbsp; We recommended that the State Agency (1) refund the Federal share of overpayments to the Federal Government,
  and (2) &nbsp;strengthen policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The
  State agency concurred with our findings and initiated corrective action.</p>
