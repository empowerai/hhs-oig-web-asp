<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out a method used by Nebraska to obtain additional
  Federal Medicaid funds by circumventing the Medicaid requirement that expenditures
  be a shared Federal/State responsibility. For fiscal years 1998 through 2000
  Nebraska made enhanced payments to public nursing facilities totaling $227
  million, generating about $139 million in Federal financial participation.
  The nursing facilities retained about $1.5 million and $225.5 million was returned
  to the State for other uses. For the funds transferred back to the State, the
  State share of the enhanced payments ($88 million) was returned to the Nebraska
  General Fund and the remaining $137.5 million in Federal matching funds was
  designated for the Nebraska Health Care Trust Fund. Because the $225.5 million
  was returned to the State, it appears that the State did not incur an expenditure
  for which Federal matching funds may be claimed. Among other things, we recommended
  that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) take immediate action
  to place a control on the overall financing mechanisms being used by the State
  to circumvent the Medicaid program requirement that expenditures be a shared
  Federal/State responsibility. The HCFA concurred and to address the problem
  has issued new regulations to be implemented over a transition period to become
  fully effective on October 1, 2008. During this transition period we estimate
  the Federal Government will save $142 million in Nebraska alone. </p>
