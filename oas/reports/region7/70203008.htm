<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This review was made to determine whether Medicare payments 
  were made for services to incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; Missouri was one 
  of ten states selected for review.&nbsp; During our review in Missouri we discovered 
  that there were two major groups of incarcerated individuals that potentially 
  could have had improper Medicare claims paid on their behalf.&nbsp; The first 
  group was comprised of state prisoners in state correctional facilities under 
  control of the Department of Corrections (DOC).&nbsp; The other group was individuals 
  who were residing in state mental health facilities under the control of the 
  Department of Mental Health (DMH).&nbsp; This group of individuals is comprised 
  of forensic patients who had been found either &quot;Not Guilty By Reason of 
  Insanity&quot; or &quot;Incompetent to Stand Trial&quot; by the court system.</p>
<p>For the first major group of incarcerated individuals, Missouri 
  Statute, sections 217.829 requires these individuals to reimburse the DOC for 
  the cost of their care while they were incarcerated.&nbsp; This law, if followed, 
  would allow the Missouri state prisons to bill Medicare.&nbsp; However, during 
  our review we learned that Missouri DOC has a contract with Correctional Medical 
  Services.&nbsp; Under this contract, Correctional Medical Services is required 
  to pay for all care provided to state prisoners.&nbsp; Therefore, the state 
  prisons should not bill any other insurance company, including Medicare, for 
  medical services provided to state prisoners.</p>
<p>For the second major group of incarcerated individuals, forensic 
  patients under the control of the Missouri DMH, Missouri Statute, section 552.080 
  requires these individuals to reimburse the DMH for the cost of care.&nbsp; 
  All 100 of Missouri's sample claims were for this group of individuals.&nbsp; 
  We found that DMH follows all of the various laws and regulations regarding 
  the diligent pursuit of payment and therefore all of the payments made by Medicare 
  for these claims were allowable.</p>
<p>We have been informed that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
  Services (CMS) plans to establish an edit in the common working file that will 
  deny claims for incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; Claims meeting the conditions 
  of payment will not be subject to this edit if the supplier or provider submitting 
  the claim certifies, by using a modifier or condition code on the claim, that 
  he or she has been instructed by the state or local government component that 
  the conditions for Medicare payment have been met.&nbsp; We recommended that 
  CMS:&nbsp; (1) make a concerted effort to educate suppliers and providers on 
  the meaning of the modifier or condition code and circumstances relating to 
  their proper use, (2) monitor claims with the modifier or condition code to 
  assure that federal guidelines are met, and (3) monitor claims to ensure that 
  only commitment codes that meet Medicare criteria are paid and that uniform 
  collection procedures are enforced.&nbsp; The CMS concurred with our findings 
  and recommendations.</p>
