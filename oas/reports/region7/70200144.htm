<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if the administrative costs claimed
  by Nebraska were allocable and allowable in accordance with applicable laws,
  regulations, and program policies.&nbsp; We found Nebraska overcharged the
  Foster Care IV-E program $1,137,031 (Federal share) in adjustments to prior
  periods and $3,198,511 (Federal share) for costs incurred.&nbsp; Specifically,
  Nebraska:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) overstated adjustments for prior periods because
  they used an incomplete, non-statistical case review process to reclassify
  foster care children as IV-E eligible; (2) allocated costs to the IV-E program
  that did not relate to foster care children; (3) did not allocate allowable
  costs for foster care licensing to the IV-E program (this resulted in an under
  claim); and (4) used allocation procedures that were outdated or not in accordance
  with their cost allocation plan.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments
  and procedural corrections.</p>
