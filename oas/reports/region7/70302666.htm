<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of our analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of HGSAdministrator's 
  (HGSA) claims processing system in identifying payment reductions for multiple 
  ambulatory surgical center procedures for calendar years 1997 through 2001.&nbsp; 
  Regulations require that when multiple services are provided in the same operative 
  session, the highest paying procedure is reimbursable at the full payment rate 
  while the other procedures are reimbursable at one-half the normal payment rate.&nbsp; 
  Our analysis showed that HGSA’s system failed to identify such instances, which 
  resulted in provider overpayments for calendar years 1997 through 2001 of approximately&nbsp; 
  $1,169, $6,037, $13,635, $10,053 and&nbsp; $4,942 ($35,836), respectively.&nbsp; 
  Included in the identified overpayments are approximately $7,178 in beneficiary 
  overpayments for coinsurance.&nbsp; Most of the overpayments occurred because 
  the carrier’s processing system did not identify multiple procedures performed 
  during the same session when submitted on separate claims.</p>
