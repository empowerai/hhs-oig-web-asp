<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objective of our review was to determine if the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments according to
  Federal regulations.&nbsp; We found that the State agency did not report all Medicaid provider overpayments on the quarterly
  CMS 64 reports in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State's policies and procedures were not sufficient to
  ensure the timely reporting of all overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency delayed returning 448 overpayments
  totaling $1,474,801 ($897,261 FFP).&nbsp; Of that amount, the State agency had not yet reported or returned to the Federal
  Government 353 overpayments totaling $767,304 ($467,599 FFP) as of September 7, 2004.&nbsp; We recommended that the State
  agency should:&nbsp; (1) return the Federal share of overpayments totaling $467,599 to the Federal Government and (2) establish
  policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported in accordance with Federal regulations. &nbsp;The State
  agency generally agreed with our findings and recommendations. &nbsp;It agreed to return $313,056, representing 345 overpayments,
  to the Federal Government and has initiated a repayment schedule for that amount.</p>
