<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objectives were to: &nbsp;(1) determine if the accumulated unfunded pension costs identified
  in our prior reviews were accounted for properly; (2) determine if pension costs for the
  audit period (1991–2002) were funded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations
  (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards&nbsp;(CAS); and (3) identify and properly account
  for any additional accumulated unfunded pension costs, including the identification of the
  unallowable and reassignable portions of the accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; We
  found that Anthem properly accounted for previously identified unfunded pension costs in
  accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; For the current audit period, Anthem funded its
  pension costs in accordance with the FAR and CAS.&nbsp; However, as a result of the merger
  with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Connecticut, Anthem has unallowable unfunded pension costs
  for the Other segment. &nbsp;The accumulated unallowable pension cost is $6,052,895 as of
  January 1, 2003.</p>
<p>We recommended that Anthem: (1) identify $6,052,895 of accumulated unallowable pension costs
  as of January 1, 2003, and (2) identify and properly track unallowable unfunded pension costs
  in subsequent years.&nbsp; Anthemagreed with our finding and recommendations and stated that
  it had already implemented policies and procedures to ensure that unallowable unfunded pension
  costs were properly tracked in the future.</p>
