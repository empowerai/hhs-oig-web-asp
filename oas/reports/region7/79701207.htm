<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Unfunded Pension Costs 
  of Community Mutual Insurance Company (Community Mutual) for Plan Years 1986 
  through 1995. Contributions were not made to the pension trust fund for Plan 
  Year 1988. Accordingly, Community Mutual did not fund the pension costs identifiable 
  with its Medicare segment during this period. As a result, Community Mutual 
  accumulated unfunded pension costs of $571,413 as of January 1, 1996. Community 
  Mutual must separately identify and eliminate this amount from the amortization 
  components of future pension costs. </p>
