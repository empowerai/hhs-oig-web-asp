<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Pension Costs Claimed 
  for Medicare Reimbursement by Community Mutual Insurance Company for Fiscal 
  Years 1988 through 1995. During this period, the allowable Medicare pension 
  costs were $2,043,579. However community Mutual Insurance Company (Community 
  Mutual) claimed pension costs of $3,035,551 for Medicare reimbursement. As a 
  result, Community Mutual claimed $991,972 in pension costs that were not allowable. 
  The over claim occurred primarily because Community Mutual's pension cost calculations 
  were based on incorrect asset values for the Medicare segment, and were not 
  computed in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Additionally, 
  Community Mutual used an inappropriate cost component when computing its indirect 
  Medicare line of business (LOB) percentage, which resulted in an overstatement 
  of the pension costs assigned to indirect Medicare operations. We recommended 
  that Community Mutual revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals to eliminate 
  the unallowable pension costs, and that Community Mutual base future claims 
  for pension costs on costs calculated in accordance with the CAS. We also recommended 
  that Community Mutual revise its methodology of calculating the indirect Medicare 
  LOB percentage. </p>
