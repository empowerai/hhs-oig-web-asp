<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Nebraska Department 
  of Health and Human Services System (HHSS) has continued to properly identify, 
  collect, and remit the federal share of AFDC overpayment collections to the 
  Federal Government after the AFDC program was repealed.&nbsp; The HHSS made 
  only one payment for the federal share of AFDC overpayment collections made 
  between October 1, 1996 and December 31, 2001.&nbsp; That payment totaled $21,654 
  and covered only the federal share of cash collections made in October and November 
  1996.&nbsp; The federal share of benefit reductions applied by the state for 
  that period was not remitted.&nbsp; No payments were made to the U.S. Department 
  of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF) 
  for the federal share of overpayment collections since a new program, Temporary 
  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), was implemented on December 1, 1996.&nbsp; 
  Instead, AFDC overpayment collections were incorrectly applied to the new program.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  We estimated the federal share of AFDC overpayments that the HHSS may have collected 
  between October 1, 1996 and December 31, 2001 to be about $2 million.</p>
