<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina (South Carolina) 
administers Medicare Part A and Part B operations in its Palmetto Government 
Benefit Administrators (Palmetto) and TrailBlazer Health Enterprises (TrailBlazer) 
subsidiaries under cost reimbursement contracts with the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine the allowability of the 
Excess Plan costs that South Carolina claimed for Medicare reimbursement for 
fiscal years (FY) 1996–2004.&nbsp; We found that South Carolina overclaimed 
$1,847,056<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>in accrued Excess Plan costs 
for FYs 1996–2004 because it improperly determined costs based on accrual 
accounting.<br>
<br>
We recommended that South Carolina revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals 
for FYs 1996–2004 for Palmetto and FYs 2000–2004 for TrailBlazer to reduce 
claimed Excess Plan costs by $1,847,056.&nbsp; In written comments on our draft 
report, South Carolina did not directly address our recommendation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
