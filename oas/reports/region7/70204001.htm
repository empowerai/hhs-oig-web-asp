<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Medicare 
  fee-for-service claims were: furnished by certified Medicare providers to eligible 
  beneficiaries; reimbursed by Medicare contractors in accordance with Medicare 
  laws and regulations; and medically necessary, accurately coded, and sufficiently 
  documented in the beneficiaries’ medical records.&nbsp; The period of this audit 
  was the quarter of January 2002 through March 2002.&nbsp; Our review of 423 
  claims totaling $240,656 disclosed that 58 claims did not comply with Medicare 
  laws and regulations.&nbsp; These 58 claims had 80 line item errors representing 
  $3,999 in improper payments.&nbsp; An additional 21 line items were billed for 
  less services or with a lower code than was supported by the medical records.&nbsp; 
  These 21 line items would have resulted in $2,689 in additional payments if 
  the provider had billed the maximum supportable code or number of services supported 
  by the medical records.&nbsp; One other line item was underpaid $72 because 
  it was manually priced incorrectly during the payment process.&nbsp; The combination 
  of the overpayments and underpayments resulted in a net overpayment to providers 
  totaling $1,238.&nbsp; When these claims were originally submitted to Noridian, 
  they contained no visible errors.&nbsp; In addition, we found that accounting 
  controls over certain financial statement activities need to be improved in 
  order to prevent misstatement of the CMS financial statements.</p>
