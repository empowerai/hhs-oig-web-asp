<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office 
  of Audit Services (OAS) review titled <em>Audit of the Pension Plan at Blue 
  Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, a Terminated Medicare Contractor</em>. The 
  purpose of our review was to determine the excess assets that should be remitted 
  to Medicare by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (Michigan) because of 
  the termination of the Medicare contractual relationship in 1994. </p>
<p>We determined that as of January 1995, Michigan had excess Medicare pension 
  assets of almost $12 million. Regulations and the Medicare contracts provide 
  that pension gains which occur when the Medicare contract terminates should 
  be credited to the Medicare program. Accordingly, we are recommending that Michigan 
  remit almost $12 million in excess pension assets to the Medicare program. </p>
<p>Michigan disagreed with our recommendation because they believed the calculations 
  should have considered future benefits and a lower retirement age. Our calculations 
  were based on applicable regulations and estimates used by Michigan's actuaries 
  to fund the pension plan. The Health Care Financing Administration, Office of 
  the Actuary, reviewed our report, including Michigan's comments, and agreed 
  with our analysis and resultant recommendation. </p>
