<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments according
  to Federal regulations.&nbsp; We found that the State agency's policies and procedures were not sufficient to ensure the
  timely reporting of all overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency delayed returning the Federal share of identified
  overpayments totaling $211,667.&nbsp; Of that amount, the State agency had not yet reported or returned $97,938 to the
  Federal government as of February 12, 2004.&nbsp; We recommended that the State Agency ensure that the Federal share of
  overpayments totaling $97,938 is returned to the Federal government as soon as possible and strengthen policies and procedures
  to ensure all overpayments are reported in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agency generally concurred
  with our findings and recommendations and initiated actions to address those issues.</p>
