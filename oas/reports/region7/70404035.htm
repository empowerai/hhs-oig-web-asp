<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the fiscal intermediary, TrailBlazer, calculated Medicare outlier
  payments to Foundation in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; TrailBlazer did
  not calculate Medicare outlier payments to Foundation in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements,
  using an incorrect cost-to-charge ratio in computing the outlier payments.&nbsp; As a result, TrailBlazer
  overpaid Foundation approximately $1.4 million.&nbsp; We recommended that TrailBlazer (1) recover from
  Foundation the improper outlier payments and (2) implement internal controls that ensure the correct
  cost-to-charge ratios are used for future outlier payments.&nbsp; TrailBlazer agreed that an error
  was made in determining the cost-to-charge ratio used to compute outlier payments, but disagreed with
  the cost-to-charge ratio we used to compute the overpayment.&nbsp; TrailBlazer also agreed that adequate
  internal controls were not in place to identify and correct the error in determining the cost-to-charge
  ratio for this provider.</p>
