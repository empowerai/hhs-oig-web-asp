<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to: &nbsp;(1) determine if pension costs for the years 1997-2001 were funded in accordance with the
  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and (2) identify and properly account for
  any accumulated unfunded pension costs, including allowable and reassignable portions.&nbsp; We found that Highmark funded
  the pension costs for plan years 1997 through 2001 in accordance with the FAR and the CAS.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, Highmark
  did not identify correctly or account properly for the additional accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; We recommended,
  as of January 1, 2002, Highmark should decrease its accumulated unallowable pension costs by $236,744 ($12,882 for the
  Medicare Part A segment plus $223,862 for the Other segment).&nbsp; Highmark did not concur with the OIG's recommendation
  that it should decrease the accumulated unallowable pension cost by $236,744.</p>
