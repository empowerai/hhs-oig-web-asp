<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out that Nebraska charged unallowable costs to the 
  title IV-E Foster Care program totaling approximately $11.7 million (federal 
  share) for the 5-year period ending September 30, 1999. The unallowable costs 
  consisted of ; salaries and related overhead costs of staff who were not in 
  training, unsupported costs, program costs allocated in error, overhead costs 
  claimed at an unallowable enhanced FFP rate, and costs not allocated to all 
  benefitting programs. We recommended a financial adjustment for $11.7 million, 
  and that Nebraska obtain an agreement with the HHS Division of Cost Allocation 
  for allocating future training costs.</p>
