<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of University Recharge 
  Centers at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa (University). The University 
  generally operated its recharge centers in a satisfactory manner. Based on the 
  recharge centers reviewed, however, we found the need for improved procedures 
  and controls to fully comply with all the requirements of Office of Management 
  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, cost Principles for Educational Institutions. 
  In five recharge centers selected for review, we found: billing rates were not 
  periodically adjusted to achieve break-even (four centers); equipment was improperly 
  expensed in the year purchased (three centers); transfers were improperly made 
  to a capital reserve fund (one center); and, users were billed at different 
  rates (one center). We are recommending that the University implement certain 
  procedures and controls over the operation of recharge centers. </p>
