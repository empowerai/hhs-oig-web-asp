<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Kansas Department of Social 
and Rehabilitation Services (the State agency) did not assure that its 
$61,765,693 ($37,178,661 Federal share) claim for targeted case management (TCM) 
services was equal to or less than the limit specified in the State plan. 
&nbsp;Without such assurance—supported with auditable documentation—we were unable to 
express an opinion on the reasonableness of the State agency’s claim for 
reimbursement on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the 
Medical Assistance Program reports.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) work with CMS to determine the allowability of the $61,765,693 ($37,178,661 Federal share) for the audit period 
of State fiscal years 2001<b> </b>through<b> </b>2003 and all subsequent periods 
and (2) strengthen internal controls to ensure that State plan requirements are 
followed in submitting future TCM claims.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with the 
first recommendation and did not directly address the second recommendation.</p>
