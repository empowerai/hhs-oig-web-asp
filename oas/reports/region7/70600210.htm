<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether postretirement benefit costs claimed for the period subsequent to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island&rsquo;s (Rhode Island) termination were allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp;Rhode Island&rsquo;s entire claim of $3,558,976 in postretirement benefit costs was unallowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp;The claim represented (1) a retroactive change in accounting basis, (2) an immediate recognition of the transition obligation, and (3) a request for reimbursement of unfunded costs.&nbsp;None of these costs are allowable in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); therefore, the costs were unallowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp;We recommended that Rhode Island withdraw its claim of $3,558,976 for postretirement benefit costs. Rhode Island disagreed with our recommendation.</p>
