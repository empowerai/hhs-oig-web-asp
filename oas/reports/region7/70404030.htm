<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the six State agencies in Region VIII (Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana,
  North Dakota, and South Dakota) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over their respective Medicaid
  drug rebate programs. &nbsp;Individual reports were issued to each State agency, and this report summarizes the issues
  identified in those reports. </p>
<p>The State agencies in Utah, Wyoming and Montana had not established adequate accountability and controls over their Medicaid
  drug rebate programs.&nbsp; As a result, there was no assurance that all drug rebates due to those States were collected.&nbsp; North
  Dakota, Colorado and South Dakota had generally established adequate controls and procedures.&nbsp; However, we did make
  specific recommendations regarding their programs to address minor weaknesses.&nbsp; Specific recommendations were made
  to each of the State agencies that addressed the weaknesses described above.&nbsp; All but one of the six State agencies
  generally agreed with our findings and recommendations and indicated that corrective action had been enacted or was planned.&nbsp; Wyoming
  did not concur with our findings.</p>
