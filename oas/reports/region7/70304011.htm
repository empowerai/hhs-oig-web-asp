<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The audit objective was to evaluate whether the Missouri Department of Social
  Services, Division of Medical Services (DMS) had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp;We determined
  the DMS had adequate controls over the drug rebate program as required by federal
  regulations except for the following areas:&nbsp;Form CMS 64.9R and the general
  ledger reconciliation, dispute resolution, and interest accrual and collection.&nbsp; These
  issues occurred because the DMS did not develop or follow adequate policies
  and procedures with regard to the drug rebate program.&nbsp; Federal regulations
  require effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and
  other assets.&nbsp; In addition, the rebate agreements between the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the drug manufacturers require the payment
  of interest on all disputed, late, and unpaid drug rebates, and the use of
  the State hearing mechanism to resolve disputes. Our review showed that drug
  rebate receivables were perpetually understated and it is likely that the DMS
  did not receive all drug rebates and interest on disputed or late rebate payments
  due from manufacturers.&nbsp; In addition, without routine reconciliations,
  the DMS did not have reasonable assurance that the rebate receivables were
  effectively safeguarded.</p>
