<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this report was to assess the impact that 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's (CMS) practice of not retroactively adjusting outpatient outlier payments has on 
the integrity of the outpatient outlier program.&nbsp; In a series of reviews, we 
identified significant outpatient outlier overpayments to community mental 
health centers (CMHC).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CMS’s practice of not retroactively adjusting outpatient 
outlier payments creates significant vulnerabilities in the outpatient outlier 
program.&nbsp; The practice is also inconsistent with CMS’s policy of retroactively 
adjusting inpatient prospective payment system (PPS) outlier payments. &nbsp;Prior 
audits showed that some CMHCs received significant outpatient outlier 
overpayments as a result of fiscal intermediaries’ and CMHCs’ mathematical and 
clerical errors and CMHCs’ manipulation of charge data to their advantage.&nbsp; 
Other CMHCs received underpayments as a result of fiscal intermediaries’ 
errors.&nbsp; Following its current practice, CMS did not adjust these erroneous 
payments, resulting in substantial net losses to the Medicare trust fund and 
payment inequities among CMHCs.&nbsp; CMS’s practice also does not allow for 
retroactive adjustments when a fiscal intermediary’s final cost report 
settlement identifies errors that caused previous erroneous outlier payments.&nbsp; 
Although our work was specific to CMHCs, similar vulnerabilities may exist in 
the entire outpatient outlier program.&nbsp;</p>
<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We 
recommended</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"> 
that CMS issue regulations to require retroactive adjustments of outpatient 
outlier payments within appropriately established thresholds.&nbsp; Specifically, we 
recommend that CMS require (1) adjustments of outpatient outlier payments at 
final cost report settlement, retroactive to the beginning of the cost report 
period, and (2) retroactive adjustments of outpatient outlier payments when an 
error caused by the fiscal intermediary or provider is identified after the cost 
report is settled.&nbsp; In written comments, CMS stated that it would explore the 
feasibility and cost effectiveness of implementing our recommendations.</span>
