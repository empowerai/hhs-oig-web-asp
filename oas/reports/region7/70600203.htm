<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>
<p>Our objectives were to determine if the pension segmentation requirements
  of the Medicare contract were followed while updating the nonqualified defined-benefit plan
  (NQDBP) Medicare segment assets for: (1) Veritus from January 1, 1994, to January 1, 1998,
  (2)&nbsp;Pennsylvania Blue Shield (PBS) from January 1, 1992, to January 1, 1998, and (3)
  Highmark from January 1, 1998, to January 1, 2003.&nbsp; We found that Highmark and its predecessors
  did not fully comply with the Medicare contracts’ pension segmentation requirements while
  updating the NQDBP Medicare segment assets.&nbsp; As a result, Veritus understated the Medicare
  segment assets for the NQDBP by $9,476 as of January 1, 1998.&nbsp; PBS overstated the Medicare
  segment assets for the NQDBP by $46,999 as of January 1, 1998.&nbsp; Highmark understated
  Medicare segment assets for the NQDBP for Medicare Part A by $4,057 and overstated Medicare
  segment assets for Medicare Part B by $50,351 as of January 1, 2003. </p>
<p>We recommended that: (1) Veritus increase
    its NQDBP Medicare segment assets by $9,476, and recognize $13,484 of Medicare segment
    assets as of January 1, 1998; (2) PBS decrease its NQDBP Medicare segment assets by $46,999
    and recognize $367,210 of Medicare segment assets as of January 1, 1998; and (3) &nbsp;Highmark
    increase its NQDBP Medicare Part A segment assets by $4,057, decrease NQDBP Medicare Part
    B segment assets by $50,351, and recognize Medicare segment assets of $227,868 and $409,562,
    respectively, as of January 1, 2003.&nbsp; In comments, Highmark agreed to increase its
    Medicare Part A assets and decrease its Part B segment assets, but stated that is is unnecessary
    to adjust Veritus or PBS Medicare segment assets as of January 1, 1998.&nbsp; We maintain
    that adjustments to Veritus and PBS are necessary.</p>
