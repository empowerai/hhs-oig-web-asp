<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Until its Medicare contracts were terminated in 1999, Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) was allowed to claim reimbursement
  for its Medicare employees' pension costs.&nbsp; According to Federal regulations and the Medicare contracts, pension gains
  that occur when a Medicare segment of a pension plan closes must be credited to the Medicare program.&nbsp; We found that
  Texas BCBS originally identified excess Medicare pension assets of $10,753,575.&nbsp; However, Texas BCBS revised its calculation
  and indicated that the correct figure was $11,152,093.&nbsp; We determined that the revised figure was materially correct
  and recommended that Texas BCBS remit $11,152,093 to the Federal Government for excess Medicare pension assets.</p>
