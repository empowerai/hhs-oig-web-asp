<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this review was to determine whether Kansas calculated the upper payment limit (UPL)
  for non-State government nursing homes in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment.&nbsp; In
  general, Federal funds are not available for Medicaid payments that exceed the UPL.&nbsp; However, during a limited period
  of time, called a transition period, Kansas was eligible to receive Medicaid payments that exceeded the UPL by a determined
  amount.&nbsp; We found that Kansas followed Federal regulations and its State plan amendment when calculating the UPL for
  non-State government nursing homes.&nbsp; Contrary to Federal regulations, however, Kansas increased the Medicaid payment
  amount that exceeded the UPL during its transition period.&nbsp; As a result, Kansas overclaimed expenses by $58,303,091
  ($35,004,284 Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that Kansas reduce claimed expenses on its quarterly expenditure reports
  by $58,303,091 ($35,004,284 Federal share) for the period April 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002.&nbsp; Kansas concurred
  with our recommendation.</p>
