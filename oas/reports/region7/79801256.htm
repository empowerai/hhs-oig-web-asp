<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This review was made to determine whether Medicare managed care risk plans 
  may be selectively enrolling healthier beneficiaries and encouraging sicker 
  beneficiaries to disenroll. Our review of beneficiaries who disenrolled from 
  six managed care firms during 1991 through 1996 found that Medicare paid hospitals 
  $224 million for inpatient services furnished to these beneficiaries within 
  3 months of their disenrollment. Medicare would have paid $20 million in capitation 
  payments to these six firms had these beneficiaries not disenrolled, a difference 
  of $204 million. Moreover, about 18 percent of the expenditures ($41 million) 
  were paid for beneficiaries who reenrolled in Medicare managed care after receiving 
  inpatient care under the Medicare fee-for-service system. Recommendations call 
  for actions the Health Care Financing Administration can begin to take to identify 
  and preclude this inappropriate manipulation of Medicare's health care system.
