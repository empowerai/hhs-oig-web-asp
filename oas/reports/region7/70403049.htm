<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments to the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp;The State agency's policies and procedures
  were not sufficient to ensure the timely reporting of all overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency delayed returning
  the Federal share of identified overpayments totaling $469,756.&nbsp; Of that amount, the State agency had not yet reported
  or returned to the Federal government $334,698 as of February 11, 2004.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency (1)
  ensure that the Federal share of overpayments totaling $334,698 is returned to the Federal government as soon as possible,
  and (2) strengthen policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The
  State agency agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
