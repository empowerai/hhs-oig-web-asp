<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine the allowability of pension costs that Montana claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1990 - 2003.&nbsp;Montana did not claim Medicare pension costs for FYs 1990 - 2003.&nbsp;Allowable Medicare pension costs during this period were $1,849,746.&nbsp;Montana did not claim $1,849,746 of allowable pension costs because it had chosen not to claim pension costs for Medicare reimbursement. </p>
<p>We recommended that Montana revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) to increase claimed pension costs by $1,849,746.&nbsp;We also recommended that Montana claim future pension costs in accordance with Federal requirements and the Medicare contracts.&nbsp;Montana concurred with our recommendations. </p>
