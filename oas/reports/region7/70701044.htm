<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">From January through December 2006, the Missouri Department 
of Social Services did not always make a corresponding contribution payment 
to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) on behalf of Medicaid 
recipients who were also eligible for Medicare (full-duals). &nbsp;Federal regulations require States to make contribution payments to CMS 
to defray a portion of the costs of the Medicare Part D program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our review found that for 98 of 100 statistically sampled 
beneficiary-months, Missouri (1) was not required to make contributions to CMS 
because the beneficiaries were not actually full-duals in the sampled months or 
were not identified in the State’s Medicaid eligibility records or (2) made 
subsequent retroactive contributions to CMS.&nbsp; However, contrary to Federal 
requirements, Missouri did not make contributions to CMS for 2 of the 100 
sampled beneficiary-months.&nbsp; Specifically, the State did not correctly identify 
either of the 2 beneficiaries as a full-dual.&nbsp; As a result of the discrepancies, 
the State did not make $216 in contributions to CMS that it should have made. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Missouri (1) remit $216 to the Federal 
Government on behalf of the two individuals who were not correctly identified as 
full-duals, (2) ensure that required contributions are identified and made for 
all full-duals, and (3) identify and accurately report all full-duals to CMS.&nbsp; 
In written comments on our draft report, the State concurred with all of our 
recommendations.</p>
