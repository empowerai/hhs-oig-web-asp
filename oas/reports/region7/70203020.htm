<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>During a prior audit we determined that the Centers for Medicare 
  &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) had not obtained recipient data from the Social 
  Security Administration (SSA) that identifies incarcerated recipients.&nbsp; 
  As a result, potentially improper Medicare payments were made by CMS.&nbsp;Based 
  on this work, we undertook a review of Medicaid fee-for-service payments for 
  services provided to incarcerated recipients in four states to determine if 
  the Medicaid program had similar vulnerabilities.&nbsp; The state of Missouri 
  was one of the four states selected for review.&nbsp; The CMS guidelines and 
  state Medicaid regulations generally provide that Medicaid will not cover outpatient 
  services or the cost of prescription drugs for inmates.&nbsp; We found that 
  improper Medicaid fee-for-service payments for outpatient services and prescription 
  drugs have been made for incarcerated recipients. However, 
  we did not find enough errors in our sample to make a statistically valid projection 
  of the overpayments to the universe.&nbsp; In our opinion, the claims were paid 
  because the state did not fully utilize the available data from SSA to identify 
  incarcerated recipients.&nbsp; We recommended that the state utilize the data 
  available from the SSA to identify incarcerated recipients to ensure that unallowable 
  payments for services provided to inmates are not made in the future.</p>
