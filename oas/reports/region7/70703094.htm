<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">In a follow-up audit of Iowa’s 
Medicaid drug rebate program, we found that, as of June 30, 2006, the State had
<span style="font-size: 11.5pt">generally corrected the control weaknesses 
identified in our previous audit. &nbsp;However, the State had not developed adequate 
policies and procedures to offer the State’s hearing mechanism for disputes that 
were 60 days old or to ensure that interest collections were properly and 
accurately reported.&nbsp; As a result, the State had not reported interest totaling 
$873 that was collected during our audit period.&nbsp; Finally, the State had 
established controls over and accountability for collecting rebates on 
single-source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; </span>Under the drug rebate 
program, manufacturers receive Federal Medicaid funding for covered outpatient 
drugs by entering into a rebate agreement with CMS and paying quarterly rebates 
to the States.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) develop and follow policies and procedures to 
offer use of the State’s hearing mechanism to resolve disputes after 60 days; 
(2) <span style="font-size:11.5pt">develop and follow policies and procedures to 
properly report interest collections on the Form CMS-64 summary sheet; and (3) 
report interest of $873 that was collected, but not reported, during the audit 
period.&nbsp; The State concurred, either wholly or in part, with all of our findings 
and recommendations.</span></p>
