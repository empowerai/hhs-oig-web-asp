<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p >This final report presents the results of our audit of the cash management
  procedures used by the University of Iowa (University) to control funds paid
  by the Payment Management System (PMS) during the three year period ended June
  30, 2000.&nbsp; We found that the University did not have adequate policies
  and procedures in place to monitor daily cash balances and to precisely calculate
  interest earned on positive daily cash balances.&nbsp; In monitoring the daily
  cash balances, the University did not consider (1) actual dates of electronic
  payments,&nbsp; (2) expenses exceeding authorized grant amounts, (3) year-end
  adjustments,&nbsp; (4) actual dates of deposits, and (5) overhead costs as
  incurred.&nbsp; Also, the University was not able to reconcile cash balances
  used to calculate remitted interest to those amounts reported on the <i>Federal
  Cash Transaction Reports.</i>&nbsp; We determined that the amount of interest
  remitted by the University for the Department of Health and Human Services
  (DHHS) funds was less than the amount of interest that should have been remitted
  if appropriate procedures had been used.&nbsp; Although the difference between
  the amount of interest remitted and our estimates was not significant, we have
  concerns that the deficiencies we noted could cause future interest remittances
  to be inaccurate. </p>
