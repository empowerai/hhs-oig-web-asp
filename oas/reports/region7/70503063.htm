<p>Our objective was to determine whether the State agency claimed mental health center (MHC)
  Medicaid administrative costs for the quarters that ended December 31, 2002, and March 31,
  2003, in accordance with applicable Federal requirements. We found that the State agency
  did not claim MHCs Medicaid administrative costs in accordance with applicable Federal requirements.
  Specifically, (1) the State agency used a statistically invalid random moment time study
  to allocate costs because it had inadequate oversight and the system did not have adequate
  capacity to process all of the time studies; (2) the State agency inappropriately claimed
  75 percent Federal reimbursement instead of 50 percent for activities that did not require
  skilled professional medical personnel expertise because of a weakness in the claim calculator;
  (3) the State agency's claim for the quarter that ended March 31, 2003, was calculated by
  MAXIMUS with transposed time study percentages because the State agency had inadequate oversight
  to ensure claimed amounts were accurate; and (4) the State agency included improper amounts
  reported by some of the MHCs because it had inadequate oversight and did not adequately train
  staff at the MHCs. We recommended that the State agency work with CMS to resolve the $3,060,098
  in Federal reimbursement that we set aside. The State agency concurred with the findings
  and the recommendation. </p>
