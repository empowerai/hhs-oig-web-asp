<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The audit objective was to evaluate whether the Utah Department
  of Health, Division of Health Care Financing (DHCF), had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found that
  the DHCF lacked sufficient internal controls with regard to the Medicaid drug rebate
  program as required by federal rules and regulations. &nbsp;As a result, drug rebate
  receivables were perpetually understated and it is likely that the DHCF did not
  receive all drug rebates and interest on disputed or late rebate payments due from
  manufacturers.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of sufficient internal controls increased
  the risk for fraud, waste, or abuse of drug rebate program funds.</p>
