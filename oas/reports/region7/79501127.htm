<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final audit report provides the results of our review to determine the 
  accuracy of base year estimates used by the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA) to calculate prospective rates for capital expenditures paid to hospitals. 
  Although HCFA used the best data available at the time, current actual cost 
  experience indicates HCFA's forecast estimates for base year 1992 costs were 
  too high. Higher estimates will result in excessive payments to hospitals. By 
  adjusting the estimates to reflect more current data, HCFA would reduce payment 
  rates for capital related expenditures by about 7.5 percent. In order to prevent 
  overpaying hospitals in the future for capital costs, we are recommending that 
  HCFA adjust rates to reflect more current cost data. We are also recommending 
  that HCFA continue to monitor the most current data (i.e., settling of unsettled 
  cost reports for the remaining 36 percent of hospitals) and make any necessary 
  further adjustments to the base rate. The HCFA concurred with our analysis, 
  but did not comment on our specific recommendations. </p>
