<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report determined that the State claimed direct maintenance costs 
  for children who were identified as eligible for foster care, but exceeded the 
  age limit for eligibility (age 18). As a result we determined that as much as 
  $68,293 in direct maintenance costs could be unallowable. We are recommending 
  that the State (1) refund maintenance costs for the ineligible 19 year old children 
  and the 18 year old children who had graduated from school and (2) determine 
  if the remaining 18 year olds were full-time students, refunding costs for any 
  who were ineligible. We are also recommending that the State establish computer 
  edits that would prevent payments for children exceeding the age limits. </p>
