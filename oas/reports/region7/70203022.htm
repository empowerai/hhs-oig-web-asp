<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to evaluate Wellmark, Inc.'s (Wellmark) compliance 
  with the pension segmentation requirements of its Medicare contract and to determine 
  the excess assets that should be remitted to Medicare as a result of the termination 
  of the Medicare contractual relationship effective May 31, 2000.&nbsp; Wellmark 
  was a Medicare contractor until its contract was terminated in 2000 and, as 
  such, was allowed to claim reimbursement for its Medicare employees' pension 
  costs.&nbsp; Federal regulations and the Medicare contracts provide, however, 
  that pension gains, which occur when a Medicare segment of a pension plan closes, 
  be credited to the Medicare program.&nbsp; Accordingly, we recommended that 
  Wellmark remit $1,353,036 in excessive pension assets to the Medicare program.</p>
