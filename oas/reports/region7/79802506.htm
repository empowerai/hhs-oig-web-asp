<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Unfunded Pension Costs 
  of Aetna Life and Casualty Company (Aetna). During our previous review of Aetna 
  (CIN A-07-93-00679), we determined that the Medicare segment accumulated $4,455,857 
  in unfunded pension costs as of January 1, 1991. We recommended that Aetna identify 
  those unfunded pension costs as an unallowable component of subsequent years' 
  pension cost calculations. We also recommended that Aetna update the accumulated 
  unfunded pension costs, and identify and track similar costs occurring in later 
  years. </p>
<p>Our current review showed that Aetna did identify and update the accumulated 
  unfunded pension costs from 1991 through 1995. Additionally, Aetna identified 
  and tracked additional unfunded pension costs for years 1991 through 1995. However, 
  we determined that Aetna understated its accumulated unfunded pension costs 
  by $1,407,689 as of January 1, 1996. The understatement occurred because Aetna 
  incorrectly began amortizing the accumulated unfunded costs as a component of 
  the Medicare segment's pension costs in 1995. </p>
<p>We recommend that Aetna increase the January 1, 1996 accumulated unfunded pension 
  costs of the Medicare segment by $1,407,689. We also recommended that Aetna 
  obtain approval of its contracting officer before including any portion of the 
  accumulated unfunded costs as a component of the Medicare segment's pension 
  costs. </p>
