<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Nebraska’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that the State had not corrected all of the weaknesses 
identified in our previous audit. &nbsp;Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs 
eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering into a rebate agreement with 
CMS and paying quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp; The State had corrected the 
previously reported weakness in its dispute resolution hearing mechanism. 
&nbsp;However, the State had not (1) developed a subsidiary accounts receivable 
system that detailed all drug rebate transactions, including adjustments; (2) 
reconciled the general ledger to the subsidiary accounts and to the Form 
CMS-64.9R; (3) reconciled the quarterly cash receipts log to the Form CMS-64.9R; 
(4) estimated and accrued interest on all overdue rebate balances; or (5) 
reported interest received on the Form CMS-64 Summary Sheet instead of as a 
rebate receivable. &nbsp;Additionally, the State agency did not establish controls 
over and accountability for collecting rebates on single-source drugs 
administered by physicians.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency develop and follow policies and procedures 
that include (1) ensuring that all adjustments are traceable to the subsidiary 
accounts receivable system, (2) reconciling the general ledger account to the 
subsidiary accounts and to the Form CMS-64.9R using actual adjustments supported 
in the system, (3) documenting procedures for reconciling the quarterly cash 
receipts log to the Form CMS-64.9R, (4) estimating and accruing interest on all 
overdue rebate balances, and (5) reporting interest received on the Form CMS-64 
Summary Sheet instead of as a rebate receivable.&nbsp; We also recommended that the 
State begin collecting drug rebates on single-source drugs administered by 
physicians.&nbsp; The State agreed with all of our findings and recommendations 
except for the finding and recommendation regarding the reconciliation of the 
general ledger to subsidiary accounts and to Form CMS-64.9R.</p>
