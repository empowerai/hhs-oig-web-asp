<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p >This final report presents the results of our audit of the cash management procedures
  used by Washington University in St. Louis (University) to control the funds paid
  by the Payment Management System (PMS) during the three years ended June 30, 2000.&nbsp; We
  found that the University did not have adequate policies and procedures in place
  to monitor daily cash balances and to precisely calculate interest earned on positive
  daily cash balances.&nbsp; In monitoring the daily cash balances, the University
  did not consider <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) outstanding checks
  and&nbsp; (2) overhead costs as incurred.&nbsp; In addition, the University did
  not use the appropriate interest rates when calculating the interest remitted to
  the Federal Government.&nbsp; </span>We determined that the amount of excess interest
  remitted by the University was comparable to the amount of interest that should
  have been remitted if appropriate procedures had been used.&nbsp; We believe that
  this occurrence was a coincidence due to off setting factors in the University&#146;s
  calculation of the amount to be remitted.&nbsp; We are recommending that the University
  revise its written policies and procedures to effectively monitor the daily cash
  balance and to accurately compute the Federal remittance. </p>
