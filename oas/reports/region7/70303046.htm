<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Texas administered Medicare Part A and Part B operations under cost reimbursement contracts with the
  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from the start of the Medicare program until the contractual relationship was
  terminated effective September 30, 1999.&nbsp; The objectives of the audit were to determine whether (1) claimed allowable
  pension costs for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal year (FY) 1999 and (2) implemented a prior audit recommendation pertaining
  to FY 1994.&nbsp; Texas allocated total company CAS pension costs to Medicare for FYs 1995-99.&nbsp; Separately calculated
  Medicare segment pension costs were materially lower than the claimed allocated pension costs for this same period.&nbsp; The
  Medicare contract required that pension costs for a Medicare segment be separately calculated when such calculation materially
  affected the pension costs allocated to the Medicare segment.&nbsp; Because Texas did not separately calculate costs, it
  overclaimed $2,149,372 in&nbsp; pension costs on its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) for FYs 1995-99.&nbsp; Also,
  Texas did not implement a prior audit recommendation to adjust pension costs on its FY 1994 FACP.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Texas remit $3,023,483 ($2,149,372 for FYs 1995-99 and $874,111 for FY 1994) to the Federal Government for the unallowable
  pension costs claimed on its FACPs as of FY 1999.</p>
