<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Blue Cross Blue Shield of
  Connecticut was a Medicare contractor until its contract was terminated in
  1999 and, as such, was allowed to claim reimbursement for its Medicare employees'
  pension costs.&nbsp; Federal regulations and the Medicare contracts provide,
  however, that pension gains which occur when a Medicare segment of a pension
  plan closes, be credited to the Medicare program.&nbsp; Accordingly, we recommended
  that Connecticut remit $1,351,284 in excess pension assets to the Medicare
  program.&nbsp; Connecticut agreed with our recommendation.</p>
