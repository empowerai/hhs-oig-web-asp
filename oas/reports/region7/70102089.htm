<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this review
    was to verify that disproportionate share hospital (DSH) amounts claimed
    by Missouri for State Fiscal Year ended June 30, 1999 were calculated in
    accordance with the approved Medicaid State plan.&nbsp; The report pointed
    out that DSH costs claimed on behalf of State mental hospitals were overstated
    due to a clerical error. A simple calculation error occurred while compiling
    DSH costs resulting in a $1.3 million Federal financial participation (FFP)
    overstatement.&nbsp; We recommended that the State return $1.3 million to
    the Federal Government; review other years for similar errors and return
    any overpayments; and implement controls to ensure such calculation errors
    do not occur in the future. The State concurred with our finding that there
was a  $ 1.3 million FFP overpayment but did not respond to the remaining recommendations.</p>
