<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Our objective was to 
determine whether the Iowa </span>Department of Human Services’s (the
<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">State agency) claims for reimbursement of 
Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures complied with Federal requirements.<br>
<br>
Not all of the State agency’s claims for reimbursement of Medicaid outpatient 
drug expenditures complied with Federal requirements.&nbsp; Of the </span>$709 
million ($466<span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> </span>million Federal share) 
in Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures that the State agency claimed for 
fiscal years 2003 and 2004, $154,245 (<span style="layout-grid-mode:
line">Federal share) represented expenditures for drug products that were</span> 
not eligible for Medicaid coverage because they were terminated drugs.&nbsp; An 
additional $1,079,386 (Federal share) represented expenditures for drug products 
that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund $154,245 to the Federal 
Government <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">for drug expenditures that were 
not eligible for Medicaid coverage; (2) work with CMS to resolve </span>
$1,079,386<span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> in payments for drugs that were 
not listed on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have been eligible for 
Medicaid coverage; and (3) </span>strengthen internal controls to ensure that 
claimed Medicaid drug expenditures comply with Federal requirements, 
specifically by claiming expenditures only for drugs that are dispensed before 
the termination dates listed on the quarterly drug tapes and verifying whether 
drugs not listed on the quarterly drug tapes are covered under the Medicaid 
program and notify CMS when drugs are missing from the tapes. &nbsp;The State agency 
partly agreed and partly disagreed with our recommendations.</p>
