<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report points out potential Medicare overpayments totaling approximately 
  $2.8 million were paid to rural health clinics (RHC) in 13 States for Calendar 
  Years 1997 through 1999. The potential improper payments were composed of $2.6 
  million in Part B billings for individual services that were covered and paid 
  on the basis of an all-inclusive rate per visit, and $0.2 million in duplicate 
  RHC claims for services provided to the same beneficiaries, for the same dates 
  of service, and with the same diagnoses. In addition to financial adjustments, 
  we are recommending that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
  design and implement Common Working File edits to detect claims which contain 
  Part B services that were paid under the all-inclusive rate. We are also recommending 
  that CMS require the fiscal intermediaries to develop effective procedures and 
  computer system edits to detect the submission of duplicate RHC claims. &nbsp; 
  The CMS agreed with all of our recommendations except for designing and implementing 
  CWF edits. The CMS believed that this recommendation would result in additional 
  administrative burdens. However, we believe that CWF edits would be the most 
  effective way to correct problems found during the audit, without placing additional 
  administrative burdens on RHCs.</p>
