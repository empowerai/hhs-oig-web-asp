<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether:&nbsp; (1) Butler County Health Care Center's (BCHCC) policies
  and procedures reflected Medicare cardiac rehabilitation coverage requirements for direct physician supervision, “incident
  to” services, and Medicare covered diagnoses; and (2) &nbsp;payments to BCHCC for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services
  provided to Medicare beneficiaries during Calendar Year 2001 were for Medicare covered diagnoses, were supported by adequate
  documentation, and were otherwise allowable for reimbursement.&nbsp; BCHCC
  did not designate a physician to directly supervise the services provided by its cardiac rehabilitation staff.&nbsp; In
  addition, we could not identify the physician professional services to which the cardiac rehabilitation services were provided “incident
  to.”</p>
