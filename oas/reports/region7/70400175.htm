<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine if the pension costs Veritus allocated to the Medicare contracts for plan
  years 1993-1996 were funded in accordance with Federal requirements, and to identify and properly account for any additional
  accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; Veritus funded the pension costs allocable to the Medicare contracts for plan
  years 1993-1996 in accordance with requirements.&nbsp; However, Veritus did not correctly identify nor properly account
  for its accumulated unfunded pension costs.&nbsp; Thus, Veritus overstated its accumulated unfunded pension costs by $157,447
  and its accumulated reassignable costs by $108,605 as of December 31, 1996.&nbsp; We recommended Veritus should decrease
  its accumulated unallowable unfunded costs by $157,447 and its accumulated reassignable pension costs of the Medicare segment
  by $108,605 as of December 31, 1996.&nbsp; Veritus agreed with our recommendations.</p>
