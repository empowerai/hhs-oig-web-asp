<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Our objective was to determine 
whether the State agency appropriately recognized and reported program income 
for undistributable child support collections and interest earned on child 
support collections.&nbsp; The State agency did not recognize and report program 
income for undistributable child support collections because the State agency 
did not follow its own policies and procedures.&nbsp; As a result, for the period 
October 1, 1998, through September 30, 2005, the State agency did not recognize 
and report program income totaling an estimated $8,336 ($5,502 Federal share).&nbsp; 
In addition, two county offices either transferred or held $129,807 of 
undistributable child support collections, which the State agency claimed were 
not Title IV-D. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) report $8,336 
($5,502 Federal share) of Title IV-D program income after it transfers these 
collections to the State’s abandoned collections account, or revise its 
quarterly Federal financial reports (Form OCSE-34A) to correct these 
transactions; (2) work with the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to 
negotiate the Federal share of the $129,807 in undistributable child support 
collections that may be attributable to Title IV-D and report the negotiated 
amount (if any) on the Form OCSE-396A; (3) work with OCSE to review 
undistributable child support collections for the remaining county offices and 
determine whether they have appropriately declared, transferred, and reported 
any remaining collections as program income; and (4) strengthen enforcement of, 
and training in, policies and procedures to ensure that undistributable child 
support collections are recognized and properly reported as program income.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency disagreed with most of our findings and 
recommendations.&nbsp; After reviewing the State agency’s comments, we adjusted our 
findings and recommendations.</p>
