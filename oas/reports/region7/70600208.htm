<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine the allowability of pension costs that Arkansas claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1997 through 1998.&nbsp;Arkansas claimed $126,636 of unallowable Medicare pension costs for FYs 1997 through 1998 primarily because of the use of the Financial Accounting Standard No. 87 expense for the calculation of the &quot;Other&quot; segment allowable pension costs. Arkansas claimed $2,454,110 of pension costs for Medicare reimbursement; however, we calculated the allowable Medicare pension costs during this period to be $2,327,474.&nbsp;We recommended that Arkansas revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals for FYs 1997 through 1998 to reduce its claimed pension costs by $126,636.&nbsp;Arkansas agreed with our recommendation.</p>
