<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Heartland AIDS 
  Resource Council (HARC) implemented its Ryan White program activities and claimed 
  costs in accordance with Federal guidelines during the three fiscal years ended 
  February 28, 2001.&nbsp; We 
  found that HARC overstated the number of benefiting clients by up to 400 percent 
  during the audit period.&nbsp; By over reporting the total clients benefiting 
  from the program, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and 
  ultimately Congress based its funding decisions on inaccurate data.&nbsp; Overall, 
  we found HARC’s expenditures were appropriate, with the exception of $15,000 
  of reimbursement that could not be justified by expenses recorded in the accounting 
  records.&nbsp; We are recommending that HARC (1) establish procedures to accurately account 
  for and report the actual number of unduplicated clients served, (2) reimburse 
  the Federal Government $15,000, and (3) strengthen controls to ensure expenditures 
  submitted for reimbursement are supported in its accounting system.&nbsp; The 
  HARC concurred with all of our findings and recommendations.</p>
