<h1><a name="begin_content"></a>Review of Nebraska Medicare Part D Contributions to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for "Full-Duals"</h1>

<h2>August 08, 2008 | Audit A-07-07-01040</h2>


<h3 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>From January through October 2006, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (Nebraska) did not always make a corresponding contribution payment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on behalf of Medicaid recipients who were also eligible for Medicare (full-duals).  Federal regulations require States to make contribution payments to CMS in order to defray a portion of the costs of the Medicare Part D program.</p>
<p>Our review found that for the 300 statistically sampled beneficiary-months, Nebraska (1) was not required to make contributions to CMS because the beneficiaries were not actually full-duals in the sampled months or were not identified in the State's Medicaid eligibility records or (2) made subsequent retroactive contributions to CMS.  Our report made no recommendations.</p>
