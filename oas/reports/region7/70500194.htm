<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed by Athem Health Plans of Maine, Inc. for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 2001 through 2002. &nbsp;We found that Maine claimed unallowable Medicare pension costs for FYs 2001 through 2002.&nbsp; During this period, the allowable Medicare pension costs were $20,800.&nbsp; However, Maine claimed pension costs of $183,907 for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; Maine claimed $163,107 of unallowable pension costs because it did not claim pension costs in accordance with its Medicare contract.</p>
<p>We recommended that Maine:&nbsp; (1) revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals for FYs 2001 through 2002 to reduce its claimed pension costs by $163,107 and (2) claim future pension costs in accordance with the Medicare contract.&nbsp; Anthem agreed with our report finding.&nbsp; Anthem also provided information that we used to clarify the report background.</p>
