Results of Limited Scope Review of Peak Vista Community Health Centers</h2>

<h2 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>


<p>We reviewed the financial condition of Peak Vista Community Health Centers (Peak Vista) as part of a nationwide series of reviews of community health centers that have received funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).</p>
<p>Based on our assessment, we believe Peak Vista is financially viable, has the capacity to manage and account for Federal funds, and is capable of operating its health center in accordance with Federal regulations.  However, we identified several weaknesses in Peak Vista's financial management:  new access points funds used for services at unauthorized service sites, funds drawdowns not matching financial system information, payroll costs based on estimates, inadequate segregation of Recovery Act funds in the accounting system; lack of required supporting documentation for salaries, lack of existing formal policies and procedures, and lack of required personnel data.</p>
<p>When monitoring the Recovery Act funds, we recommended that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) consider the information presented in this report in assessing Peak Vista's ability to account for and manage Federal funds and to operate a community health center in accordance with Federal regulations.  In written comments on our draft report, Peak Vista disagreed with the majority of our findings.  Peak Vista provided information as to corrective actions and improvements that it has implemented or is undertaking.  We did not verify the validity of the additional information that Peak Vista provided.  Accordingly, we continue to recommend that HRSA consider the information presented in this report, including Peak Vista's comments, in monitoring the Recovery Act funds. </p>
