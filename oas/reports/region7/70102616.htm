<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>This final report points out that Mutual of Omaha did not always properly quantify
  periodic interim payments (PIP) to hospital providers in final cost report settlements.
  As a result, Mutual of Omaha overpaid five of the eight hospitals included in our
  review a total of $636,867. The overpayments resulted from the omission of certain
  payments (outlier payments) from the worksheet used to determine final payments
  due a provider. As a result of our work Mutual performed a comprehensive review
  of settled cost reports for other PIP providers and found that total overpayments
  were about $10.8 million. Further, this may be occurring at other fiscal intermediaries
  involving about 1000 hospitals nationwide that receive periodic interim payments.
  In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended that the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services (CMS) direct Mutual of Omaha to implement procedures to ensure
  that future cost report settlements include the proper calculation of interim payments.
  We also recommended that CMS work with the Office of Inspector General to determine
  whether interim payments made to hospitals at other fiscal intermediaries were
  calculated correctly at final settlement. The CMS concurred with our recommendations
  and is monitoring Mutual&#146;s collection of the overpayments.</p>
