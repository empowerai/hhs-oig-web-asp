<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether, for the period July 1, 2002, through September 30, 2005, Utah claimed administrative costs for its non&#8209;risk managed care contracts pursuant to Federal regulations.&nbsp;Utah claimed some administrative costs for its non&#8209;risk managed care contracts that were not in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp;Specifically, Utah incorrectly claimed administrative costs at the medical rates (between 70 and 74.19 percent) instead of at the 50-percent administrative rate.&nbsp;For July 2002 through September 2005, Utah reported $31.0 million of administrative costs, for which it claimed $22.7 million in Federal reimbursement, at medical rates rather than at administrative rates. Prior to our audit, Utah recognized that its initial claim was incorrect.&nbsp;Accordingly, it attempted to adjust and lower its claim of the Federal share to the 50-percent administrative rate, which reduced its reimbursement from $22.7 million to $15.5 million.&nbsp;However, our review indicated that Utah did not identify all of the overpayments before making that adjustment.</p>
<p>We recommended that Utah:&nbsp;(1) refund $625,489 to the Federal Government and (2) develop adequate policies and procedures to ensure that future claims for administrative costs for non-risk managed care contracts comply fully with Federal regulations.&nbsp;Utah concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
