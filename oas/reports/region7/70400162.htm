<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> The objective of this review was to determine the allowability of $2,074,473 in post retirement benefit (PRB) costs claimed
  for Medicare reimbursement by North Carolina.&nbsp; The $2,074,473 represents PRB costs that will be incurred subsequent
  to the termination of North Carolina’s Medicare contract.&nbsp; The review showed North Carolina’s claim for $2,074,473
  of PRB costs is unallowable for Medicare reimbursement because the claim represented a retroactive change in accounting
  basis and a request for reimbursement of unfunded costs.&nbsp; We recommended North Carolina withdraw its claim for $2,074,473
  of unallowable PRB costs. </p>
