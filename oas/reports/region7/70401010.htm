<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if Oxford’s claims with 10-12 therapy visits complied with
  Federal regulations and guidance.&nbsp; <a>We found that </a> Oxford’s claims with 10-12
  therapy visits did not always comply with Federal regulations and guidance.&nbsp; Of 100
  statistically sampled claims reviewed by medical professionals, 50 claims had errors (6 claims
  had 2 errors) that caused the Medicare payment amounts to be incorrect.&nbsp; Oxford had
  inadequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that the claims were for medically necessary
  services and properly authorized therapy services, and that it correctly assessed the beneficiary’s
  health status.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that $685,406, of the $3,021,489 that Oxford
  received for the 851 therapy claims, is unallowable.&nbsp; We recommended that Oxford:&nbsp; (1)
  refund $685,406 to the Medicare program;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp; identify and submit adjusted home
  health claims for Medicare overpayments received subsequent to our audit period; and (3)
  strengthen controls to ensure that all claims are for medically necessary services and properly
  authorized therapy services, and that it correctly assesses the beneficiary’s health status.</p>
<p>In its response, Oxford disagreed with many of the medical review determinations and with
  the recommended amount.&nbsp; However, Oxford agreed to strengthen its control processes.</p>
