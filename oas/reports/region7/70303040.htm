<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p> Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas was a Medicare contractor until its contract was terminated in 1999
  and, as such, was allowed to claim reimbursement for its Medicare employees' pension costs.&nbsp; Our audit objective was
  to determine whether $6,000,000 for postretirement benefit (PRB) costs claimed in the period subsequent to the contract's
  termination were allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; We determined that, contrary to requirements, the PRB claim
  represented (1) an unauthorized retroactive change in accounting practice, (2) an immediate recognition of the transition
  obligation, and (3) a request for reimbursement for deposits made to a revocable trust fund.&nbsp; Therefore, we recommended
  that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas withdraw its claims for the $6,000,000.</p>
