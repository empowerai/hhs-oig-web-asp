<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of pension costs that South Carolina claimed for Medicare reimbursement
  for fiscal years (FY) 1994 through 2002.&nbsp; We found that South Carolina underclaimed $366,306 in Medicare pension costs
  for FYs 1994 through 2002 because it did not identify its Medicare segments in accordance with its Medicare contract and
  did not update its Medicare segment assets in accordance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) 412 and 413.&nbsp; South
  Carolina claimed pension costs of $24,460,796 for Medicare reimbursement; however, the allowable Medicare pension costs
  were $24,827,142.&nbsp; We recommend that South Carolina revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) for FYs
  1994 through 2002 to claim additional CAS pension costs of $366,306.&nbsp; Additionally, South Carolina should implement
  procedures to (1) ensure that its Medicare segments are identified in accordance with the Medicare contract and (2) update
  its Medicare segment assets in accordance with CAS 412 and 413.&nbsp; South Carolina disagreed with the draft report finding
  and recommendation because the CAS allowable pension costs were determined by prorating the calendar year CAS allowable
  amounts to arrive at the fiscal year amount.&nbsp; South Carolina stated that the previous pension review did not reflect
  this adjustment and its method of applying the CAS amount has been consistently applied.</p>
