<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report discusses the allowability of training costs claimed by the 
  Missouri Department of Social Services (State) under Department of Health and 
  Human Services (HHS) programs. This review covered the period July 1, 1991 through 
  June 30, 1994. Generally, we found that costs for training were allowable as 
  claimed. However, with respect to training for title IV-E Foster Care, the State 
  claimed excess reimbursement totaling $217,408. The State did not allocate all 
  of the direct foster care costs to the benefitting State foster care program. 
  In addition, we found that Missouri's approved Cost Allocation Plan (i) included 
  a sampling methodology that allocated costs only to foster care when in fact 
  the costs benefitted several program and (ii) allowed indirect costs to be claimed 
  at 75 percent FFP that were only allowable for 50 percent FFP. We recommended 
  that the State refund unallowable costs and establish procedures to ensure only 
  allowable costs are claimed at the enhanced FFP rate. </p>
