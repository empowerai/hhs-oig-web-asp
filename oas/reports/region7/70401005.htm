<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine if Colorado claimed Medicaid family planning costs under
  managed care in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.&nbsp; We
  found that Colorado did not claim Medicaid family planning costs under managed care in accordance with Federal laws and
  regulations.&nbsp; As a result, for the period October 1999 through December 2003, Colorado received $1,587,305 of net
  overpayments that did not qualify for Federal Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp;  <A>We recommended that Colorado:&nbsp; (1)
  refund $1,587,305 of net overpayments, (2) ensure family planning costs are supported by accurate and reliable information,
  and (3) verify the accuracy of family planning claims submitted for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp;  Colorado
  agreed with our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; We commend Colorado for taking steps to develop a more reliable method
  for identifying family planning services and claiming family planning costs.</p>
