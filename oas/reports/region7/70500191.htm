<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine if Premera complied with the Medicare contract’s pension
  segmentation requirements:&nbsp; (1) while updating Medicare segment assets from January
  1, 1995, to December 31, 2004, and (2) in determining Medicare’s share of excess liabilities
  as a result of the termination of the Medicare contract.<a> We found that </a> Premera did
  not comply with the Medicare contract’s pension segmentation requirements while updating
  the Medicare segment’s assets from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2004.&nbsp; As a result,
  Premera understated the Medicare segment assets by $481,681.&nbsp; The understatement occurred
  primarily because Premera did not allocate net investment earnings to the Medicare segment
  in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards requirements.</p>
<p>We recommended that Premera decrease Medicare’s portion of the Medicare segment’s excess
  pension liabilities by $856,522, and therefore recognize $190,637 as Medicare’s portion.&nbsp; Premera
  partially concurred with our findings.&nbsp; Premera did not agree that the segment’s accrued
  benefit liability was overstated by $369,752.</p>
