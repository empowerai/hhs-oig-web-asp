<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA) paid $3.1 million to health maintenance organizations (HMO) for beneficiaries 
  who were deceased. Although HCFA had recouped $1.2 million of the improper payments, 
  $1.9 million remains outstanding due to both HCFA not being aware of all the 
  deaths and its lack of action to collect some identified overpayments. We recommended 
  that HCFA recover the $1.9 million erroneously paid and make immediate system 
  corrections to prevent continuing annual overpayments of $250,000 to HMOs for 
  the identified deceased beneficiaries. The HCFA generally concurred with our 
  recommendations. After issuance of our draft report to HCFA, we continued work 
  in this area and identified an additional $1.1 million in payments for beneficiaries 
  who died subsequent to the cut-off date of our initial review. We are recommending 
  that HCFA also take action to recover these additional overpayments. </p>
