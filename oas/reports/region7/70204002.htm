<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service 
  claims were: furnished by certified Medicare providers to eligible beneficiaries; 
  reimbursed by Medicare contractors in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations; 
  and medically necessary, accurately coded, and sufficiently documented in the 
  beneficiaries’ medical records.&nbsp; The period of this audit was the quarter 
  of January 2002 through March 2002.&nbsp; Our review of 151 claims totaling 
  $530,367 of Medicare payments disclosed that 25 claims did not comply with Medicare 
  laws and regulations.&nbsp; The 25 claims had 133 line errors representing $12,070 
  in improper payments and one underpayment of $7,016.&nbsp; All of these improper 
  payments were detected by medical reviews coordinated by the Office of Inspector 
  General.</p>
