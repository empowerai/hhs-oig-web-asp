<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of our review was to determine whether the 
Missouri Department of Social Services (the State agency) made payments on behalf of beneficiaries who should not 
have been Medicaid-eligible due to their eligibility in Kansas.&nbsp; For the period 
of July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, we estimate that the State agency paid 
$82,602 ($50,994 Federal share) on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have 
been eligible due to their Medicaid eligibility in Kansas.&nbsp; We attribute the 
Medicaid payments made on behalf of beneficiaries who were not eligible in 
Missouri to the insufficient sharing of eligibility data between the State 
agency and Kansas’s Medicaid agency.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommend that the State agency work 
with the Kansas Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid eligibility 
information for use in (1) determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status 
and (2) reducing the amount of payments, estimated to be $82,602 ($50,994 Federal 
share), made on behalf of beneficiaries residing in Kansas. &nbsp;The State agency 
concurred with our first recommendation but not our second recommendation.</p>
