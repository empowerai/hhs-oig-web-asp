<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of pension costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement for FY 1998 through
  2002. &nbsp;We found that Highmark underclaimed $1,637,414 in allowable Medicare pension costs for FY 1998 through 2002
  because it did not identify its Medicare segments in accordance with its Medicare contract and did not update its Medicare
  segment assets in accordance with CAS 412 and CAS 413.&nbsp; Highmark claimed pension costs of $4,813,234 for Medicare
  reimbursement; however, the allowable Medicare pension costs were $6,450,648.&nbsp; We recommend that Highmark: (1) revise
  its Final Administrative Cost Proposals (FACP) to claim allowable CAS pension costs of $1,637,414 for FY 1998 through 2002
  and (2) implement controls to ensure that the Medicare segments are identified in accordance with the Medicare contract
  and updated in accordance with CAS 412 and 413. &nbsp;Highmark disagreed with our report and contends that: (1) the Office
  of Inspector General (OIG) assigned certain participants to incorrect segments, (2) OIG identified the incorrect amount
  of cost claimed on the Final Administrative Cost Proposal (FACP) by Highmark,and (3) most of OIG’s findings concerning
  the understatement of Medicare Part B segment assets were due to a retroactive application of a recent decision handed
  down by the U.S. Court of Appeals concerning reassignable pension costs.</p>
