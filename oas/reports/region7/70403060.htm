<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if the State agency reported Medicaid provider overpayments according to
  Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agency did not report all Medicaid provider overpayments in accordance with Federal
  regulations and its policies and procedures were not sufficient to ensure the timely reporting of all overpayments.&nbsp; As
  a result, the State agency delayed returning overpayments totaling $2,395,384 ($1,478,950 Federal share).&nbsp; Of that
  amount, the State agency has not yet reported or returned to the Federal Government overpayments totaling $858,669 ($537,210
  Federal share).&nbsp; <a>We recommended t</a>he State agency should return the Federal share of overpayments totaling $537,210
  to the Federal Government as soon as possible and strengthen policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported
  in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
