<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: &nbsp;</P>

<p>Our objective was to determine whether North Dakota reported Medicaid 
provider overpayments pursuant to Federal regulations. North Dakota did not 
report all Medicaid provider overpayments pursuant to Federal regulations. 
Specifically, as of March 31, 2005, it had not reported 132 Medicaid 
overpayments. The Federal share of the 132 unreported overpayments totaled 
$684,025. North Dakota did not report overpayments on time because its policies 
and procedures were insufficient to ensure timely reporting of all overpayments. 
Specifically, it waited to report provider overpayments until it had (1) 
collected them from the provider or (2) finalized the cost report settlement.</p>
<p>We recommended that North Dakota return the Federal share of identified 
Medicaid overpayments totaling $684,025 to the Federal Government and improve 
its policies and procedures to ensure all overpayments are reported pursuant to 
Federal requirements. The State agency generally concurred with our findings and 
recommendations. </p>
