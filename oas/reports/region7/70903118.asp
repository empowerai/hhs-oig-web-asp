Administration for Children and Families Resolution of Audit Recommendations</h2>

<h2 class="line">Executive Summary</h2>


<p>We found that during fiscal years 2006 through 2008, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) resolved 10,979 of the 14,180 audit recommendations that were outstanding during this period.  However, ACF did not resolve 7,531 of the 10,979 recommendations within the required 6-month period.  In addition, as of September 30, 2008, ACF had not resolved 2,086 audit recommendations that were past due for resolution.  The dollar amounts associated with these recommendations totaled $94.6 million.  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-50 requires prompt resolution and corrective actions on audit recommendations.  Resolution shall be made within a maximum of 6 months after the issuance of a final report.  As a result of ACF not resolving all audit recommendations in a timely manner, it did not have reasonable assurance that it was exercising proper stewardship over Federal dollars.</p> 

<p>We recommended that ACF (1) resolve all audit recommendations within the required 6-month audit resolution period and (2) resolve the 2,086 outstanding audit recommendations that were past due as of September 30, 2008.  In written comments on our draft report, ACF did not directly address our recommendations.  After reviewing ACF’s written comments, we reviewed our records and maintain that the stewardship report as of September 30, 2008, is accurate.  Moreover, ACF’s submission of required documentation after our audit period does not negate the validity of our findings and recommendations as of September 30, 2008. </p>
