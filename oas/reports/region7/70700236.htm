<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of our review was to determine whether Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Georgia (Georgia) complied with its Medicare contract’s 
pension segmentation requirements while implementing the prior audit findings 
and updating the Medicare segment’s assets from January 1, 1993, to May 31, 2001.&nbsp; Georgia did not implement the prior audit recommendation to increase Medicare 
segment assets and did not comply with its Medicare contract’s pension 
segmentation requirements while updating the segment’s assets from January 1, 
1993, to May 31, 2001. &nbsp;As a result, Georgia understated the May 31, 2001, 
Medicare segment pension assets by $85,654. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Georgia increase Medicare segment 
pension assets by $85,654 as of May 31, 2001, and implement controls to ensure 
that the Medicare segment’s assets are updated in accordance with the Medicare 
contract. &nbsp;Georgia concurred with our recommendations.</p>
