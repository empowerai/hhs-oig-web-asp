<p>Our objective was to determine whether Illinois’s method of computing inpatient hospital cost outlier
  payments resulted in reasonable payments.&nbsp; Illinois’s method of computing inpatient hospital cost
  outlier payments did not result in reasonable payments.&nbsp; Specifically, Illinois (1) used an out-of-date
  factor to convert billed charges to costs and (2) did not have adequate policies and procedures in
  place to monitor cost outlier payments.&nbsp; As a result, cost outlier payments increased significantly
  and at a faster rate than other types of Medicaid payments.&nbsp; If Illinois had applied a more current
  factor to convert billed charges to costs, it could have saved approximately $56.5 million between
  1998 and 2002 for the three hospitals we reviewed.&nbsp; We recommended that Illinois revise its method
  of computing cost outlier payments to ensure that payments are reasonable and that Illinois develop
  policies and procedures to more closely monitor cost outlier payments.&nbsp; Illinois acknowledged
  that cost outlier payments have increased significantly, but stated that the appropriateness of the
  increase must be viewed in the context of the current inpatient rate freeze.&nbsp; Illinois also stated
  that the State fiscal year (FY) 2006 proposed budget includes increasing the threshold amount in order
  to hold cost outlier payments at their FY 2005 levels.</p>
