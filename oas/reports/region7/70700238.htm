<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">The objective of our review was to determine the 
allowability of pension costs that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia (Georgia) 
claimed for Medicare reimbursement for fiscal years (FY) 1994 through 2000. 
&nbsp;Georgia did not claim $25,889 of allowable pension costs for FYs 1994 through 
2000 due to incorrect computations of CAS pension costs. &nbsp;Georgia claimed 
$1,012,072 of pension costs for Medicare reimbursement; however, allowable 
Medicare pension costs were $1,037,961. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Georgia revise its Final Administrative 
Cost Proposals to increase claimed pension costs by $25,889.&nbsp; We also 
recommended that Georgia claim future pension costs in accordance with Federal 
requirements and its Medicare contract. &nbsp;Georgia concurred with our 
recommendations.</p>
