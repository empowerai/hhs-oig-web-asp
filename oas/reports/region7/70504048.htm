<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Colorado had established adequate accountability
  for and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; <a>We found that </a>Colorado
  had adopted measures to strengthen controls with regard to billing and tracking $0 unit rebate
  amounts, adjusting collections, and retaining records for at least 3 years.&nbsp; Colorado
  lacked sufficient accountability and internal controls in the following areas: (1) Colorado
  continued to allocate an estimated percentage of Medicaid drug rebates to the Old Age Pension
  Health and Medical Care Program (OAP) program; (2) Colorado could not properly process OAP
  adjustments submitted by two manufacturers; (3) Colorado had disputes pending for 3 years
  because Colorado was not active enough in its efforts to resolve disputes and did not offer
  the State’s hearing mechanism to manufacturers; and (4) Colorado did not verify, record,
  or report rebate interest. </p>
<p>We recommend that Colorado:&nbsp; (1) refund&nbsp; $1,925,367 to the Federal Government;&nbsp; (2)
  establish procedures to enable separate billing for Medicaid drug rebates and OAP drug rebates;
  (3) actively pursue settlement of disputed amounts (including $388,592 in drug rebates that
  remained outstanding for more than 3 years) and utilize available dispute resolution resources;
  and (4) develop controls to ensure that interest is properly verified, recorded, and reported
  as required.&nbsp; Colorado did not agree with our first recommendation but it agreed with
  the remaining recommendations.</p>
