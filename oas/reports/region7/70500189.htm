<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of our review were to determine whether CIGNA complied with the Medicare contracts&rsquo; pension segmentation requirements while: (1) identifying the Medicare segment&rsquo;s initial asset allocation and (2) updating the Medicare segment&rsquo;s assets from the initial asset allocation to January 1, 2004.&nbsp;We found that CIGNA complied with the Medicare contracts&rsquo; pension segmentation requirements when identifying the Medicare segment&rsquo;s initial assets as of January 1, 1991.&nbsp;However, it did not comply with the contract when updating the segment&rsquo;s assets to January 1, 2004.&nbsp;The understatement primarily resulted from the update of assets and the actuarial approach used in allocating contributions and prepayments to the Medicare segment.&nbsp;As a result, CIGNA understated the January 1, 2004, Medicare segment assets by $99,898. </p>
<p>We recommended that CIGNA: (1) increase Medicare segment pension assets by $99,898 as of January 1, 2004, and (2) implement controls to ensure that the Medicare segment&rsquo;s assets are updated in accordance with the Medicare contracts.&nbsp;CIGNA disagreed in part with our original recommendation to increase Medicare segment assets by $158,339.&nbsp;However, CIGNA did agree to update future Medicare segment assets in accordance with Medicare contracts.</p>
