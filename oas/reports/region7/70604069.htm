<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency’s claims for Medicaid reimbursement for 
school-based services generally were not in accordance with Federal requirements 
or the State plan.&nbsp; We were unable to determine what portion of $36.8 million of 
the $37.9 million claimed was allowable as final payments.&nbsp; The State agency did 
not perform a cost settlement reconciling interim payments to actual costs to 
determine final payments, as required by the State plan, because it considered 
payments made to school districts to be final payments.&nbsp; The State agency’s 
claims for the remaining $1.1 million, which were for nursing services that were 
paid based on the Medicaid fee-for-service schedule, were allowable.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) work with the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services to determine what 
portion of the <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
$36.8 million claimed based on interim payments is allowable and (2) perform 
cost settlements to ensure that future final payments for school-based services 
are based on actual costs.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with the recommendations.</span></p>
