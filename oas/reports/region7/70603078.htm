<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Contrary to Federal and State requirements, the State 
agency claimed unallowable targeted case management (TCM) services during fiscal 
years 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; Of the 200 State agency claims for Medicaid reimbursement 
in our sample, 127 were allowable, the State agency did not properly claim 60, 
and 13 may not have been allowable.<b> </b>&nbsp;As a result, the State agency improperly 
claimed $2,495,948 ($1,510,153 Federal share) for TCM services that did not 
comply with Federal and State requirements.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund $1,510,153 to the Federal 
Government for unallowable TCM claims; (2) work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services to determine the allowability of the $196,116 of direct 
medical services incorrectly claimed as TCM services; and (3) establish policies and procedures strengthening its internal controls to 
ensure that TCM services claimed for Federal reimbursement are sufficiently 
documented to support the provision of TCM services, are provided in 
accordance with Federal regulations, and do not include direct medical services.&nbsp; 
The State agency partially concurred with our third recommendation and did not 
concur with the first two recommendations.</p>
