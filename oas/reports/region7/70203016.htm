<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The purpose of our review was to determine 
  the allowability of $180,244 costs claimed for Medicare reimbursement by Transamerica 
  Occidental Life Insurance Company (TOLIC).&nbsp; The $180,244 represents Supplemental 
  Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) costs that will be incurred subsequent to the 
  termination of TOLIC’s Medicare contract.&nbsp; The review 
  showed that the claimed costs are unallowable for Medicare reimbursement and 
  we recommend that TOLIC withdraw the claim.&nbsp; The TOLIC disagreed that the 
  SERP costs were unallowable. </p>
