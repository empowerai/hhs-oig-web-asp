<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if the State correctly calculated the cost outlier
  payments for all DRGs from State fiscal years (FY) 2000 through 2003.&nbsp; We
  found that the State did not correctly calculate cost outlier payments for certain DRGs.&nbsp; The
  State’s contractor used a 1.94 standard deviation factor in computing the threshold amount rather than
  the 1.96 factor required by the Medicaid State Plan and State regulations.&nbsp; In addition, while
  the State effectively updated the factors used to calculate the DRG base and cost outlier payment in
  3 out of 4 years that we reviewed, the State did not update the factors effective October 1, 2002 on
  a timely basis.&nbsp; The errors occurred because the State neither adequately monitored the outlier
  payment calculation nor ensured factors used to calculate the DRG base and outlier payments were updated
in a timely manner. </p>
<p>We recommend the State:&nbsp; (1) collect $775,354
  for cost outlier overpayments to the seven hospitals due to the use of the incorrect threshold factor
  (and refund the Federal share of $476,533 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS));
  (2) reprocess the improperly paid claims to the seven hospitals due to not updating the payment factors
  effective October 2002 in a timely manner.&nbsp; For the claims associated with a cost outlier payment,
  collect $368,251 for Medicaid base and outlier overpayments and underpayments (and refund the federal
  share of $226,326 to CMS).&nbsp; For the remaining Medicaid base claims, calculate the effect of the
  error and remit the Federal share of any overpayment to CMS; (3) calculate the effect of the errors
  for the remaining Medicaid hospitals and remit the Federal share of any overpayments to CMS; and (4)
  develop and implement policies and procedures to more closely monitor outlier payments.&nbsp; Specifically,
  ensure that the outlier threshold amount is correctly calculated for future outlier payments.&nbsp; In
  addition, on an ongoing basis, review factors used in the DRG base and outlier calculation to ensure
accuracy and timeliness of future payments.&nbsp; The State concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
