</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our review of overpayment collections made 
  for the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program by the 
  Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (DSRS).&nbsp; The objective 
  of our review was to determine whether DSRS remitted the Federal share of AFDC 
  overpayment collections to the Federal government after the program was repealed.&nbsp; 
  During the period October 1, 1996 through March 31, 2001, the DSRS remitted 
  the Federal share of AFDC overpayments totaling $2,102,779 to the U.S. Department 
  of Health and Human Services - Administration for Children and Families as required.&nbsp; 
  However, DSRS did not begin submitting quarterly payments for the above period 
  until December 26, 2000. We recommended DSRS continue making <i>quarterly</i> 
  payments for the Federal share of AFDC overpayments as required.&nbsp; The DSRS 
  agreed with our findings and recommendation.</p>
