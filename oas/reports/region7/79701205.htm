<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of Pension Costs claimed 
  for Medicare Reimbursement by Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska (Washington/Alaska) 
  for Fiscal Years 1993 through 1995. During this period, the allowable Medicare 
  pension costs were $57,826. However, Washington/Alaska claimed pension costs 
  of $73,514 for Medicare reimbursement. As a result, Washington/Alaska claimed 
  $15,688 in pension costs that were not allowable. The over claim occurred primarily 
  because Washington/Alaska used an inappropriate cost when calculating pension 
  costs attributable to Medicare indirect operations. We recommended Washington/Alaska 
  revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals to eliminate the unallowable 
  pension costs. We also recommended that Washington/Alaska base future claims 
  for pension costs on costs calculated in accordance with the Cost Accounting 
  Standards. Washington/Alaska agreed with our recommendations. </p>
