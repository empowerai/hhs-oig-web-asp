<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Indian Health Service (IHS) had (1) resolved all audit recommendations as of December 31, 2005, and (2) resolved audit recommendations in a timely manner during calendar years (CY) 2003&ndash;2005.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2005, IHS had not resolved 6,653 audit recommendations, of which 94 percent were past due for resolution.&nbsp;During CYs 2003&ndash;2005, IHS resolved 2,840 of the 9,493 audit recommendations that were outstanding during this period.&nbsp;However, it did not resolve 2,727 of the 2,840 recommendations within the required 6-month period. </p>
<p>We recommended that IHS (1) resolve the backlog of outstanding audit recommendations and (2) resolve all audit recommendations within 6 months of receiving the audit reports as required. IHS concurred with both recommendations.</p>
