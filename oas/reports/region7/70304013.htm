<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The audit objective was to evaluate whether the Nebraska Health and Human Services
  System (HHSS) had established adequate accountability and internal controls over
  the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We determined the HHSS lacked sufficient
  internal controls with regard to the Medicaid drug rebate program as required by
  Federal rules and regulations.&nbsp; As a result, drug rebate receivables were
  perpetually understated and it is likely that the HHSS did not receive all drug
  rebates and interest on disputed or late rebate payments due from manufacturers.&nbsp; In
  addition, the HHSS did not have reasonable assurance that drug rebate balances
  and collections reported to CMS were accurate.&nbsp; Moreover, the lack of sufficient
  internal controls increased the risk for fraud, waste, or abuse of drug rebate
  program funds.</p>
