<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability 
  of administrative costs included in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process 
  for determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed 
  care organizations (MCO). At a Missouri-based MCO we found costs of $783,297 
  (Medicare share $227,156) that would be considered inappropriate when compared 
  to the Medicare program's general principle of paying only reasonable costs. 
  These costs included donations, gifts, political contributions, lobbying, memberships, 
  sponsorships, entertainment, parties, promotional giveaways, and out-of-period 
  costs. In addition, MCO officials did not provide documentation to support costs 
  of $2,243,313 (Medicare share $650,561). As a result, we estimate Medicare beneficiaries 
  paid about $1.5 million in excessive premiums and copayments in contract year 
  2000. In this final report we point out the flaws in the current methodology 
  which results in Medicare covering a disproportionate share of the MCO's administrative 
  costs. Additional reviews are ongoing and preliminary results show similar problems 
  at other MCOs. The results of these reviews are being shared with the Health 
  Care Financing Administration so that appropriate legislative changes can be 
  considered. </p>
