<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Missouri's retroactive claim for enhanced Federal reimbursement
  for Medicaid family planning expenditures complied with Federal regulations.&nbsp; Missouri's retroactive
  claim did not fully comply with Federal regulations, which generally limit reimbursement of State expenditures
  to claims filed within 2 years of the expenditure. Of the $11.1 million claimed, $6,467,583 did not
  meet this limitation and therefore was unallowable. We recommended that Missouri refund $6,467,583
  to the Federal Government and ensure that future retroactive claims submitted for Medicaid reimbursement
  comply with Federal regulations. Missouri did not agree that its retroactive claim was subject to the
  2-year rule. Missouri also said that it already had internal controls to claim appropriate costs.</p>
