<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The objectives of our 
review were to determine </span>whether the Department of Social Services (State agency) appropriately reported 
program income for (1) undistributable child support collections that met the 
State’s definition of abandoned property and (2) interest earned on program 
funds.&nbsp; <A>We found that t</A>he State agency did not always report program 
income for (1) undistributable child support collections that met the State’s 
definition of abandoned property or (2) interest earned on program funds.&nbsp; 
The State agency did not always report program income because in certain 
circumstances it either (1) had inadequate policies and procedures or (2) did 
not follow its policies and procedures.&nbsp; As a result, for the period 
October 1, 1998, through September 30, 2005, the State agency did not recognize 
and report program income totaling an estimated $692,618 ($457,128 Federal 
share).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <A>We recommended </A>that the State 
agency:&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman">
(1) </span>report on the quarterly Federal financial report (form OCSE-396A) 
$361,439 ($238,550 Federal share) in Title IV-D program income that has been 
transferred to the State Treasurer as abandoned property;<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"> 
(2)&nbsp; </span>report $331,179 ($218,578 Federal share) in Title IV-D program 
income on form OCSE-396A after it: works with St. Louis city officials from the 
County Circuit Clerk’s office to close the open bank account and transfer the 
undistributable child support collections and interest income to the State 
Treasurer, and transfers the $74,702 ($49,303 Federal share) of Title IV-D 
undistributable child support collections within the MACSS to the State 
Treasurer as abandoned property; (3) work with OCSE to review the other 111 
County Circuit Clerk offices and determine whether they have appropriately 
declared and transferred to the State Treasurer any remaining undistributable 
child support collections and interest income; (4) report any remaining 
undistributable child support collections and interest income from the other 111 
County Circuit Clerk offices as program income on form OCSE-396A; (5) revise its 
policies and procedures to ensure that undistributable child support collections 
are considered abandoned within 3 years from the date the collections could have 
been claimed by the owner; and (6) provide training to personnel responsible for 
preparing the quarterly Federal financial report forms OCSE-34A and OCSE-396A to 
ensure that the forms are completed appropriately.&nbsp; The State agency agreed 
with all of our audit findings and recommendations.&nbsp; The State agency comments 
are included in their entirety as Appendix B.</p>
