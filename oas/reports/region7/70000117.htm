<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This report provides the results of our review titled, "Review of Pension Costs 
  Claimed for Medicare Reimbursement by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Dakota." 
  The purpose of our review was to determine the allowability of pension costs 
  claimed for Medicare reimbursement for Fiscal Years 1992 through 1998. We determined 
  that North Dakota overclaimed allowable Medicare pension costs for 1992 through 
  1998. During this period, the allowable Medicare pension costs were $3,200,126. 
  However, North Dakota claimed pension costs of $3,216,989 for Medicare reimbursement. 
  As a result, North Dakota has claimed $16,863 in pension costs that are not 
  allowable. The overclaim occurred because the pension costs claimed exceeded 
  the funded portion of the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) computed pension costs. 
  We recommend that North Dakota revise its Final Administrative Cost Proposals 
  (FACPs) to eliminate the unallowable pension costs.</p>
