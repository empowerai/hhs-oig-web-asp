<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the 43 States reviewed, 24 States complied with Federal 
requirements and reimbursed ACF $59 million for the Federal share of Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayment recoveries from July 2002 
through June 2006.&nbsp; Although the remaining 19 States and the
District of Columbia continued to recover overpayments from former AFDC 
recipients after the program ended, these governments did not reimburse ACF 
$28.7 million for the Federal share of their recoveries.&nbsp; The 19 States and the 
District of Columbia did not reimburse ACF as required because they did not 
follow ACF’s program instruction on refunding the Federal share of AFDC 
overpayment recoveries.&nbsp; In addition, ACF did not have monitoring procedures to 
ensure that the Federal Government received its share of AFDC overpayment 
recoveries from all States.&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"> recommended 
that ACF (1) collect from the 19 States and the District of Columbia the Federal 
share of AFDC overpayment recoveries totaling $28.7 million and (2) establish 
monitoring procedures to ensure that the Federal Government receives its share 
of future State-recovered AFDC overpayments in a timely manner. &nbsp;ACF agreed with 
both recommendations.</span>
