<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>This report presents the results of our review of medical education payments claimed by the Hartford Hospital for the
  fiscal year ended September 30, 1999.&nbsp; The objective of our review was to determine the accuracy of resident full
  time equivalent counts used to calculate direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education payments.&nbsp; We
  identified and recommended for adjustment about $1.5 million because the Hospital claimed reimbursement for residents who:&nbsp; (a)
  participated in non-reimbursable residency training; (b) exceeded their initial residency period without appropriate GME
  weighting reductions; (c) lacked sufficient rotation documentation; (d) rotated to non-provider settings without the appropriate
  contractual agreement; (e) spent time in unallowable research activities; (f) rotated to non-reimbursable Hospital areas;
  and, (g) had rotation documentation which contained various posting errors.&nbsp; The Hospital agreed with $860,875 of
  our audit findings and plans to develop and improve procedures to correct these issues.&nbsp; The Hospital disagreed primarily
  on selected cases involving non-reimbursable residency programs, insufficient rotation documentation, and non-reimbursable
  non-provider settings.</p>
