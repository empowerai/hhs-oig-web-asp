<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the State:&nbsp; (1) properly recorded, summarized and reported
  bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus area designated in the cooperative agreements; and (2) established
  controls and procedures to monitor subrecipients expenditures of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds.&nbsp; We
  found that the State generally accounted for the Program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative
  agreement and applicable departmental regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; We recommended that the State implement the random
  audit component and address problem areas as they are identified to ensure adequate oversight of subrecipients.&nbsp; The
  auditee concurred.</p>
