<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p> According to the Massachusetts State Plan, hospitals should not be reimbursed for outpatient services rendered during
  an inpatient stay.&nbsp; To perform our review, we independently generated a computer match of outpatient non-physician
  services rendered during an inpatient stay with claim paid dates from October 1, 1999 through March 31, 2001.&nbsp; Based
  on the results of this computer match, we reviewed a random sample of 100 and found that only 2 of the 100 services were
  duplicated.&nbsp; Accordingly, we concluded that the risk is low that DMA made duplicate payments for outpatient services
  rendered during an inpatient stay.</p>
