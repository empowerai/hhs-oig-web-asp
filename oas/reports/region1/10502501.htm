<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p>Our objective was to determine whether Connecticut has 
continued to reimburse the Federal Government for its share of collected Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayments in a timely manner.&nbsp; 
Connecticut reimbursed the Federal share of AFDC collections for 15 of the 16 
quarters that we reviewed.&nbsp; It did not reimburse the Federal share of AFDC 
collections for one quarter in a timely manner.&nbsp; We recommended that Connecticut 
strengthen its internal controls to verify that the Federal Government receives 
its share of future AFDC collections.&nbsp; Connecticut agreed to renew efforts to 
verify that the Federal Government receives and cashes checks from the State.</p>
