<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Previous audits identified overpayments to home health agencies that did not comply with
  Medicare requirements for billing services preceded by discharges from both an acute care
  hospital and a postacute care facility.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Our objective was to determine whether home health agencies complied with Medicare requirements
  in billing for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 services that were preceded by discharges from
  both an acute care hospital and a postacute care facility.&nbsp; Home health agencies did
  not comply with Medicare requirements in billing for services that were preceded within 14
  days by discharges from both an acute care hospital and a postacute care facility.&nbsp; Specifically,
  the home health agencies improperly coded all 400 sampled claims as discharges from a postacute
  care facility only, rather than discharges from both an acute care hospital and a postacute
  care facility.&nbsp; Overpayments to home health agencies for these claims totaled $122,674. </p>
<p>We recommended that CMS:&nbsp; (1) instruct its regional home health intermediaries to recover
  the $122,674 in overpayments related to the 400 sampled claims, (2) direct the intermediaries
  to use our files containing the remaining 142,069 paid claims with billing errors to recover
  additional overpayments estimated at $48 million, (3) emphasize to home health agencies the
  need to strengthen billing controls by educating their staffs regarding the identification
  of all facilities that discharged the beneficiary within 14 days of the home health episode,&nbsp;(4)
  monitor the effectiveness of the newly established prepayment edits and postpayment controls,
  and (5) develop data analysis techniques to identify home health agencies with significant
  numbers of claims rejected or adjusted by the newly implemented payment controls and subject
  those home health agencies to appropriate corrective action.&nbsp; In its comments on our
  draft report, CMS concurred with the recommendations.</p>
