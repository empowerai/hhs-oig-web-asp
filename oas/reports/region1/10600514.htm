<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<P><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The objective 
of this review was to determine whether VNA Care Network, Inc., (the agency) 
complied with Medicare requirements in billing for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 
services for beneficiaries who had been discharged from an acute-care hospital 
in the preceding 14 days. The agency improperly coded 161 claims as if the 
beneficiaries had not been discharged from an acute care hospital within the 
14-day period preceding the home health admission.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services’s prepayment edit corrected 138 of the 161 claims.&nbsp; 
Overpayments for the 23 claims not identified by the edit totaled $6,178.&nbsp; We 
recommended that the agency:&nbsp; (1) return the $6,178 overpayment to the 
appropriate regional home health intermediary and (2) further educate its staff 
regarding the importance of identifying all facilities that had discharged the 
beneficiary within 14 days of the home health episode and determining which of 
these facilities were acute care (including long-term care) hospitals.&nbsp; The 
agency agreed with our findings.</span></P></BODY></HTML>
