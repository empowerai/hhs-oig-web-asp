<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether MaineGeneral Medical Center (the hospital) billed
  fiscal year-end inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) claims for 2002-2004 in accordance with Medicare
  regulations.&nbsp; The hospital did not bill fiscal year-end claims for its IRF in accordance with
  Medicare regulations.&nbsp; As a result, Medicare made net overpayments totaling $254,915.&nbsp; The
  hospital received inaccurate information from its fiscal intermediary that contributed to the problem
  of split billing in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the hospital improve controls to ensure that current Medicare billing guidelines
  are followed.&nbsp; We also recommended that the hospital continue to work with its fiscal intermediary
  to complete the voluntary repayment process involving the net overpayments of $254,915 and determine
  the resulting effect on its Medicare cost reports for 2002 - 2004.&nbsp; The hospital agreed with our
  recommendations.</p>
