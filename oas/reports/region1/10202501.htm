<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of Massachusetts’ procedures for identifying and intercepting
  insurance claim payments from non-custodial parents (NCP) with past due child support.&nbsp; We found that the Massachusetts
  program was highly effective in collecting over $9 million from 3,052 insurance payments to non-custodial parents from
  April 1999 through September 2001.&nbsp; For child support cases with delinquent balances, our analysis of the insurance
  amounts intercepted showed the collections: (i) reduced outstanding child support for an estimated 3,052 delinquent cases
  by about 22 percent, (ii) increased financial support to children by an estimated $5.4 million, and (iii) recovered public
  assistance paid to custodial parents and their children by an estimated $4.4 million (Federal share $2.2 million).&nbsp; </p>
