<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>There are no Federal requirements for States to pursue recovery of Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance
  correctly paid to recipients. However, some States, including Connecticut, have instituted a requirement that any recipient
  who subsequently acquired financial resources must use those resources to repay the amount of AFDC assistance received.&nbsp; This
  final report points out that Connecticut has recovered such assistance, estimated at $9 million (Federal share) over the
  period October 1, 1997 to March 31, 2001, but has not refunded this amount to the Federal Government.&nbsp; Connecticut
  begin refunding the Federal share of such recoveries for the quarter ended June 30, 2001. We recommended that the State
  return the $9 million, and continue the process of returning the Federal share of collected AFDC recoveries that was instituted
  in June 2001.</p>
