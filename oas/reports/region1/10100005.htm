<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the New Bedford Public Schools billed the Medicaid program $264,226 (Federal share)
  for school-based health services on 34 dates when the school was not open to students.&nbsp; In addition, New Bedford Public
  Schools billed the Medicaid program:(1) when students were absent, (2) for several students who were not prescribed to
  receive school-based health services, and (3) for several students for which the school system did not locate any documentation
  to demonstrate that services prescribed were delivered.&nbsp; We estimate that the New Bedford Public Schools were inappropriately
  overpaid at least $290,193 (Federal share)&nbsp; in these cases.&nbsp; In addition to procedural corrections, we recommended
  that New Bedford Public Schools refund $554,419.&nbsp; School officials generally agreed with our procedural recommendations,
  but did not express agreement or disagreement with the recommended financial adjustment.</p>
