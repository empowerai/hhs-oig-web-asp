<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Maine's State agency's&nbsp;retroactive claims for Medicaid school-based
  health services complied with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State agency did not follow Federal regulations when it processed
  the retroactive claims for Medicaid school-based health services and did not incur any expenditures because it did not
  remit the Federal share received for these claims to the provider school districts.&nbsp; The State agency was overpaid
  $3,044,211 (Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency refund the $3,044,211 to the Federal Government
  and follow prescribed procedures to ensure that the State properly refunds the Federal share for uncashed or voided checks
  in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State agency did not agree to repay the $3,044,211.&nbsp; However, the
  State agency agreed that the payment procedures it used to process claims for retroactive school-based costs were inappropriate
  and said that it would work with CMS to develop an acceptable payment process.</p>
