<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether
    costs that the University of Massachusetts Medical School (the University) claimed for grant no.
    5 R01 GM30626-22 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were allowable under the terms of the
    grant and applicable Federal regulations. &nbsp;We identified $281,993 in costs that did not comply
    with OMB Circulars A-21 and A-110.&nbsp; Of this total, $193,682 was in unsupported nonlabor costs
    and related indirect costs, and $88,311 was in overstated labor and related fringe and indirect costs.&nbsp; We
    recommended that the University:&nbsp; (1) ensure that accounting records are and retained; (2) comply
    with requirements to provide a timely and detailed explanation and related documentation on transfers;
    (3) improve its payroll distribution system; (4) ensure that the financial status reports that it
    submits are accurate and timely and correct its final financial report; (5) improve its payroll distribution
    system; (6) work with NIH to provide a reasonable adjustment for all improperly recorded grant application
    activity; (7) identify and notify NIH of unobligated balances exceeding 25 percent of the total award
    for the prior year; and, (8) refund $281,993 to NIH in overstated and/or unsupported costs.&nbsp; The
    University generally disagreed with our recommendations.</p>
