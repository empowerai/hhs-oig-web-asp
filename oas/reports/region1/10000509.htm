<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out a major flaw in the claims processing systems of the four durable medical equipment regional
  carriers (DMERC). Federal regulations prohibit Medicare Part B payments for durable medical equipment (DME) on behalf of
  a beneficiary who is in a Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility (SNF) for an entire month. In such cases the Medicare
  Part A reimbursement to the SNF would cover the DME services and the SNF would be responsible for paying the DME provider
  or supplier. Our final report points out, however, that the four DMERCs made improper Medicare Part B payments for such
  services during calendar years 1996 through 1998. We estimate the overpayments totaled approximately $35 million, and were
  due, in part, to lack of adequate edits in the DMERCs&#146; claims processing systems. In addition, coinsurance payments
  of approximately $9 million related to these DME items may have also been overpaid by the Medicaid program, supplemental
  insurance programs, or by the beneficiaries themselves. In addition to recovery of the overpayments, we recommended that
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) work with the DMERCs to implement edits to identify and prevent such
  payments in the future. The CMS generally concurred with our recommendations and has agreed to take corrective action.</p>
