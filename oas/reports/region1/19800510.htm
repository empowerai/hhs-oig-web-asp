<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability of administrative costs included in the
  adjusted community rate (ACR) process for determining Medicare capitation rates under risk-based contracts with managed
  care organizations (MCO). At a Massachusetts risk-based MCO we identified over $1.4 million in administrative costs that
  would be considered inappropriate and unallowable if considered in light of the Medicare program's general principle of
  paying only reasonable costs. Examples of such costs included lobbying costs, entertainment costs and unsupported costs.
  The methodology which allows MCOs to apportion administrative costs to Medicare is flawed and results in Medicare covering
  a disproportionate amount of the MCO's administrative costs. Additional reviews are underway and preliminary results show
  similar problems at other MCOs. The results of these reviews will be shared with the Health Care Health Financing Administration
  in the coming months so that appropriate legislative changes can be considered. </p>
