<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that methodologies used by the Connecticut Department
  of Social Services (state agency) to develop reimbursement rates for the school
  based child health program (SBCHP) were not in accordance with federal regulations,
  standards, and guidelines.&nbsp; Monthly SBCHP treatment service rates were
  overstated by at least 50 percent resulting in excess reimbursement of about
  $32.8 million (federal share) to the state for the period July 1, 1997 through
  June 30, 2001.&nbsp; In addition to inadequate rate setting methodologies,
  the state agency did not establish adequate procedures to verify that the cost
  data submitted by local education agencies were allowable and allocable for
  reimbursement under the SBCHP.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment
  and procedural improvements.&nbsp; The state agency disagreed with our recommendation
  for a financial adjustment, but recognized the need for changes to the methods
  used to develop reimbursement rates.</p>
