<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period September 1, 2006, through October 23, 2007, 
Head Start Board of Directors, Inc. (HSBD), a Head Start grantee, did not fully 
comply with Federal and State requirements regarding the safety of children in 
its care and the management of and accounting for Federal funds.&nbsp; HSBD provides 
educational and daycare services to children in Rhode Island’s Greater 
Providence and Blackstone Valley areas.&nbsp; The Administration for Children 
and Families (ACF), which administers the Head Start 
program, requested that we audit HSBD.<br>
<br>
We found that HSBD jeopardized the safety of children in its care by not fully 
complying with requirements for fire inspections and preemployment background 
checks.&nbsp; In addition, HSBD’s financial management systems did not meet Federal 
requirements for disclosing the results of each federally sponsored program and 
effectively accounting for Federal funds and assets.&nbsp;
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
<br>
Based on our preliminary audit findings, ACF suspended HSBD’s funding in October 
2007, and the Departmental Appeals Board upheld the suspension in January 2008.&nbsp; 
Because ACF has suspended HSBD’s funding indefinitely, we are not making any 
recommendations to HSBD.&nbsp; Instead, we are providing this report to ACF for use 
in overseeing the Head Start grant that serves children in the Greater 
Providence and Blackstone Valley areas.</span></p>
