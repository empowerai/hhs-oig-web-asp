<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that a significant amount of outpatient psychiatric claims made by Elliot hospital
  did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements. Specifically, charges for psychiatric care were found to be medically
  unnecessary or were not properly supported by medical records. Based on a statistical sample, we estimate that at least
  $314,359 in outpatient psychiatric charges did not meet Medicare's requirements. We also identified $11,315 in costs ineligible
  for Medicare reimbursement claimed by the hospital on its Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 cost report for outpatient psychiatric
  services. We recommended that the hospital strengthen its procedures to ensure that charges for psychiatric services are
  covered and properly documented in accordance with Medicare requirements. We also recommended that the hospital establish
  nonreimbursable cost centers or otherwise exclude costs related to noncovered services from its Medicare cost reports.
  We will provide the results of our review to the fiscal intermediary so that it can apply the appropriate financial adjustments
  to the hospital's FY 1998 Medicare cost report. </p>
