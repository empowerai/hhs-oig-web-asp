<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report presents the results of our audit of the Medicaid drug rebate program in the State of New Hampshire.&nbsp; The
  objective of our audit was to evaluate whether the State agency had established adequate accountability and internal controls
  over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; We found that procedures for reconciling and reporting the pending drug rebate
  amounts and corresponding ageing of these rebates on the Medicaid Quarterly Expenditure Report submitted to Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were not established. &nbsp;In addition, we determined that the State agency did not
  have procedures in place to monitor the collection of interest due from manufacturers.&nbsp; We recommended that the State
  agency; (1) develop a pending drug rebate ageing schedule for use in the proper preparation of the CMS report, and (2)
  continue its efforts to develop procedures for the proper monitoring and collection of interest owed by manufacturers for
  overdue drug rebate amounts.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our recommendations and has developed corrective action
  plans to address the issues identified in our report.</p>
