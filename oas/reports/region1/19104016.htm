<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General and the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget requested that major schools under
  HHS' cognizance conduct internal reviews of their current procedures (self scrubs) to ensure that only allowable costs
  are included in the indirect costs allocated to Federal research. This management advisory report provides the results
  of those reviews. We found that 193 of the 261 major schools under HHS' cognizance have completed self scrubs as of January
  31, 1993 and have identified unallowable costs totaling $62.9 million. Based on past experience, approximately 10 percent
  of the total unallowable cost was allocated to Federal research. The withdrawal of these costs from allocations to Federal
  research reduces indirect cost rates at various schools from one-tenth of 1 percent to as much as 4 percent. </p>
