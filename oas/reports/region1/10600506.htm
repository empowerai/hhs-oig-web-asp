<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Associated Hospital Service (the Intermediary) paid eight Massachusetts long-term care hospitals' (LTCH) claims in accordance with Medicare requirements when beneficiaries had used all of their regular covered benefit days.&nbsp;The Intermediary made full diagnosis-related group payments for (1) claims that should have been reduced to a short-stay outlier payment and (2) claims that should have been reduced by the beneficiaries&rsquo; coinsurance amounts for lifetime reserve days.&nbsp;The Intermediary made overpayments totaling $936,418 for 83 claims to 8 LTCHs for services provided from January 1, 2003, through April 30, 2004, because the Intermediary did not ensure that LTCHs' claims contained the appropriate coverage status codes.&nbsp;We recommended that the Intermediary recover the overpayments made to 8 LTCHs for 83 claims totaling $936,418.&nbsp;The Intermediary generally agreed with our recommendation.</p>
