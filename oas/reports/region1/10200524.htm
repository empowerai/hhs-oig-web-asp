<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether physicians' claims identified the proper location of service for
  ambulatory surgical procedures provided to New England beneficiaries during calendar year 2001.&nbsp; Based on a statistical
  sample of 100 ambulatory surgical procedures billed incorrectly, we identified 63 that incorrectly used a non-facility
  place of service code.&nbsp; As a result, the National Heritage Insurance Company (NHIC) made payments to physicians that,
  on average, were about 20 percent higher than the appropriate fee schedule payments.&nbsp; In total, NHIC processed 5,373
  claims with potential overpayments estimated at over $146,000.&nbsp; These overpayments occurred because physician-billing
  personnel had not established adequate billing controls and NHIC had not established the payment controls necessary to
  detect billing errors.&nbsp; We recommended that NHIC: (1) utilize our data to recover the overpayments estimated at over
  $146,000; (2) issue guidelines to physicians for billing ambulatory surgical procedures correctly; and (3) conduct post
  payment data analysis to detect claims billed incorrectly. NHIC generally agreed with our finding and recommendations.</p>
