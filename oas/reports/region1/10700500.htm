<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether inpatient 
psychiatric facilities (IPF) properly submitted Medicare claims paid by 
AdminaStar Federal (AdminaStar) for transition stays.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">IPFs did not always properly submit claims paid by 
AdminaStar for transition stays in 2005.&nbsp; Specifically, for 76 of the 100 claims 
that we sampled (from the population of 638 claims), IPFs incorrectly split the 
beneficiary’s stay by submitting 1 claim under the Tax Equity and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act of 1982 payment period and a second claim under the 
prospective payment period, rather than properly submitting 1 claim for the 
entire inpatient stay.&nbsp; Based on our sample results, we estimate that AdminaStar 
overpaid IPFs a total of $2.17 million for incorrectly billed Medicare claims 
for transition stays in 2005.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommend that AdminaStar (1) make the appropriate 
adjustments to the sampled claims that resulted in overpayments of $340,858, (2) 
review our information on the additional 538 claims with potential overpayments 
estimated at $1.83 million ($2.17 million less $340,858) and work with the IPFs 
that provided the services to recover any overpayments, and (3) analyze 
postpayment data from IPF claims submitted after our review to ensure that the 
claims were billed properly and paid correctly by AdminaStar.&nbsp; AdminaStar agreed 
with our findings and recommendations and stated that it was taking appropriate 
action.</p>
