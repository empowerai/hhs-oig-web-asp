<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the severance and termination costs that Blue Cross &amp; Blue
  Shield of Rhode Island (Rhode Island) claimed are allowable, allocable, and reasonable, in accordance
  with Medicare contract provisions, Federal regulations, and company policies.&nbsp; From February 1,
  2004, through December 1, 2004, Rhode Island claimed $205,474 in severance and termination costs that
  were not allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; These unallowable claims were made because Rhode
  Island did not have adequate internal control procedures to ensure that costs were claimed in accordance
  with Federal regulations.</p>
<p>We recommended that Rhode Island reduce its severance and termination vouchers by $205,474 ($73,971
  Part A and $131,503 Part B).&nbsp; In response to our draft report, Rhode Island agreed with the recommended
  disallowances of $193,450 in unallowable costs.&nbsp; However, Rhode Island did not agree with $12,024
  in unallowable depreciation and asset write-off costs.</p>
