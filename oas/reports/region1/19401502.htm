<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Public Health Service (PHS) implemented five recommendations made in our prior report.
  Specifically, PHS: (1) centralized the technology transfer function by designating the National Institutes of Health as
  lead agency for the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 in the PHS, effective June 7, 1994; (2) established procedures
  to ensure that valuable foreign patent rights are obtained and filed in a timely manner; (3) completed a reconciliation
  of patent applications; (4) declared a material weakness in the FY 1993 FMFIA report; and (5) conducted a detailed internal
  control review of technology transfer activities. Since our review determined that PHS took appropriate corrective actions,
  we have no additional recommendations to make. </p>
