<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Department of Children and Families (the State agency)
  properly claimed Federal reimbursement at the enhanced rate for Title IV-E training costs
  during our audit period of July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2004.&nbsp; 
  The State agency overstated the Federal share of foster care and adoption assistance costs
  by $2.4 million by improperly claiming for: 26 training courses that should not have been
  charged to Title IV-E, 59 administrative courses that did not meet the requirements for enhanced
  reimbursement but were eligible for reimbursement at the 50-percent rate, and central office
  administration costs that did not meet the requirements for enhanced reimbursement but were
  eligible for reimbursement at the 50-percent rate.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) make a financial adjustment of $2.4 million on
  its next quarterly Report of Expenditures, (2) establish procedures to ensure that only qualified
  training expenses are claimed at the enhanced rate, and (3) review training costs for Federal
  reimbursement after the audit period to ensure compliance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The
  State agency agreed with our recommendations and said it was taking appropriate corrective
  action.</p>
