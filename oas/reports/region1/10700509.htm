<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal">
UMass Memorial Medical Center (the Hospital) </span></span>did not fully comply 
with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its FY 2006 Medicare cost 
report.&nbsp; Specifically, the Hospital overstated its wages by $13,408,945 and 
139,916 hours.&nbsp; Our correction of the Hospital’s errors decreased the average 
hourly wage rate approximately 2 percent.&nbsp; The errors occurred because the 
Hospital did not sufficiently review and reconcile wage data to ensure that all 
amounts reported were accurate, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare 
requirements.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the Hospital (1) submit a revised FY 2006 Medicare cost 
report to the fiscal intermediary to correct the wage data overstatements 
totaling $13,408,945 and 139,916 hours and (2) implement review and 
reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage data reported in future 
Medicare cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare 
requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital did not agree with all of our findings.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, the Hospital stated that it would resubmit its Medicare cost 
report.</p>
