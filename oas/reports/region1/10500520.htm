<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoHeader">The objective of our review was to determine whether 
inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) 
under the administrative responsibility of AdminaStar Federal (AdminaStar) 
billed fiscal year-end inpatient rehabilitation claims in accordance with 
Medicare requirements during the transition to the prospective payment system in 
2002.&nbsp; Twenty IRFs did not bill fiscal year-end claims in accordance with 
Medicare requirements.&nbsp; As a result, Medicare made net overpayments of 
$272,564.&nbsp; Some IRFs did not have adequate controls to 
ensure that claims submitted at fiscal year-end were billed accordance with 
Medicare requirements, and several IRFs stated that they had received inaccurate 
information from AdminaStar.<br>
<br>
We recommended that AdminaStar make the 
appropriate adjustments to paid claims that resulted in net overpayments of 
$272,564 to the 20 IRFs and continue education efforts for IRF and AdminaStar 
personnel.&nbsp; AdminaStar agreed with our recommendations.</p>
