<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the State agency appropriately reported program income for undistributable child support collections and interest earned on program funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the period October 1, 1998, through September 30, 2005, the State agency did not report program income totaling $1.9 million ($1.3 million Federal share) for child support collections that qualified as abandoned property.&nbsp;Pursuant to Federal requirements and Massachusetts law, the State agency should have declared these collections abandoned and reported them as undistributable and program income.&nbsp;This deficiency occurred because the State agency did not have adequate procedures to identify and report collections that met the State&rsquo;s abandoned property requirements.&nbsp;The regional Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) audit office will review the acceptability of the State agency&rsquo;s calculations of unreported interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency:&nbsp;(1) report child support collections totaling $1.9 million ($1.3 million Federal share) as abandoned and undistributable on Federal Form OCSE-34A, &ldquo;Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Report of Collections,&rdquo; and report this amount as program income on the next quarterly Federal Form OCSE 396-A, &ldquo;Child Support Enforcement Program Financial Report&rdquo; and (2) revise its procedures to ensure that undistributable child support collections meeting the State&rsquo;s abandoned property requirements are reported as undistributable and program income on the quarterly Federal financial reports.&nbsp;The State agency generally agreed with our recommendations.</p>
