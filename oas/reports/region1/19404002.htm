<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that for the most recently completed fiscal year for which data was available, three
  of the four universities we reviewed charged federally sponsored research about $5.7 million that we believe constitutes
  unreasonable compensation to graduate students. In our opinion, the three universities, in light of the unclear guidance
  provided by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, used a liberal interpretation of reasonableness which
  did not meet the &quot;prudent person&quot; requirement for such charges. We recommended that the Assistant Secretary for
  Management and Budget (ASMB) work with the OMB to provide more specific guidance on the standard of reasonableness for
  graduate student compensation. The ASMB concurred with our recommendation. </p>
