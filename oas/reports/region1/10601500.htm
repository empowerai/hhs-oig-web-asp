<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Boston University (the University) claimed subaward costs under a Harvard University grant from the National Institutes of Health in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subaward and applicable Federal regulations.&nbsp;From August 1, 2003, through July 31, 2005, the University claimed $11,234 in unallowable salary cost transfers and related fringe benefits and indirect costs that did not comply with Federal regulations and the terms of the subaward.&nbsp;In addition, the University did not submit its final invoice to the prime grantee within the specified time frame.</p>
<p>We recommended that the University:&nbsp;(1) comply with Federal and University requirements to ensure that cost transfers are properly authorized and documented, (2) establish controls to ensure that final invoices are submitted promptly, and&nbsp;(3) work with the prime grantor to resolve the $11,234 received from NIH for inappropriate cost transfers.&nbsp;In its response to our draft report, the University agreed with our procedural recommendations.&nbsp;However, the University maintained that all costs that it claimed under the subaward were reasonable, allocable, and allowable.</p>
