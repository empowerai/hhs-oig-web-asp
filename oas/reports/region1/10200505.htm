<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine the accuracy of resident Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) counts used by the
  Saint Elizabeth’s Medical Center (SEMC) during Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 to calculate Graduate Medical Education (GME) and
  Indirect Medical education (IME) payments.&nbsp; We determined that SEMC overstated its calculations for IME and GME by
  2.84 and .47 FTEs, respectively.&nbsp; These overstatements occurred because SEMC claimed reimbursement for residents:
  1) who spent time in unallowable research activities; 2) who exceeded their initial residency period yet were counted as
  if they were within their initial residency period; 3) whose time was not supported with adequate documentation; 4) who
  rotated to non-hospital settings; and 5) who were misclassified as primary care residents.&nbsp; We also identified a cost
  reporting error involving the Per Resident Amounts update factor.&nbsp; As a result of these errors, the hospital overclaimed
  GME and IME reimbursement by $121,395 on its FY 1999 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; </p>
