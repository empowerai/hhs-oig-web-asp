<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether outpatient clinic services were billed for and reimbursed in accordance
  with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; Our review covered the period October 1, 1998 to September 30, 1999 (FY1999).&nbsp; We
  reviewed the billing and medical records for a random sample of 100 clinical claims.&nbsp; Our analysis disclosed that
  17 of these claims did not meet the Medicare criteria for reimbursement.&nbsp; Based on a statistical sample, we estimate
  that the Hospital had overstated its Medicare clinic service charges by $181,118.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital
  strengthen its procedures to ensure that only charges for covered outpatient clinic services are billed to Medicare.&nbsp; Further,
  the Hospital should follow proper procedures in ensuring clinic visits submitted for reimbursement are allowed and documented
  in accordance with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; We will provide the results of our review to the fiscal intermediary, Associated
  Hospital Services, so that it can apply the appropriate adjustment of $181,118 to the Hospital’s FY 1999 Medicare cost
  report.</p>
