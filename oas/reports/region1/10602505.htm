<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Vermont reimbursed the Federal Government for its
  share of collected AFDC overpayments for the period October 2001 through March 2005. Vermont
  did not comply with Federal requirements for reimbursing the Federal share of collected AFDC
  overpayments. Vermont collected $66,781 ($40,650 Federal share) during the audit period.
  However, Vermont did not return the Federal share of the recovered overpayments to ACF. We
  recommended that Vermont reimburse the Federal Government $40,650 for its share of collected
  AFDC overpayments and implement written policies and procedures to ensure that the Federal
  Government receives its share of AFDC collections. In comments to our draft report, Vermont
  agreed with our finding and recommendations.</p>
