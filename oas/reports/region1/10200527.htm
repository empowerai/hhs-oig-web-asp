<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut (Anthem) terminated from the Medicare program effective June 30, 1999.&nbsp; The
  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) agreed to reimburse Anthem for all allowable, allocable and reasonable
  termination and severance costs incurred in closing out the Medicare contract.&nbsp; In this regard, Anthem claimed $518,049
  for contract termination costs.&nbsp; Our review of these costs disclosed that $104,030 in severance costs and $438 in
  termination expenses were not allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; The unallowable costs were related to excess
  severance costs based on non-Medicare years of service; employees who refused employment offers with the successor contractor;
  severance costs calculated in excess of Anthem&#8217;s company severance policy; and termination costs related to clerical
  errors.&nbsp; We recommended disallowance of the $104,030 in severance costs and the $438 in termination costs.&nbsp; Anthem
  officials agreed with $6,601 of the recommend disallowances.&nbsp; However, Anthem officials did not agree with our recommended
  adjustments related to severance payments based on non-Medicare years of service or the severance payments for the Medicare
  employees who refused employment offers with the successor contractor.&nbsp; We based our recommended disallowances on
  CMS instructions provided to Anthem, which specified that these type of severance costs were not allowable for Medicare
  reimbursement.&nbsp; Accordingly, our recommendations remain valid. </p>
