<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether transitional pass-through payments for drugs, biologicals, and medical
  devices were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; Generally, we found that the hospital was
  reimbursed for pass-through drugs, biologicals, and medical devices in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; However,
  we did identify isolated billing issues dealing with submission of charges, units billed and incorrect coding.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Cape Cod Hospital strengthen its existing controls to ensure that pass-through payments are billed correctly.&nbsp; The
  hospital agreed with our findings and identified steps they have taken, and plan to take, to improve controls over pass-through
  billing. </p>
