<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed the Cooley Dickinson Hospital (Hospital)
  for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; The Hospital relies upon physicians working nearby in the Hospital
  and in its emergency department for direct physician supervision coverage of its outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program.&nbsp; However,
  medical record documentation we examined showed little evidence that a physician personally sees a patient periodically
  throughout the program.&nbsp; In addition, we reviewed a sample of 15 Medicare beneficiaries who received outpatient cardiac
  rehabilitation services during calendar year 2001.&nbsp; We found that medical and billing records provided by the Hospital
  in support of seven beneficiaries receiving cardiac rehabilitation services totaling $1,656 did not always support the
  diagnoses used to establish the patients&#8217; eligibility for cardiac rehabilitation.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital
  work with the FI to ensure that the Hospital&#8217;s outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance
  with Medicare coverage and billing requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital generally agreed with our recommendations.</p>
