<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to evaluate the enrollment and attendance 
  levels of the Head Start program administered by the Community Renewal Team, 
  Inc. (CRT) of Hartford, Connecticut, and the effect these levels had on federal 
  funding. This final report points out that CRT’s actual Head Start enrollment 
  had a total of 924 students less than its expected enrollment for the period 
  reviewed. We estimate these missed enrollment opportunities had an associated 
  value of about $6.5 million. We also noted that CRT’s record keeping and maintenance 
  of program records were inadequate. In addition to the Administration for Children 
  and Families determining a financial adjustment, we recommended that CRT ensure 
  its funded enrollment levels are being met by maintaining and improving recruiting 
  efforts, develop waiting lists at each operating classroom site to ensure vacancies 
  are filled timely, improve its record keeping and maintenance of program records, 
  and comply with special conditions imposed in Head Start grant awards.</p>
