<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">The costs that the State agency claimed for Medicaid 
targeted case management<b> </b>(TCM) services provided by the Maine Bureau of 
Child and Family Services<b> </b>during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were not 
always in accordance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; As a result, the 
State agency overstated TCM costs by a total of $44,213,815 ($29,759,384 Federal 
share).&nbsp; We were unable to express an opinion on the remaining $12,387,285 
($8,327,896 Federal share) claimed.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government 
$29,759,384 in unallowable costs claimed for TCM services; (2) work with the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to 
determine the allowability of the $8,327,896 Federal share on which we were 
unable to express an opinion; (3) identify and refund to the Federal Government 
any TCM costs that represent excessive reimbursement, direct social services, 
and nonreimbursable administrative costs reimbursed after the audit period; and 
(4) establish procedures to ensure that claims for Medicaid TCM reimbursement 
include only allowable and adequately documented TCM costs.&nbsp; The State agency 
disagreed with the findings and recommendations.</p>
