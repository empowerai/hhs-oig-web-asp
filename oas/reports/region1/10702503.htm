<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The State overclaimed $2.7 million in State fiscal years (SFY) 
2003–2005 in high-dollar (more than $3,700) adoption assistance payments for 
ineligible children.&nbsp; Federal adoption assistance payments are available for 
children who meet supplemental security income (SSI) requirements or whose 
family income does not exceed the ceiling for the former Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) program (as in effect on July 16, 1996).&nbsp; Children who 
meet AFDC eligibility requirements qualify for assistance if their removal from 
the home was based on either a voluntary placement agreement or a judicial 
determination demonstrating that continuation in the home would be contrary to 
their welfare.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The State complied with Federal eligibility requirements in claiming high-dollar 
adoption assistance payments totaling $3.4 million for 740 of the 996 children 
whose cases we reviewed for SFY 2003.&nbsp; However, the remaining 256 children with 
payments totaling $954,000 met neither SSI requirements nor all of the other 
requirements for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; The State continued to claim adoption 
assistance payments totaling $1.8 million in SFYs 2004 and 2005 for many of 
these children.<br>
<br>
We recommend that the State (1) make a financial adjustment of $470,000 on its 
next Federal quarterly expenditure report for children who did not meet AFDC 
income eligibility requirements, (2) work with the Administration for Children 
and Families to resolve $2,242,000 in overpayments for children who did not meet 
requirements for voluntary placement agreements or judicial determinations, and 
(3) review adoption assistance payments claimed after our audit period to ensure 
compliance with Federal eligibility requirements.&nbsp; The State concurred with our 
findings and recommendations.</p>
