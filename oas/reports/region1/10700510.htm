<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>: </P>
<P>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; ">
The objective of our review was to determine whether Mutual of Omaha (the Intermediary) paid 
long-term care hospitals' (LTCH) 
claims in accordance with Medicare requirements when beneficiaries had used all 
of their regular covered benefit days.&nbsp; The Intermediary did not always pay LTCH 
claims in accordance with Medicare requirements when the beneficiaries had used 
all of their regular covered benefit days.&nbsp; As a result, the Intermediary made 
overpayments totaling $374,945 for 33 claims to 21 LTCHs for services provided 
from January 1 through May 31, 2003.&nbsp; We recommended that the Intermediary 
recover the $374,945 in overpayments and work with CMS to determine the 
appropriate actions for recovering the portion of the overpayments related to 
the beneficiaries’ coinsurance payments.&nbsp; The Intermediary generally agreed to 
implement our recommendations.</span></P></BODY></HTML>
