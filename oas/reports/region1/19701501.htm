<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Recent amendments to the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act require States to use a portion
  of Care Act funds for AIDS drug assistance programs (ADAPs). Section 340B of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act provides
  for mandatory discount prices for eligible PHS-funded entities electing to purchase drugs directly from manufacturers or
  wholesalers, but participation is voluntary. We analyzed 1996 AIDS drug expenditures for 5 high dollar volume ADAPs who
  chose not to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. We found that the 5 ADAPs could have purchased an additional
  8 percent or $4.4 million of drug therapies had they participated. As a result, there is significant potential for these
  nonparticipating ADAPs to provide additional drug therapies that could improve the quality and length of life for individuals
  with AIDS. In our final report we recommend actions that the Health Resources and Services Administration can take to encourage
  further participation in the 340B drug pricing program. </p>
