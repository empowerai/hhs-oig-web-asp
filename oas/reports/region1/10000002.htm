<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p> 
<p>We reviewed the Connecticut Department of Social Services' 
  (State Agency's) Medicaid reimbursement procedures and controls over Medicaid 
  payments made to outside suppliers for DME when recipients were also receiving 
  skilled nursing care during their stays in a nursing facility. Most DME are 
  considered routine equipment that are normally supplied by the SNF, the cost 
  of which is included in the SNF Medicaid per diem rates. Our review disclosed 
  that the State Agency has established policies that do not allow for Medicaid 
  reimbursement of most DME services to outside suppliers while a recipient is 
  a resident in a SNF. Based on results of a computer match and related payment 
  testing, we found that the State Agency was adhering to its reimbursement policies 
  and that DME was not being inappropriately charged to the Medicaid program. 
  As a result, we have no further recommendations to make on this issue. </p>
