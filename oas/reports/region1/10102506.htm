<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This audit was performed to assess Coastal Enterprises, Inc.'s (CEI) performance in achieving project objectives and
  its accountability for Federal funds.&nbsp; We determined that CEI properly accounted for Federal funds.&nbsp; However,
  we also found that CEI had not achieved the grant’s employment goals by the end of the grant period (60 new jobs, with
  45 targeted to low income people).&nbsp; The main cause of this was that the company CEI originally cited in its grant
  proposal closed down about six months after the beginning of the grant period.&nbsp; By the time a replacement was found
  and approved by ACF, only 4.5 months remained to the original grant period.&nbsp; In that time, Kent, the replacement company
  hired 18 employees, with 14 qualifying as low income.&nbsp; </p>
