<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of Rhode Island’s procedures for identifying and intercepting
  insurance claim payments from non-custodial parents (NCP) with past due child support.&nbsp; Rhode Island’s insurance intercept
  program collected $528,583 from 154 of the 364 insurance payments whose claims matched with the State’s delinquent child
  support database from April 1999 to August 2001.&nbsp; While the remaining 210 matches were still pending at the time of
  our review, we estimate that the State could collect as much as $720,720.&nbsp; In total, the State could collect as much
  as $1,249,303 ($528,583 + $720,720) in child support from its insurance intercept program for the 364 matches.&nbsp; Our
  analysis of amounts collected showed:&nbsp; (i) reduced outstanding child support by 45 percent, (ii) increased financial
  support to NCP children, and (iii) recovered public assistance paid to custodial parents and their children.&nbsp; The
  insurance intercept program also provided the State IV-D agency with current information to locate NCPs, and may increase
  Federal incentive payments. </p>
