<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </P>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The objective of our audit 
was to determine whether Brandeis University (the University) claimed clerical 
and administrative costs and other direct costs under the terms and conditions 
of Department of Health &amp; Human Services grant and contract awards and 
applicable Federal regulations during our audit period of July 1, 2003, through 
June 31, 2005.&nbsp; The University claimed administrative salaries and wages in 
accordance with Federal and University requirements.&nbsp; However, the University 
misclassified a total of $31,303 to National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants 
for books, subscriptions, and public relation costs that should have been 
included in its facilities and administrative (F&amp;A) costs.&nbsp; <a name="OLE_LINK4">
As a result, the University could have overcharged NIH grants $31,303.&nbsp; </a>We 
recommended that the University update its procedures to include books, 
subscriptions, and other supplies as costs claimed under F&amp;A costs unless 
adequately justified, budgeted, and approved by NIH as a direct grant cost and 
work with NIH to resolve the $31,303 in misclassified costs.&nbsp; The University 
generally agreed with our recommendations.</span></p>
