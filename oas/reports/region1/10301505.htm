<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the State: (1) properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism
  preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements; and (2) established
  controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient expenditures of Health Resources and Services Administration Bioterrorism
  Hospital Preparedness Program (the Program) funds.&nbsp; We found that the State generally accounted for the Program funds
  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement and applicable departmental regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; Further,
  State officials have indicated that the Program funding has not been used to supplant any existing state, or local programs.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the State segregate expenditures by phase and priority planning area, and conduct random audits of sub-recipients.&nbsp; The
  State concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
