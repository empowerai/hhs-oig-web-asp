<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Fallon Community Health Plan’s use of its Medicare
  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increases was adequately
  supported and allowable under MMA.&nbsp; In general, Fallon’s use of the $10.9 million MMA
  payment increase was adequately supported and in accord with MMA requirements.&nbsp; The
  exception was that Fallon’s estimate of $160,730 for subsidizing its members’ drug discount
  card purchases exceeded actual purchases.&nbsp; As a result, Fallon received $154,970 more
  than it subsidized.&nbsp; Fallon did not use these excess funds for other allowable purposes
  under MMA.&nbsp; Instead, the funds were deposited into the corporate accounts.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Fallon return the $154,970 or request permission from CMS to use the funds
  in a manner consistent with MMA.&nbsp; Fallon concurred with the finding and indicated it
  would contact CMS.</p>
