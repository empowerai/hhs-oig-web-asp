<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>We identified 122 overpayments greater than 60 days old that Baystate Mary Lane Hospital (the Hospital) should have returned to the Medicaid program.&nbsp;Specifically, the Hospital did not promptly return Medicaid overpayments of $15,738 ($7,869 Federal share) to the Medicaid program in accordance with State Medicaid requirements.&nbsp;These errors occurred because the Hospital did not follow its internal procedures for processing and returning Medicaid overpayments.&nbsp;We recommended that the Hospital return to the Massachusetts Medicaid program overpayments totaling $15,738 ($7,869 Federal share) and continue efforts to identify and return all overpayments to Medicaid in accordance with State requirements.&nbsp;The Hospital agreed substantially with our observations and findings.</p>
