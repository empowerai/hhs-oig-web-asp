<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether high-dollar Medicare payments that Mutual of Omaha
  made to providers for outpatient services were appropriate.&nbsp; Some of the high-dollar
  Medicare outpatient payments were not appropriate.&nbsp; During calendar year 2003, Mutual
  of Omaha made 54 payments of $50,000 or more each for outpatient services. At the start of
  our fieldwork in April 2005: (a) 9 of the payments were correct; (b) 17 of the payments were
  incorrect, and the providers had refunded $5,466,816 in overpayments; and, (c) 28 of the
  payments were incorrect, and the providers had not refunded $2,808,384 in associated overpayments.&nbsp; Contrary
  to Federal guidance, the providers in all 45 (17 plus 28) instances inappropriately overstated
  the units of service.</p>
<p>We recommended that Mutual of Omaha: (1) inform us of the status of the recovery of the
  $2,808,384 in overpayments that our audit identified, (2) identify and recover additional
  overpayments made on high-dollar outpatient claims paid after calendar year 2003, and (3)
  use the results of this audit in its provider education activities.&nbsp; Mutual of Omaha
  agreed with our recommendations.</p>
