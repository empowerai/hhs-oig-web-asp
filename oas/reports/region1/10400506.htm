<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Contrary to the Social Security Act, St. Mary&#8217;s Regional Medical Center included 1,341 Medicare Part
  A paid days in the Medicaid fraction of its disproportionate share hospital (DSH) calculation.&nbsp; As a result, we determined
  that its DSH reimbursement amount was overstated by $433,502.&nbsp; Section 1886(d)(5)(F)(vi)(II) of the Social Security
  Act defines the Medicaid fraction of the DSH calculation as the fraction, the numerator of which is the number of patient
  days for which the patient was eligible for Medicaid <i>but not entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A</i>, and the
  denominator as the total number of patient days for the same period.&nbsp; We recommend that St. Mary&#8217;s Regional Medical
  Center resubmit its FY 2002 Medicare cost report excluding the 1,341 Medicare Part A paid days from the Medicaid fraction
  and establish procedures to ensure that in the future only allowable days are included in the DSH reimbursement calculation.</p>
