<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether New Hampshire’s Department of Health and Human Services
  (the State agency) complied with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 and
  ACF guidance in claiming Federal reimbursement for the costs of foster care and adoption
  assistance training.&nbsp; The State agency did not fully comply with guidance in claiming
  costs for reimbursement.&nbsp; Specifically, the State agency did not allocate training costs
  between Federal and State programs.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency overstated Federal
  claims for training costs during State fiscal years 2001 through 2003 by $1.76 million (Federal
  share).&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency make a financial adjustment of $1.76 million
  on its next Federal Quarterly Report of Expenditures and ensure that it follows OMB Circular
  A-87 and ACF’s policy for allocating training costs.&nbsp; The State agency disagreed with
  our recommendations.</p>
