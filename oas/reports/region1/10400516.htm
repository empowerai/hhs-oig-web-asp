<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital did not comply with Medicare
    law, regulations, and guidelines for claiming organ acquisition costs in the preparation of its Medicare Part A cost
    report and received excess Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; Specifically, the hospital
    did not have systems in place to accumulate certain costs of organ acquisition separate from the costs of post-transplant
    and other hospital activities, and reduce laboratory charges and related-party charges to cost on its Medicare cost report.&nbsp; As
    a result, the hospital claimed $1,041,718 in unallowable costs, resulting in Medicare overpayments of $489,618, and $2,299,519
in unsupported cost, resulting in Medicare overpayments of $949,296.</p>
