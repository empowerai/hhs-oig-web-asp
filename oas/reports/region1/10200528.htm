<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>:</p>
<p>This report presents the results of our audit of outpatient 
  claims with outlier payments submitted by the Baystate Medical Center (Hospital) 
  under the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS).&nbsp; The objective 
  of our audit was to determine whether outpatient claims with outlier payments 
  were billed in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; For the 
  period August 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001, we reviewed a sample of 38 such 
  claims, totaling $145,736, and found that 37 claims were incorrectly billed.&nbsp; 
  Specifically, the billing errors primarily included claims with incorrect ambulatory 
  payment classification codes, as well as claims with incorrect units and clerical 
  errors.&nbsp; As a result, we identified both overpayments and underpayments 
  resulting in a net Medicare overpayment to the Hospital of $7,939.&nbsp; We 
  recommended that the Hospital strengthen its policies and procedures with regard 
  to billing for outpatient services under OPPS and to initiate adjustments with 
  the Medicare Fiscal Intermediary for the $7,939 in overpayments identified through 
  this audit.&nbsp; The Hospital agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
