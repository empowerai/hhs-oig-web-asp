<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>We found that the State of Vermont improperly claimed Medicaid costs related to skilled professional medical personnel
  totaling $262,219 for Federal fiscal year 2003.&nbsp; The State did not have adequate procedures in place to ensure that
  only eligible individuals and allowable expenses were claimed for enhanced Federal funding in accordance with Federal regulations
  or that all costs claimed were appropriate charges to the Medicaid program. We recommended that the State refund $262,219
  for the Federal share of unallowable Medicaid costs and implement procedures to ensure that future claims are eligible
  for the enhanced Federal funding rate.&nbsp; State officials agreed with our recommendations.&nbsp; </p>
