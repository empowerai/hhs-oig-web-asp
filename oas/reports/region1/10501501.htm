<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether subaward costs claimed by Yale University (the University)
  under a University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) grant from the National Institutes
  of Health (NIH) were in accordance with the terms of the subaward and applicable Federal
  regulations. &nbsp;The University claimed $193,779 in costs that did not comply with OMB
  Circulars A-21 and subaward terms. &nbsp;In addition, the Principal Investigator failed to
  provide the 25 percent level of effort proposed in the University’s subaward application. &nbsp;We
  recommended that the University (1) verify that cost transfers are adequately explained and
  documented, (2) improve procedures for direct charging of costs and comply with procedures
  for confirming effort reports, and (3) ensure that levels of efforts are satisfied. &nbsp;Because
  the University received its funds through a subaward from UMMS rather than directly from
  NIH, we will recommend under separate cover that UMMS reimburse NIH for remaining unallowable
  subaward costs totaling $193,779. &nbsp;The University acknowledges the $78,965 in disallowances
  and disagreed with the remaining $114,814.</p>
