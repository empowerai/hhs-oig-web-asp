<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Multicultural AIDS Coalition (MAC) has generally met its overall performance expectations but needs to improve its
  financial management system to ensure grant funds are used for the intended purpose. We specifically found that:&nbsp; (1)
  MAC allocated personnel costs to federal grants based on budget estimates because it had not developed a system for allocating
  salaries and wages to federal grants and contracts based on personnel activity reports for each employee; and (2) two MAC
  employees, whose salaries were paid with CDC funds, appeared to be involved in lobbying activities—an unallowable charge
  under federal regulations.&nbsp; We recommended that MAC continue its efforts to:&nbsp; implement its revised system for
  allocating personnel costs and periodically monitor the personnel costs charged to federal awards; and develop written
  policies and procedures addressing the types of costs and activities that are unallowable as charges to federal grants.</p>
