<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Office of Medicaid's (State agency) claim for
  selected administrative costs incurred by the University of Massachusetts met applicable
  Medicaid program requirements.&nbsp; Our review of administrative claims data for State fiscal
  years 2003 and 2004 disclosed that $614,022 Federal share was ineligible for reimbursement.&nbsp; These
  unallowable claims were related to contingency fee payments, excessive payments to a subcontractor,
  and salaries.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency refund $614,022 to the Federal government; establish
  procedures to ensure compliance with Federal regulations regarding contingency fee payments,
  subcontractor costs, and salaries claimed for Medicaid reimbursement; and establish and enforce
  proper internal controls over timekeeping procedures for salaries claimed for Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; The
  State agency agreed with our procedural recommendations and agreed to refund unallowable
  costs of $480,853 (Federal share) related to contingency fee payments and subcontractor costs.&nbsp; The
  State agency disagreed with our recommendation to refund $133,169 (Federal share) related
  to salaries.</p>
