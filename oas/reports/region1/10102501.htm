<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if retroactive foster care adjustments were supported by Federal regulations.
  The Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) claimed a total of $45.2 million ($22.6 million Federal share)
  in retroactive foster care adjustments for the quarters December 1996 to September 1999.&nbsp; The DCF was not able to
  provide required support for $3.92 million ($1.96 million Federal share) in retroactive foster care adjustments made under
  its prior computer system for quarters December 1996 through December 1997.&nbsp; Also, DCF was unable to provide individual
  retroactive adjustments to support costs totaling $22.54 million ($11.27 million Federal share) for the first quarter under
  its current system.&nbsp; We recommended that: (1) retroactive adjustments continue to be supported by detailed reports
  and that DCF incorporate this requirement in their written procedures; (2) the Federal share of $1.96 million claimed under
  the prior system be returned to ACF; and (3) the DCF work with ACF to reach a workable solution for the $22.54 million
  ($11.27 million Federal share) that we set aside. </p>
