<p>Our objective 
was to determine whether the Connecticut Department of Social Services (the 
State agency) properly claimed Federal Medicaid funding at the enhanced rate for 
eligible skilled professional medical personnel. &nbsp;For Federal fiscal year 2003, 
the State agency claimed enhanced Federal reimbursement of $1,911,380.&nbsp; Before 
our on-site review, the State agency processed adjustments totaling $742,517 to 
deduct costs that were not allowable for enhanced Federal financial 
participation. The remaining $1,168,863 that the State agency claimed in 
enhanced reimbursement for skilled professional medical personnel was allowable 
at the enhanced rate.&nbsp; As a result, we have no further recommendations.</p>
