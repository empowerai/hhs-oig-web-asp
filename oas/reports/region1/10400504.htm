<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Weldon Rehabilitation Hospital (Weldon) billed
  inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) claims for fiscal year 2003 in compliance with Medicare prospective payment system
  (PPS) regulations.&nbsp; We found that Weldon had established adequate procedures for completing and transmitting patient
  assessment instruments.&nbsp; However, we found that Weldon billed 49 claims that were not in compliance with Medicare
  PPS regulations.&nbsp; As a result, the hospital received Medicare overpayments totaling $202,872.&nbsp; Overpayments occurred
  because Weldon did not:&nbsp; (1) establish adequate controls for properly coding patient status; and (2) adhere to existing
  controls for billing interrupted stays.&nbsp; We recommended that Weldon: (1) implement policies and procedures for correct
  coding of patient status codes and provide training and internal monitoring to ensure successful implementation; (2) monitor
  adherence to its existing controls for billing interrupted stays; and (3) refund overpayments.&nbsp; Weldon agreed with
  our findings.</p>
