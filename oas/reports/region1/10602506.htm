<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government shares in the States&rsquo; costs of adoption assistance payments for children who meet supplemental security income (SSI) requirements or other specific requirements.&nbsp;Our objective was to determine whether the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (the State agency) complied with Federal eligibility requirements in claiming adoption assistance payments for Federal reimbursement.</p>
<p>The State agency complied with Federal eligibility requirements in claiming adoption assistance payments for 702 of the 1,000 children whose cases we reviewed for State fiscal year (SFY) 2002.&nbsp;However, the remaining 298 children did not meet Federal eligibility requirements.&nbsp;None of these children met the SSI requirements, nor did any of them meet all of the other requirements for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp;The State agency continued to claim adoption assistance payments for all 298 ineligible children in SFY 2003 and for 294 of these children in SFY 2004.&nbsp;As a result, the State agency overclaimed $4.3 million (Federal share) in adoption assistance payments for SFYs 2002 through 2004. </p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency make a financial adjustment of $2.8 million on its next Federal Quarterly Report of Expenditures for children who did not meet income eligibility requirements, work with the Administration for Children and Families to resolve $1.5 million in overpayments for children who did not meet judicial determination requirements, and conduct reviews of adoption assistance payments claimed after our review to ensure compliance with Federal reimbursement requirements.&nbsp;The State agency concurred with our recommendations.</p>
