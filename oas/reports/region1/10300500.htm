<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether home health agencies (HHA)
  were billing for services that were preceded by an inpatient hospital discharge
  in compliance with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; Medicare prospective payments system
  regulations provide for a higher payment to HHAs for home health services for which
  the beneficiary was not discharged from an inpatient hospital within 14 days of
  the HHA episode.&nbsp; We identified 6,388 claims in fiscal year 2001 for which
  it appears HHAs received a higher payment even though the beneficiary was discharged
  from an inpatient hospital within 14 days preceding the home health services.&nbsp; Based
  on a stratified random sample of 200 claims, we estimate about $1.9 million in
  overpayments to HHAs for the 6,388 claims.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments
  and internal control improvements, which were generally concurred with by Associated
  Hospital Service, the regional home health intermediary.</p>
