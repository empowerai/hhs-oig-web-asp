<P><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></P>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether
    Hartford Hospital (the hospital) reported fiscal year (FY) 2001 Medicare cost report wage data in
    compliance with Medicare <a> regulations and guidance</a>.&nbsp; We found that the hospital did not
    fully comply with Medicare regulations and guidance for reporting wage data in its FY 2001 Medicare
    cost report.&nbsp; Specifically, the hospital reported wage data that included: (1) unreasonable
    pension costs of $3,651,298; (2) unallowable contract labor services totaling $1,039,286 in salaries
    and 27,456 in hours; and (3) overstated overhead hours and employees’ severance pay without the related
    hours that understated wages by $149,674 and hours by 25,499.&nbsp; These errors occurred because
    the hospital did not sufficiently review and reconcile wage data to ensure that all amounts reported
    were accurate and supportable, and in compliance with Medicare regulations and guidance.&nbsp; As
    a result, the hospital overstated its wage data by $4,540,910 and its average hourly wage rate by
    about 2 percent for the FY 2001 Medicare cost report period.&nbsp; We recommended the hospital strengthen
    its financial reporting controls to ensure compliance with Medicare regulations and guidance.&nbsp; The
    hospital did not agree with our first two findings and did not comment on our third finding.</p>
