<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
  Number 106 by educational institutions (schools) and gateway.html institutions (gateway.htmls). The objective of our review
  was to determine the effect of FASB 106 on the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 (A-21), Cost Principles
  for Educational Institutions and OMB Circular A-122 (A-122), Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations. Our review disclosed
  that the effect of FASB 106 on PRB costs could materially increase the amount claimed for reimbursement by schools and
  gateway.htmls conducting federally sponsored research. Prior to FASB 106, financial reporting under generally accepted
  accounting principles (GAAP) recognized PRB costs when they were paid. Under FASB 106 , the expected cost of providing
  PRBs to current employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents are accrued. As such, institutions are now required
  under GAAP to report accrued PRB costs for current and retired employees as a liability on their financial statements. </p>
