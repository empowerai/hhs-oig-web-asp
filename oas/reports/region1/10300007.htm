<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objectives of this audit were: (1) verify the total reported uncollected drug rebates for the State of Maine as of
  June 30, 2002, (2) determine whether the State agency has established adequate internal controls with regard to the Medicaid
  drug rebate program, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken by the State agency to resolve outstanding
  disputes.&nbsp; We found that the State agency had not established adequate procedures to ensure that invoiced rebates
  or accounting adjustments are made to quarterly reports to the Centers for Mediare and Medicaid Services (CMS); all disputed
  rebate amounts are followed-up with the manufacturer in a timely manner and interest on unpaid or late drug rebate amounts
  is properly assessed.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency; ensure procedures are established to provide accurate
  pending rebate amounts and properly present drug rebate receivables in its quarterly reports to CMS, resolve disputed items
  in a timely manner in accordance with CMS guidelines, and collect interest on any disputed or unpaid drug rebate amounts
  as well as late payments. The auditee concurred with our findings.</p>
