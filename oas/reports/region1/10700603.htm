<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program, the Centers for 
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services makes subsidy payments to employer and union 
sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans.&nbsp; Blue Cross Blue Shield 
of Massachusetts, Inc.’s employment-based retiree health coverage met the 
requirements to be considered a qualified retiree prescription drug plan.&nbsp; 
However, Blue Cross Blue Shield did not establish sufficient controls to prevent 
incorrect retiree drug costs from being reported under the program.&nbsp; Using a 
judgmental sample that contained retirees at high risk of having overstated 
costs, we found that Blue Cross Blue Shield had overstated costs by $12,798 for 
6 of the 50 retirees sampled.&nbsp; In addition, Blue Cross Blue Shield did not 
establish adequate administrative safeguards over retiree data. </p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that Blue Cross Blue Shield (1) revise its 2006 plan year cost report at 
reconciliation to eliminate the $12,798 in overstated costs, (2) work with its 
vendor to ensure that all costs that its vendor submitted for plan year 2006 
were incurred for qualifying covered retirees within both the retiree’s plan 
coverage dates and the approved subsidy period, (3) establish procedures to 
ensure that costs that its vendor submits in future years are incurred for 
qualifying covered retirees within both the retiree’s plan coverage dates and 
the approved subsidy period, and (4) follow the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services’ procedures to ensure that only eligible employees have access to the 
Retiree Drug Subsidy program secure Web site.&nbsp; Blue Cross Blue Shield agreed 
with our findings and recommendations.</span><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
