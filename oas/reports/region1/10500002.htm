<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if the Vermont Agency of Human Services, Office of Vermont
  Health Access (the State agency) properly claimed Federal financial participation for claims
  related to family planning services in accordance with applicable Federal regulations and
  the Medicaid State Plan. From October 2003 through September 2004, the State agency improperly
  claimed a total of $323,367 for Federal Medicaid reimbursement for family planning services.&nbsp; The
  State agency claimed these costs because it did not reconcile the quarterly claims for enhanced
  reimbursement with paid claim activity for such services and because it did not have adequate
  procedures in place to ensure that only eligible family planning services were claimed for
  enhanced Federal funding.&nbsp; We recommended that the State refund $323,367 for the Federal
  share of unallowable Medicaid costs and implement procedures to ensure that future claims
  are eligible for the enhanced Federal funding rate.&nbsp; State officials agreed with our
  recommendations.</p>
