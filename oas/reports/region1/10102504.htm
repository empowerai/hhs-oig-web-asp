<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our review of the Washington County Youth Service Bureau and Boys &amp; Girls Club’s (Washington County) administration
  of the Administration for Children and Families’ Runaway and Homeless Street Outreach Program (SOP) disclosed that the
  grant award goals and objectives are being met in a satisfactory manner.&nbsp; In addition, Washington County has established
  an adequate system of financial management controls to properly account for and report on SOP expenditures.&nbsp; We did
  find some inaccuracies in the number of program participants reported in some quarterly Program Progress Reports for certain
  program activities.&nbsp; However, Washington County officials took immediate action to establish a formalized policy to
  correct this situation.</p>
