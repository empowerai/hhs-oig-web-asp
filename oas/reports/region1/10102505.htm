<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that the Urban League properly accounted for Federal funds.&nbsp; However, the Urban League should
  strive to improve its processes for setting, documenting, and achieving adoption opportunity program goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
  Urban League did not:&nbsp; (1) document the achievement of its goal to reach 1,200 people interested in adopting; (2)
  achieve its goal to recruit 40 Black, Hispanic, and other ethnic and racially mixed families and individuals to become
  adoptive parents for minority children; and (3) achieve its goal to place 40 minority children (ages birth to 16 years,
  with emphasis on children over 10 years old and sibling group) in these homes for each project year.&nbsp; Our review of
  program operations determined that the Urban League did not maintain an accurate record keeping system for recruiting and
  tracking minority families interested in adopting minority children.&nbsp; The Urban League could improve its performance
  management on current and future projects by:&nbsp; (1) assuring that all policies and procedures are put in writing;&nbsp; (2)
  making more and better use of computers to monitor and to document program activities, such as goal-setting, recruiting
  interested families, screening applications, evaluating residences, training families, and tracking the status of potential
  adoption placements; and (3) standardizing processes and forms to provide better flow and tracking of cases from initial
  contact through completion.&nbsp; </p>
