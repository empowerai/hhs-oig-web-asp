<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for school-based 
  health services by the Springfield Public Schools through the Commonwealth of 
  Massachusetts were reasonable, allowable and adequately supported in accordance 
  with the terms of the state Medicaid plan and applicable federal regulations.&nbsp; 
  The audit period included Medicaid payments made during the period July 1, 1999 
  through June 30, 2000.</p>
<p>We found Springfield Public Schools inappropriately claimed the cost of school-based 
  health services when documentation was inadequate, providers did not have required 
  qualifications, students were absent, and for days when schools were not open 
  to students.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that the Springfield Public Schools 
  were overpaid at least $574,034.&nbsp; We made procedural recommendation to 
  Springfield Public Schools to address these issues.&nbsp; We also recommended 
  that Springfield Public Schools refund amounts that were inappropriately paid 
  by the Medicaid program.&nbsp; Springfield Public Schools officials disagreed 
  with the findings and recommendations regarding documentation of services and 
  provider qualifications.&nbsp; Springfield Public Schools generally agreed with 
  the finding and recommendations concerning attendance.</p>
