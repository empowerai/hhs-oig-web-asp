<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Yale-New Haven did not comply with Medicare laws, regulations, and guidelines in the preparation of
  its Medicare cost report and received excess reimbursement for organ acquisition activities.&nbsp; Specifically, Yale-New
  Haven claimed costs associated with post-transplant activities. This occurred because Yale-New Haven did not have a system
  to identify salaries related to post-transplant activities.&nbsp; As a result, Yale-New Haven claimed, as organ acquisition
  costs, $1,572,795 of salary costs that were not properly supported with current, accurate documentation that differentiated
  between pre-transplant and post-transplant activities as required by <a>Medicare</a>.&nbsp; This resulted in a Medicare
  overpayment of $793,482. </p>
