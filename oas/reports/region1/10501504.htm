<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether subaward costs claimed by Roger Williams Hospital
  (the Hospital) under the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) prime grant no.1
  PO1 HL56920-05 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were allowable under the terms
  of the subaward and applicable Federal regulations. &nbsp;We identified $55,746 in costs
  that did not comply with Federal regulations and subaward terms. Of this total, $53,655 was
  in unallowable cost transfers and related fringe and indirect costs and $2,091 was in unsupported
  animal care charges and related indirect costs. &nbsp;We recommended that the Hospital (i)
  comply with Federal requirements for ensuring that cost transfers are adequately explained
  and documented and (ii) revise its procedures to ensure that animal care charges can be identified
  to a specific project or account.&nbsp; Because the Hospital received its funds through a
  subaward from UMMS rather than directly from NIH, we will recommend under separate cover
  that UMMS reimburse NIH for unallowable subaward costs totaling $55,746. &nbsp;The Hospital
  has initiated actions to comply with the report’s recommendations.</p>
