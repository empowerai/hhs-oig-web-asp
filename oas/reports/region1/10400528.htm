<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether carriers made inappropriate Part
  B payments for outpatient radiology services provided to Medicare beneficiaries during inpatient
  stays at prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals.&nbsp; During calendar years 2001–2003,
  carriers inappropriately made Part B payments for 100,034 outpatient radiology services provided
  to PPS hospital inpatients.&nbsp;  Rather
  than billing the hospitals for these services, radiology suppliers billed the carriers and
  received separate payments.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS:&nbsp; (1)
    instruct the Medicare carriers to recover the $20 million in potential overpayments identified
    in our review and monitor the recovery of those overpayments, (2) establish prepayment
    controls to detect and prevent separate payments for Medicare Part B radiology services
    provided to beneficiaries during inpatient stays in PPS hospitals and/or develop postpayment
    review procedures to identify suppliers that submit and receive payments for inappropriate
    billings, and (3) alert the Medicare carriers to the most common types of payment errors
    and help them educate radiology suppliers about such improper billings.&nbsp; CMS generally
    agreed with our recommendations.</p>
