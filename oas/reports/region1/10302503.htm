<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State complied
    with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 and Administration for Children and Families (ACF) guidance
    in claiming Federal reimbursement for costs for foster care and adoption assistance training.&nbsp; The State did not
    comply with OMB Circular A-87 and ACF guidelines.&nbsp; Specifically, the State (1) did not allocate perservice training
    costs between the Federal and State programs, (2) incorrectly calculated the Federal share of indirect costs, and (3)
    inaccurately reported the amount claimed for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; As a result, the State misstated Federal claims
    for training costs during State fiscal years 2001 through 2003.&nbsp; Identified errors resulted in $4.3 million in overstatements
    and $1.3 million in understatements, for a net Federal overstatement of $3 million.&nbsp; We recommended a financial
    adjustment for $3 million and procedural improvements.&nbsp; The State concurred with our recommendations.</p>
