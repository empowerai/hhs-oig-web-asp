<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the State recorded and reported hospital preparedness
  program funds awarded, expended, obligated, and unobligated by priority planning area in accordance
  with its cooperative agreement with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).&nbsp; The
  State recorded and reported hospital preparedness program funds by priority planning area in accordance
  with the cooperative agreement with HRSA.&nbsp; We found no evidence of any unreasonable, unnecessary,
  unallocable, or unallowable costs.&nbsp; In addition, we found no evidence of supplanting of State
  or local expenditures with Federal hospital preparedness program funds.&nbsp; We noted that, as of
  August 30, 2004, the State had cumulative unobligated funds totaling $8,653,180, or 65 per cent of
  the $13,395858 awarded.&nbsp; We recommended that the State monitor its hospital preparedness funding
  to minimize unobligated fund balances and to ensure that program goals are met in a timely manner.</p>
