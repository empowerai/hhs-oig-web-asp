<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p> The objective of this review was to determine whether outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed in accordance
  with Medicare laws and regulations. We judgmentally selected 33 claims with outlier payments of $208,250. We found overpayments
  of $59,470 were made for 28 of the selected claims because Eastern Maine Medical Center (EMMC) did not bill for the correct
  number of units of drugs and biologicals. We found that a conversion error in EMMC's billing system when outpatient prospective
  payment system was implemented resulted in unwarranted or excessive outlier payments. Specifically, a programming change
  designed to convert operating room units from multiple units to one unit was inadvertently applied to all line items reducing
  the line item reimbursement. This reduction in line item reimbursement, combined with charges being recorded in full, generated
  outlier reimbursement in excess of the appropriate reimbursement amount.&nbsp; The EMMC concurred with our findings and
  recommendations.</p>
