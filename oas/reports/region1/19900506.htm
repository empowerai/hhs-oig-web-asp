<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that, based on a statistical sample, approximately $6.1 million was improperly paid to hospital
  laboratories for services provided to ESRD beneficiaries during calendar years 1995 through 1997. Specifically, hospital
  labs were reimbursed separately for services which were included in the dialysis facility's composite rate. Also, contrary
  to the 50 percent rule, separate payments were made for additional profile tests performed in conjunction with the monthly
  testing included in the composite rate. We recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) require the
  fiscal intermediaries to provide education to ESRD providers and hospital laboratories explaining proper billing practices,
  including which lab tests are included in the composite rate, the frequencies at which these tests are included, and the
  50 percent rule. We also recommended that HCFA monitor providers' billing for lab tests outside the composite rate and
  conduct detailed post-payment reviews to determine if reimbursement was proper. If implemented we estimate future savings
  of more than $2 million per year. The HCFA generally concurred with our recommendations. </p>
