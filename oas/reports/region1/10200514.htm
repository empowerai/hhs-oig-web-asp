<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report presents the results of our review of medical education payments
  claimed by the Baystate Medical Center for the fiscal year (FY) ended September
  30,1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of our review was to determine the accuracy
  of resident Full Time Equivalent (FTE) counts used to calculate direct graduate
  medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments.&nbsp; We
  found that the Hospital’s controls over the proper claiming of resident FTEs
  were generally adequate with the exception of 6.4 GME FTEs and 5.8 IME FTEs
  that did not meet Medicare criteria for reimbursement.&nbsp; The effect of
  these errors did not reduce the FTE counts below established limits on FTEs
  allowable to be claimed.&nbsp; Therefore, there was no adverse financial impact
  to the Hospital’s FY 1999 GME/IME reimbursement.&nbsp; However, we believe
  such adjustments should be made and corrective policies be put in place in
  order to provide accurate historical information used in future years’ reimbursements.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the Hospital strengthen its procedures to ensure that resident
  FTE counts are computed in accordance with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; The
  Hospital agreed with our findings and recommendation.</p>
