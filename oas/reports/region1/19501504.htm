<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report provides the results of our review made to determine whether the Boston Eligible Metropolitan
  Area (EMA) and its service providers ensured that all clients of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency
  Act of 1990 (CARE) were individuals who had AIDS or were members of their families. We found that two of the three service
  providers reviewed did not have documentation regarding HIV disease for 102 of the 113 cases we reviewed. This occurred
  because the Boston EMA had not given guidance to service providers for the implementation of a system to ensure that all
  CARE Act clients were individuals with HIV disease or members of their families. Among other things, we are recommending
  that the Boston EMA provide such guidance. Both the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Boston EMA acknowledged
  our findings and agreed to effectuate corrective action. </p>
