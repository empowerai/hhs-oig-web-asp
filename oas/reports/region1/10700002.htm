<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>
<P><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Our objective 
was to determine whether the credit balances recorded in Baystate Franklin 
Medical Center’s (the Hospital) accounting records for inpatient and outpatient 
services for Medicaid beneficiaries represented overpayments more than 60 days 
old that the Hospital should have returned to the Medicaid program.&nbsp; We 
identified 306 overpayments more than 60 days old that the Hospital should have 
returned to the Medicaid program.&nbsp; As a result, the Hospital did not promptly 
return Medicaid overpayments totaling $80,272 ($40,136 Federal share) to the 
Medicaid program in accordance with State Medicaid requirements.&nbsp; We recommended 
that the Hospital return to the Massachusetts Medicaid program overpayments 
totaling $80,272 ($40,136 Federal share) and continue efforts to identify and 
return all overpayments to Medicaid in accordance with State requirements.&nbsp; 
The Hospital agreed substantially with our 
observations and findings.</span></P></BODY></HTML>
