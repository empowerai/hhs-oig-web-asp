<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p> 
<p>The objectives of this audit were to verify the total
  reported uncollected drug rebates for the State of Rhode Island as of June
  30, 2002, and determine whether the State agency has established adequate internal
  controls with regard to the reported drug rebates uncollected balance and disputed items.&nbsp; We
  found that quarterly reports could not be reconciled to State records that
  resulted in a difference of $4.7 million for the total uncollected drug rebate amount, and
  there were approximately $570,000 of uncollected disputed items for the period
  January 1994 through December 2001 that had not been resolved in accordance
  with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the State agency reconcile State records to the amount reported
  to CMS, establish written procedures to recording drug rebate transactions,
  and resolve disputed items.&nbsp; The auditee concurred with our findings and
will take appropriate actions to implement our recommendations.</p>
