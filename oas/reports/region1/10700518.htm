<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoHeader">Physicians did not always correctly code the place of 
service on claims submitted to and paid by First Coast Service Options, Inc. 
(First Coast), during 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; Physicians are required to identify the 
place of service on the health insurance claim forms that they submit to 
Medicare Part B carriers to ensure that Medicare does not duplicate payment to 
the physician and the facility.&nbsp; Physicians correctly coded the claims for 15 of 
the 100 sampled services.&nbsp; However, physicians incorrectly coded the claims for 
85 sampled services by using the office place-of-service code for services that 
were actually performed in outpatient hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers.&nbsp; 
Based on these sample results, we estimated that First Coast overpaid physicians 
$1.5 million for incorrectly coded services provided during the 2-year period 
that ended December 31, 2005.<br>
<br>
We recommended that First Coast (1) recover the $2,900 in overpayments for the 
sampled services,<a name="tm_67112672"> </a><a name="tm_67113142">(2) </a>review 
our information on the nonsampled services to identify services<b> </b>estimated 
at $1.5 million that were potentially billed with incorrect place-of-service 
codes and work with the physicians who provided the services to recover any 
overpayments, (3) reemphasize to physicians and their billing agents the 
importance of correctly coding the place of service and the need for internal 
controls to prevent Medicare billings with incorrect place-of-service codes, and 
(4) work with the program safeguard contractor to develop a data match that will 
identify physician services at high risk for place-of-service miscoding and 
recover any identified overpayments.&nbsp; First Coast agreed with our 
recommendations.</p>
