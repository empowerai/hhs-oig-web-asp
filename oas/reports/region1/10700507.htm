<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether inpatient 
psychiatric facilities (IPF) properly submitted Medicare claims paid by 
Palmetto GBA (Palmetto) for transition stays.&nbsp; IPFs did not always properly bill 
claims paid by Palmetto for transition stays in 2005.&nbsp; Specifically, for 77 of 
the 100 claims that we sampled (from the population of 226 claims), IPFs 
incorrectly split the beneficiary’s stay by submitting 1 claim under the Tax 
Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 payment period and a second claim 
under the prospective payment period, rather than properly submitting 1 claim 
for the entire inpatient stay.&nbsp; Based on our sample results, we estimate that 
Palmetto overpaid IPFs a total of $706,285 for incorrectly billed Medicare 
claims for transition stays in <a>2005</a>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that Palmetto (1) make the appropriate 
adjustments to the sampled claims that resulted in overpayments of $312,516, (2) 
review our information on the additional 126 claims with potential overpayments 
estimated at $393,769 ($706,285 less $312,516) and work with the IPFs that 
provided the services to recover any overpayments, and (3) analyze postpayment 
data from IPF claims submitted after our review to ensure that the claims were 
billed properly and paid correctly by <a>Palmetto</a>. 
&nbsp;Palmetto agreed with our findings and recommendations and stated that it was 
taking appropriate <a>action</a>.</p>
