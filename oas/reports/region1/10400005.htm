<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to evaluate whether the State agency had established adequate accountability and internal
  controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; For State fiscal year 2002, we found that the State agency did not
  establish accounting procedures and internal controls to monitor the collection of interest due from manufacturers and
  to reconcile and age drug rebate balances on the Form CMS 64.9R report.&nbsp; As a result, information contained on the
  quarterly Form CMS 64.9Rs during our audit period was not always accurate.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency establish
  policies and procedures for reconciling and aging its pending drug rebate amounts on the Form CMS 64.9R and for the proper
  monitoring and collection of interest due from manufacturers.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our recommendations.</p>
