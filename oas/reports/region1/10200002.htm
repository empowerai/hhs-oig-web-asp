<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for school-based
  health services by the Lynn Public Schools through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
  were reasonable, allowable and adequately supported in accordance with the
  terms of the state Medicaid plan and applicable federal regulations. The audit
  period included Medicaid payments made during the period July 1, 1999 through
  June 30, 2000.</p>
<p>We found that the Lynn Public Schools inappropriately claimed the cost of
  school-based health services when documentation was inadequate, providers did
  not have the required qualifications, the student did not have a valid individualized
  education plan (IEP), the incorrect prototype was used and the school was closed
  for in-service days. As a result, we estimate that the Lynn Public Schools
  were overpaid at least $250,901. The Lynn Public Schools also received payments
  totaling $8,510 for days when the schools were not open (vacations, holidays,
  etc.). We made procedural recommendations to Lynn Public Schools to address
  these issues. We also recommended that the Lynn Public Schools refund amounts
  that were inappropriately paid by the Medicaid program.&nbsp; Lynn Public Schools
  officials disagreed with the finding and recommendations regarding documentation
  of services, provider qualifications, and IEPs. They agreed with the findings
  and recommendations regarding prototypes and days when the schools were closed.</p>
