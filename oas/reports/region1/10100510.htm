<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if Massachusetts Fresenius providers have established adequate internal
  controls and procedures to ensure that claims for EPOGEN (EPO) are supported and billed in accordance with Medicare rules
  and regulations.&nbsp; Based on a random sample of 200 claims valued at $249,528, we did identify portions of 23 claims
  totaling $3,585 not eligible for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; In addition, we addressed our concerns with respect to the
  use of EPO protocols as standing physician orders and with physicians not signing off EPO dosage changes.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Fresenius (1) strengthen their internal controls and procedures to ensure that the claims submitted for EPO are supported
  and billed in accordance with Medicare rules and regulations, and (2) resolve with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
  Services and the Associated Hospital Service as to what physician documentation is required when using a protocol containing
  an algorithm as a standing physician order for a nurse to administer EPO.&nbsp; </p>
