<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For calendar years (CY) 1999–2002, before Common Working 
File edits were fully operational, Medicare Part B made $100.8 million in 
potential overpayments to suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, 
orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) on behalf of beneficiaries in Part A-covered 
skilled nursing facility stays.&nbsp; For CY 2003, after the edits were fully 
operational, OIG’s computer match identified potential DMEPOS overpayments 
valued at $15.4 million.&nbsp; A statistical sample showed that the durable medical 
equipment regional carriers (DMERC) had not recovered approximately 69 percent 
of these overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, OIG estimated that the DMERCs had not 
recovered $11.2 million of the $15.4 million in potential CY 2003 overpayments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">OIG recommended that CMS (1) direct the DMERCs to review 
the $100.8 million in potential overpayments for CYs 1999–2002 and make 
appropriate recoveries, (2) direct the DMERCs to initiate recovery of the 
estimated $11.2 million in CY 2003 overpayments, and (3) ensure that all DMERCs 
have established proper controls to recover overpayments that the Common Working 
File edits identify.&nbsp; CMS concurred with the recommendations.</p>
