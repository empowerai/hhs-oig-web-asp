<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for school-based health services by the Boston Public
  Schools through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were reasonable, allowable and adequately supported in accordance with
  the terms of the state Medicaid plan and applicable federal regulations.&nbsp; The audit period included Medicaid payments
  made during the period July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000. </p>
<p>Boston Public Schools claimed the cost of school-based health services although documentation was inadequate, providers
  did not have required qualifications, the Individual Education Plan was invalid, students were absent, and for days when
  schools were not open to students.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that the Boston Public Schools were overpaid at least
  $1,240,526.&nbsp; We made procedural recommendation to address these issues.&nbsp; We also recommended that Boston Public
  Schools refund amounts that were inappropriately paid by the Medicaid program.&nbsp; Boston Public Schools officials disagreed
  with the findings and recommendations regarding documentation of services and provider qualifications.&nbsp; They agreed
  with the findings and recommendations regarding attendance, Individual Education Plans, and prototype records.</p>
