<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The objective of this audit was to determine if the Massachusetts Division
    of Medical Assistance&#8217;s (State agency) controls were adequate to ensure that the mandatory denial of payment remedy for
    substandard quality of care was applied in nursing homes that were not in substantial compliance with the prescribed
    Medicaid participation <a>requirements</a></span><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; display: none">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">.&nbsp; We
    found that 9 nursing homes billed for and received Medicaid payments for new admissions during periods when they were
    identified on State agency records as subject to the mandatory denial of payment sanction for new admissions.&nbsp; As
    a result, the State agency improperly claimed Medicaid payments totaling $64,202 ($32,101 Federal <a>share</a>).&nbsp; We
    recommend that the State agency refund the $32,101 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">and</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"> improve
    its policies and procedures to ensure that denial of payment sanctions are applied to all deficient nursing homes in
    accordance with Medicaid <a> requirements</a></span><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; display: none">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">.&nbsp; The
    State agency</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> was in substantial agreement with the report findings and has taken
    steps to implement our <a> recommendations</a>.</span></p>
