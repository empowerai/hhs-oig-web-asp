<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </P>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether inpatient 
psychiatric facilities (IPF) properly submitted Medicare claims paid by 
Riverbend Government Benefits Administrator (Riverbend) for transition <a>stays</a>.&nbsp; 
IPFs did not always properly submit claims paid by Riverbend for transition stays 
in 2005.&nbsp; Specifically, for 82 of the 100 claims that we sampled (from the 
population of 184 claims), IPFs incorrectly split the beneficiary’s stay by 
submitting 1 claim under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 
payment period and 1 or more claims under the prospective payment period, rather 
than properly submitting 1 claim for the entire inpatient stay.&nbsp; Based on our 
sample results, we estimate that Riverbend overpaid IPFs a total of $1,067,157 
for incorrectly billed Medicare claims for transition stays in <a>2005</a>.&nbsp; 
<br>
<br>
We recommended that Riverbend (1) make the appropriate 
adjustments to the sampled claims that resulted in overpayments of $579,977, (2) 
review our information on the additional 84 claims with potential overpayments 
estimated at $487,180 ($1,067,157 less $579,977) and work with the IPFs that 
provided the services to recover any overpayments, and (3) analyze postpayment 
data from IPF claims submitted after our review to ensure that the claims were 
billed properly and paid correctly by <a>Riverbend</a><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">&nbsp;</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Riverbend agreed with our findings and recommendations and 
stated that it was taking appropriate <a>action</a>.</p>
