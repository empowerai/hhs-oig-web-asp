<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that four of the six States included in our review were not verifying all eligibility information
  for individuals applying for emergency assistance (EA). Three States did not require either gathering and/or verifying
  eligibility information. In the fourth State policies and procedures for verification were acceptable, but were not followed
  for 56 percent of the cases tested. Further, some EA case folders were missing at two States in our review. As a result,
  there was no assurance that (1) all recipients were eligible for EA, and (2) EA claims and resulting expenditures were
  appropriate. We recommended that the Administration for Children and Families notify the States involved to ensure eligibility
  determinations are made in accordance with Federal regulations. </p>
