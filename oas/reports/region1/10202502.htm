<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>We statistically sampled a population of 33,791 Medicaid eligible children
  in Connecticut whose non-custodial parents (NCP) were paying child support
  and were ordered to provide medical support for their children.&nbsp; We estimate
  that the NCPs of approximately 12,500 of these children could have contributed
  toward part or all of their children’s medical costs paid by Medicaid from
  April 2001 through March 2002.&nbsp; We also estimate that about $9.3 million
  could have been collected from these NCPs, covering most of the $13.8 million
  in Medicaid costs incurred by the State and Federal Governments for medical
  services provided these children.&nbsp; Among other things, we recommended
  that Connecticut; (1) modify existing medical support orders to require NCPs
  to contribute towards the Medicaid costs for their children if health insurance
  is not otherwise available at reasonable costs, and (2) modify existing child
  support state laws to provide standard guidelines for magistrates for determining
  child and medical support orders, and adopt a standard method for determining
  the amount a NCP can pay as reimbursement of Medicaid costs. State officials
  concurred with our recommendations.</p>
