<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that 
  many hospitals serviced by Associated Hospital Services (AHS) did not establish 
  adequate internal controls to ensure that claims for anesthesia, pharmacy and 
  medical supply services used incident to other outpatient diagnostic services 
  were coded in accordance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; This was particularly 
  true of providers of cardiac catheterization services.&nbsp; In this regard, 
  hospitals, that rendered cardiac catheterizations, incorrectly coded pharmacy, 
  anesthesia and medical supplies using general revenue codes instead of the specific 
  revenue codes required when billing for services incident to other outpatient 
  diagnostic services.&nbsp; As a result, the hospitals overcharged an estimated 
  $518,000 on claims submitted to AHS.</p>
