<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the State recorded and reported CDC bioterrorism preparedness program
  funds awarded, expended, obligated, and unobligated by focus area in accordance with the cooperative agreement; ensured
  that bioterrorism preparedness program funds were used for necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs in accordance
  with the terms of the cooperative agreement; and supplanted current State or local funding with bioterrorism preparedness
  program funds.&nbsp; The State recorded and reported bioterrorism preparedness program funds by focus area in accordance
  with the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; We found no evidence of any unreasonable, unnecessary, unallocable or unallowable
  costs.&nbsp; In addition, we found no evidence of supplanting of State or local expenditures with Federal bioterrorism
  preparedness program funds.&nbsp; We noted that, as of August 30, 2004, the State had cumulative unobligated funds totaling
  $11,036,536, or 24 percent of the $45,592,117 awarded and recommended that the State monitor its bioterrorism funding to
  minimize unobligated fund balances and to ensure that program goals are met in a timely manner.</p>
