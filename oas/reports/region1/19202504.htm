<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report discloses that, contrary to Federal requirements, Connecticut's Bureau of General and Technical
  Services' Internal Service Funds had accumulated a surplus totaling $30.5 million in excessive retained earnings as of
  June 30, 1990. We noted that $17.8 million was related to our five year audit period, however, we could only verify that
  the State made an adjustment for $9.7 million against future indirect costs. Accordingly, we are recommending that the
  State make a financial adjustment for the remaining $8.1 million ($1.62 million Federal share) of the excessive retained
  earnings associated with our five year audit period. For the $12.7 million in retained earnings generated prior to our
  audit period, we are recommending that the Division of Cost Allocation negotiate a settlement of the Federal share with
  the State. </p>
