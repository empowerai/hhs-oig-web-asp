<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) allocated approximately $16.1 in unallowable costs
  to 320 facilities claiming reimbursable bad debts in Calendar Year 1996. As a result, reimbursable bad debts claimed by
  these facilities were overstated by $1.5 million. In addition to a financial adjustment for the $1.5 million, we recommended
  that FMC establish additional procedures to exclude the unallowable costs identified by our review from future cost reports.
  The FMC generally concurred with our findings and recommendations. </p>
