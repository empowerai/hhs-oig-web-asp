<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p> This report presents the results of our review of grant no. U17-CCU113278 awarded to Northeastern University (the University)
  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether costs claimed for reimbursement
  by the University represented allowable, allocable and reasonable costs under the terms of Department of Health and Human
  Services grant.&nbsp; We identified $194,890 in consultant and related indirect costs that were not adequately supported
  as required under Federal regulations and University procedures.&nbsp; In addition, we found internal control weaknesses
  relating to the monitoring of sub-recipient costs, and the submission of untimely financial status reports that were not
  reconciled to financial records.&nbsp; We recommended that the University: obtain consultant agreements for all consultants
  working on Federal grants and monitor consultant activity by requiring activity reports, PI certifications, and invoices;
  refund $194,890 to CDC for unsupported consultant costs; improve sub-recipient monitoring; and report accurate, current,
  and complete financial results that reconcile to financial records.</p>
