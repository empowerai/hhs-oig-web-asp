<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Connecticut
    Department of Social Services (the State agency) made Medicaid payments for home health care services
    provided to dual eligible beneficiaries that duplicated payments already reimbursed through a Medicare
    prospective payment system.&nbsp; For Federal fiscal years 2002 and 2003, we identified 3,453 Medicaid
    claims totaling $1.8 million ($900,000 Federal share) for home health care services that overlap
    and may have duplicated reimbursement already made under the Medicare program. &nbsp;We recommended
    that the State agency educate its provider community on proper billing practices, consider conducting
    prepayment edits of selected claims, work with the Medicare regional home health intermediary to
    develop controls for identifying and recouping Medicaid payments that should have been covered under
    Medicare, and initiate action to recover the potential overpayments identified in this audit.&nbsp; The
    State agency agreed with our recommendations for educating providers and working with CMS on recovery
    actions but disagreed that it did not have proper safeguards to ensure that Medicaid was the payer
of last resort.</p>
