<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed in accordance
  with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; Based on our review of 30 judgmentally selected outpatient hospital claims with
  outlier payments totaling $95,464, we found that for 14 of the 30 claims Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) received
  overpayments totaling $9,803 because the hospital billed the incorrect number of units for the drug intravenous immune
  globulin (IVIG).&nbsp; MGH attributes problems converting clinical units of IVIG to billable units to complexities and
  inconsistencies in the billing guidelines during the outpatient prospective payment system implementation periods.&nbsp; MGH
  performed an internal review of all outpatient claims with the drug IVIG for the period August 1, 2000 through December
  31, 2001 and identified additional overpayments of $156,023. &nbsp;We commend the hospital for its efforts to identify
  additional overpayments and strengthen controls for billing IVIG.</p>
