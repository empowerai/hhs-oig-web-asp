<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether outpatient pharmacy services at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
  (the Hospital) were billed for and reimbursed in accordance with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; Based on a statistical sample,
  we estimated that the Hospital had overstated its FY 1998 Medicare outpatient pharmacy charges by at least $221,905.&nbsp; We
  determined that the Hospital billed Medicare for medications not properly supported by medical records and for medications
  not reimbursable by Medicare.&nbsp; We noted that the Hospital did not establish or follow existing procedures for the
  proper billing and record keeping of outpatient pharmacy services.</p>
