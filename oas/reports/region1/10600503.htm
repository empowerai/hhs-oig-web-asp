<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For calendar years (CY) 2001 and 2002, Medicare Part B made 
a total of $106.9 million in potential overpayments to suppliers of outpatient 
hospital, laboratory, and radiology services on behalf of beneficiaries in Part 
A-covered skilled nursing facility stays.&nbsp; These potential overpayments occurred 
because CMS did not have Common Working File (CWF) edits in place during most of this 
period.&nbsp; For CY 2003, when the edits were fully implemented, potential 
overpayments were reduced to $22.7 million.&nbsp; We estimated that the fiscal 
intermediaries and carriers had not recovered $17.9 million of these potential 
overpayments.<br>
<br>
We recommended that CMS (1) direct the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to 
review the $106.9 million in potential overpayments for CYs 2001 and 2002 and 
make appropriate recoveries, (2) direct the fiscal intermediaries and carriers 
to initiate recovery of the estimated $17.9 million in unrecovered overpayments 
for CY 2003, (3) continue to test and refine the CWF edits 
to ensure that they properly identify claims subject to consolidated billing, 
and (4) ensure that all fiscal intermediaries and carriers have established 
proper controls to recover overpayments that the CWF edits identify.&nbsp; CMS agreed 
with the recommendations.</p>
