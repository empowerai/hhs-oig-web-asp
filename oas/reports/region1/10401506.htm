<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether costs claimed by Dartmouth College (the College) for a selected
  grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were allowable under the terms of the grant and
  applicable Federal regulations.&nbsp; The College overcharged the NIH grant by $37,780 for the principal
  investigator’s salary ($18,209 in salary and $19,571 in related fringe and indirect costs) for effort
  not related to the NIH grant.&nbsp; In addition, the College has internal control weaknesses related
  to accounting for grant application activity, implementing changes in the payroll distribution system,
  and monitoring recipients of subgrants.&nbsp; We recommended that the College refund $37,780 to NIH
  and take specific steps to strengthen its internal controls. Except for agreeing to refund $1,512 related
  to an overstated labor distribution percentage, the College generally disagreed with our recommendations.</span></p>
