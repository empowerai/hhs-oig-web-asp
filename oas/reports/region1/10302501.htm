<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This report consolidates the results of our eight-State review of the ability of noncustodial parents
  to contribute toward the Medicaid costs of Title IV-D children.&nbsp; Our objective was to estimate
  the potential savings to the Medicaid program if noncustodial parents had been required to contribute
  toward the Medicaid costs incurred for their children.&nbsp; States can reduce State and Federal Medicaid
  costs by increasing the number of noncustodial parents who provide medical support for their children.&nbsp; For
  the 1-year period we tested, 27 percent of Title IV-D children who were enrolled in Medicaid had noncustodial
  parents who were financially able to contribute toward their children’s Medicaid costs.&nbsp; These
  noncustodial parents could contribute an estimated $99 million of the Medicaid costs for the Title
  IV-D children reviewed in the eight States.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that ACF and CMS: (1) provide specific guidance to States on collecting Medicaid costs
  from noncustodial parents who have the financial ability to pay and who do not have affordable employer-sponsored
  health coverage available, (2) clarify third-party liability regulations to assist State Medicaid agencies
  in coordinating with State Title IV-D agencies to collect Medicaid costs from noncustodial parents
  with medical support orders, and (3) seek legislation that would allow States to accumulate medical
  support payments to offset Medicaid fee-for-service costs for a reasonable period.&nbsp;</p>
