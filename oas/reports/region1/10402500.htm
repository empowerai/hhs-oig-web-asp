<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether adoption assistance
    costs claimed for Federal reimbursement were adequately supported and reported in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; For
    the three Fiscal Years ended June 30, 2003, the State claimed $143,162 ($89,797 Federal share) in adoption assistance
    costs that were the result of unsupported variances, clerical errors, and incorrectly allocated costs.&nbsp; The State
    concurred with our findings and recommendations and has agreed to implement additional procedures to ensure accurate
reporting of costs claimed for Federal reimbursement.</p>
