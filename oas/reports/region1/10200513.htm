<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The report points out that Medicare paid twice for the same service--once to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) under the
  Medicare Part A prospective payment system (PPS) and again to an outside supplier under Medicare Part B. Under current
  law a skilled nursing facility (SNF) is reimbursed a prospective payment for covered services (consolidated billing) rendered
  to its Medicare beneficiaries in a Part A stay. Outside providers and suppliers must bill the SNF (not Medicare Part B)
  for most services and supplies provided. The potential improper payments to Part B providers and suppliers totaled $108.3
  million.&nbsp; Moreover, the beneficiaries of these services may have incurred unnecessary charges of $33.1 million in
  coinsurance and deductibles.&nbsp; This problem occurred because adequate controls had not been established at SNFs or
  suppliers to prevent improper billing of Medicare for Part B services included in the Part A SNF payment rate.&nbsp; Among
  other things, OIG recommended recovery of the improper payments, and that CMS instruct its contractors to encourage SNFs
  and suppliers to establish and/or enhance billing controls.</p>
