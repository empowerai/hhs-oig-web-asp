<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) under
  the administrative responsibility of Palmetto, GBA (Palmetto) billed fiscal year-end inpatient
  rehabilitation claims in accordance with Medicare requirements during the transition to the
  prospective payment system in 2002.&nbsp; Eleven IRFs did not bill fiscal year-end claims
  in accordance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Medicare made net overpayments
  of $207,289.&nbsp; Most of the payment errors occurred because the IRFs did not have adequate
  controls to ensure that claims submitted at fiscal year-end were billed in accordance with
  Medicare requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, several IRFs stated that they had split their
  claims as a result of discussions with Palmetto or in response to error messages received
  from the claims processing system.&nbsp; We were unable to validate these assertions.</p>
<p>We recommended that Palmetto make the appropriate adjustments to paid claims that resulted
  in net overpayments of $207,289 to the 11 IRFs and continue education efforts for IRF and
  Palmetto personnel.&nbsp; Palmetto agreed with our recommendations.</p>
