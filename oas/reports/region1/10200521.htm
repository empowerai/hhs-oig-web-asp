<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed in accordance
  with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; We found that a weakness in RIH’s internal controls for billing observation services
  resulted in excessive or unwarranted Medicare OPPS outlier payments to the hospital.&nbsp; We reviewed a judgmentally selected
  sample of 35 outpatient hospital claims with outlier payments totaling $93,259.&nbsp; Our sample represented less than
  2 percent of the hospital’s OPPS outlier claims and about 21 percent of the outlier payments.&nbsp; Based on our review,
  we found that overpayments totaling $13,275 were made for 21 claims because the hospital did not bill for observation services
  in accordance with Medicare regulations.&nbsp; Specifically, the hospital billed charges for observation services that
  were unsupported, not medically necessary, or excessive.&nbsp; The RIH has generally concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
