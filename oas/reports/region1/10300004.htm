<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs that Vermont claimed for school-based child health services
  were allowable and adequately supported in accordance with Federal regulations and the Medicaid State plan.&nbsp; We found
  that, of the 1,087 claims in our statistical sample, 240 were not allowable or adequately supported.&nbsp; As a result,
  we estimated that the State improperly claimed $1,463,395 in Federal funds for school-based services.&nbsp; In addition
  to recommendations to correct procedural weaknesses, we recommended that the State refund the $1,463,395 in Federal funds.&nbsp; The
  State commented that it had made some significant improvements in the program that addressed our procedural recommendations.&nbsp; Although
  the State agreed with our findings for a number of the sampled claims reviewed, it believed that the dollar impact of the
  errors included in the report were overstated.&nbsp;</p>
