<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the administrative costs that Blue Cross &amp; Blue
  Shield of Rhode Island (Rhode Island) claimed in its cost proposals complied with applicable Federal
  regulations and contract provisions.&nbsp; Rhode Island claimed costs of $2,582,664 that were not allowable
  for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; These included $1,383,533 for costs in excess of CMS-approved budget
  awards and for which adequate documentation of allowability was not provided; $1,103,268 for costs
  that exceeded the actual allowable expenses supported by company accounting records; and $95,863 for
  excess costs resulting from errors in the cost allocation process.&nbsp; These unallowable claims were
  made because Rhode Island did not have adequate internal control procedures to ensure that costs were
  claimed in accordance with Federal regulations.</p>
<p>We recommended that Rhode Island adjust
    its final administrative cost proposals by $2,582,664.&nbsp; In response to our draft report, Rhode
    Island agreed with the recommended disallowances of $1,199,131 related to costs claimed in excess
    of actual expenses and errors in the allocation process.&nbsp; However, Rhode Island did not agree
    with the remaining recommended disallowance of $1,383,533.</p>
