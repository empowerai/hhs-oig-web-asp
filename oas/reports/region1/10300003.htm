<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine (1) the
  extent of any uncollected drug rebates as of June 30, 2002, (2) whether the
  State agency had established adequate internal controls with regard to the
  Medicaid drug rebate program, and (3) the effectiveness of the actions taken
  by the State agency to resolve outstanding disputes.&nbsp; We found that controls
  were generally in place to record and track the collection of drug rebates,
  and that the federal share of drug rebate amounts was properly offset from
  federal Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp; However, we found that procedures for
  reconciling and reporting the pending drug rebate amounts and the corresponding
  aging of these rebates on the Medicaid Quarterly Expenditure Report submitted
  to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were not established.&nbsp; As
  a result, the amount reported as the pending balance at June 30, 2002 was understated
  by about $14 million (federal share). We recommended that the State agency
  ensure procedures are established to provide accurate pending rebate amounts
  and properly present an aging schedule of its drug rebate receivables in its
  quarterly reports to CMS.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our audit finding
  and recommendation and indicated the corrective actions it has taken.</p>
