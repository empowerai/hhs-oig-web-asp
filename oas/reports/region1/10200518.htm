<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether outpatient claims with outlier payments were billed in accordance
  with Medicare laws and regulations. &nbsp;We judgmentally selected 35 claims with outlier payments of $133,798.&nbsp; We
  found overpayments of $50, 280 were made for 33 of the selected claims because Mercy Hospital did not properly&nbsp;: (1)
  calculate the billable units for drugs in relation to the amount of the drug administered; and (2) identify multiple surgical
  procedures with specific HCFA Common Procedure Coding System codes.&nbsp; For these 33 claims, the reduction to the outlier
  payment received exceeded the increased reimbursement Mercy Hospital would have received had it billed properly.&nbsp; Mercy
  Hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
