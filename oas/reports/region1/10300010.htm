<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for school-based
  indirect administrative activities by the State of Rhode Island (State agency)
  were allowable under the terms of the State Medicaid plan and applicable Federal
  regulations.&nbsp; For State fiscal year 2001, we found that the State agency
  did not allocate administrative indirect costs using a Medicaid share percentage
  that accurately reflected Medicaid benefits received as required by Office
  of Management and Budget Circular A-87.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency
  overstated its Medicaid claim for reimbursement by a net amount of $123,010
  (Federal share).&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency take steps
  to improve its monitoring of contractor processing of the quarterly Medicaid
  claims; request that each local education agency review contractor quarterly
  claim calculations before attesting to the accuracy of the claims; refund the
  overpayment; and recalculate Medicaid share percentages for all of the local
  education agencies for the audit period as well as subsequent periods and submit
  adjusted claims to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as necessary.&nbsp; The
  State agency generally agreed to the procedural recommendations but disagreed
  to make a financial adjustment.</p>
