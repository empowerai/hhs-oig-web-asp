<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether fiscal year 1999 Medicare outlier payments to Bridgeport Hospital
  were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; Our review determined that Bridgeport Hospital
  received $23,409 in overpayments relating to services that were not ordered by a physician, were not properly documented,
  represented duplicate billing, resulted from submission of incorrect DRG codes and involved charges not related to an inpatient
  stay.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment and procedural improvements.&nbsp; Bridgeport Hospital < concurred with
  our findings and identified corrective actions they have taken.</p>
