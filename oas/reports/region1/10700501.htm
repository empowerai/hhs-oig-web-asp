<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </P>
<P>Our objective was to determine whether Connecticut VNA, Inc., (the agency) 
complied with Medicare requirements in billing for fiscal year 2004 and 2005 
services for beneficiaries who had been discharged from an acute care hospital 
in the preceding 14 days. &nbsp;The agency improperly coded 35 claims as if the 
beneficiaries had not been discharged from an acute care hospital within the 
14-day period preceding the home health admission.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services’s prepayment edit corrected 27 of the 35 claims.&nbsp; Overpayments 
for the eight claims not identified by the edit totaled $3,683.&nbsp; We 
recommended that the agency (1) ensure that its adjustments to reimburse 
Medicare for the $3,683 were processed by the regional home health intermediary 
and (2) further educate its staff regarding the importance of identifying all 
facilities that had discharged the beneficiary within 14 days of the home health 
episode and determining which of these facilities were acute care (including 
long-term care) hospitals.</P></BODY></HTML>
