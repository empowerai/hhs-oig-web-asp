<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Massachusetts Division 
  of Medical Assistance (DMA) used Medicaid funds to pay for prescription drugs 
  and other (non-inpatient/long term care) health care services provided to inmates.&nbsp; 
  We reviewed a random sample of Medicaid Claims from a database of claims paid 
  on behalf of individuals who had been identified as incarcerated at some time 
  during our audit period.&nbsp; We found that with few exceptions, the services 
  were not provided during the periods of incarceration.&nbsp; Accordingly, we 
  concluded that DMA procedures reasonably preclude Medicaid payments for services 
  for individuals who are incarcerated.</p>
