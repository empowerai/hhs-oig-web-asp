<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Included in the Medicare diagnosis related group (DRG) payments hospitals receive are nonphysician outpatient
  services, such as laboratory, radiology, and other diagnostic tests, provided (1) up to 3 days prior to the date of admission
  and (2) by the hospital or a related provider.&nbsp; The intent of the 3-day payment window provision is to prevent hospitals
  from claiming separate payments for preadmission services that should already be included in the inpatient DRG payment.&nbsp; This
  final report points out, however, that providers often render such services 4 or more days prior to the inpatient admission.&nbsp; Based
  on a statistical sample, we estimate, for 10 specific DRGs, that during calendar year 2000 Medicare reimbursed providers
  approximately $37 million for preadmission services rendered 4 to 14 days prior to the date of a related inpatient admission.&nbsp; Additionally,
  the beneficiaries were assessed $35 million for coinsurance and deductibles for these services.&nbsp; We recommended that
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) consider proposing legislation to expand the DRG payment window.&nbsp; The
  CMS concurred with our recommendation, but raised a concern as to whether such an action&nbsp; could influence medical
  practice and increase the health risks for beneficiaries.&nbsp; We agree that CMS should take such factors into consideration
  before proposing a legislative change expanding the payment window.</p>
