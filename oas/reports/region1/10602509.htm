<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</P></STRONG> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Our objective was to determine 
whether the Rhode Island Department Children, Youth, and Families (the State 
agency) properly claimed Federal reimbursement at the enhanced rate for Title 
IV-E training costs from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2005.&nbsp; The State agency 
properly claimed training costs totaling $3.2 million ($2.4 million Federal 
share) for Federal reimbursement at the enhanced 75-percent rate under Title 
IV-E.&nbsp; However, the State agency overstated the Federal share of foster care and 
adoption assistance training costs by $238,441 by claiming training expenses at 
the enhanced rate that were only allowable at the 50-percent rate.&nbsp; We 
recommended that the State agency make a financial adjustment of $238,441 on its 
next Quarterly Report of Expenditures, establish procedures to ensure that only 
qualified training expenses are claimed at the enhanced rate, and review 
training costs claimed for Federal reimbursement after the audit period to 
ensure compliance with Federal requirements. The State agency agreed with our 
recommendations.</p>
