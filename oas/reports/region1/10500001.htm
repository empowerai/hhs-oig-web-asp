<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency claimed Medicaid 
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for fiscal year 2004 that did not 
comply with the hospital-specific DSH limits imposed by Federal requirements and 
the State plan.&nbsp; Of the $194,145,507 that the State agency claimed, $123,494,571 
was allowable.&nbsp; However, the remaining $70,650,936 ($35,325,468 Federal share) 
was unallowable.&nbsp; We attribute the excess DSH payments to the State agency’s 
lack of policies and procedures to ensure that its methodology for developing 
the cost-to-charge ratios used to calculate hospital-specific DSH limits 
complied with Federal requirements and the State plan.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) refund 
$35,325,468 to the Federal Government, (2) work with CMS to review DSH payments 
claimed after our audit period and refund any overpayments, and (3) establish 
policies and procedures to ensure that it complies with Federal requirements and 
the State plan in calculating future hospital-specific DSH limits. &nbsp;The State 
agency disagreed with these recommendations.</p>
