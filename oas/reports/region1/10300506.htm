<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></P>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed the Manchester Memorial Hospital&nbsp; (Hospital)
  for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; We found that the Hospital relies upon physicians working nearby
  in the Hospital and in its emergency department for physician supervision coverage of its outpatient cardiac rehabilitation
  program.&nbsp; However, medical record documentation we examined showed little evidence that a physician personally sees
  a patient periodically throughout the program.&nbsp; In addition, we reviewed a sample of 10 Medicare beneficiaries who
  received outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services during calendar year 2001.&nbsp; We found that medical and billing
  records provided by the Hospital in support of two beneficiaries receiving cardiac rehabilitation services totaling $318
  did not always support the diagnoses used to establish the patients&#8217; eligibility for cardiac rehabilitation.&nbsp; Further,
  we found that the Hospital did not always follow the Medicare fiscal intermediary&#8217;s (FI) coding guidelines for submission
  of a Medicare claim for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital work with the
  FI to ensure that the Hospital&#8217;s outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program is being conducted in accordance with Medicare
coverage and billing requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital generally agreed with our recommendations.</p>
