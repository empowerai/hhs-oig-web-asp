<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report provides a summary of systems used by some States to identify, investigate, and resolve incidents of abuse
  or neglect of persons with disabilities. Up to 90 percent of persons with disabilities reside in facilities, such as group
  homes, residential schools, and supervised apartments, that do not receive Medicare or Medicaid funding. With little or
  no Federal assistance involved, these people must rely solely on State systems to identify, investigate, and resolve reports
  of abuse or neglect. Such laws, regulations, and systems for protecting persons with disabilities from abuse or neglect
  can vary significantly from State to State. We are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration, the Administration
  for Children and Families, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration work
  cooperatively to provide information and technical assistance to the States to (1) improve the reporting of potential abuse
  or neglect of persons with disabilities; (2) strengthen investigative and resolution processes; (3) facilitate the analysis
  of incident data to identify trends indicative of systemic problems; and (4) identify the nature and cause of incidents
  to prevent future abuse. </p>
