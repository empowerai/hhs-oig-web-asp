<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Duke University Medical Center (the Hospital) overstated 
its wage data by $9,283,606 and 50,857 hours in its fiscal year (FY) 2006 
Medicare cost report.&nbsp; Correcting the Hospital’s errors decreased the average 
hourly wage rate from $31.51 to $30.96.&nbsp; Under the acute-care hospital inpatient 
prospective payment system, CMS adjusts the Medicare base rate paid to 
participating hospitals by the wage index applicable to the area in which the 
hospitals are located. &nbsp;CMS updates the wage indexes annually based on 
hospitals’ reported wage data.<span style="font-size:11.5pt">&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
We recommended that the Hospital submit a revised FY 2006 Medicare cost 
report to the fiscal intermediary to correct the wage data overstatements and 
implement review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage data 
reported in future Medicare cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in 
compliance with Medicare requirements.<br>
<br>
The Hospital agreed with most of our findings but disagreed, in part, that it 
had included in its wage data unsupported costs for Part B services provided by 
nurse practitioners. &nbsp;Because the Hospital provided additional information on 
these costs, we revised this finding.</p>
