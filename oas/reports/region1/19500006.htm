<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report presents the results of our review of the Connecticut Department of Social Services' (State Agency's) reimbursements
  for clinical laboratory services under the Medicaid program. The objective of our review was to determine the adequacy
  of procedures and controls over the processing of Medicaid payments to providers for clinical laboratory services. Our
  review was limited to clinical laboratory services involving chemistry, hematology and urinalysis tests. </p>
<p>Our review disclosed that the State agency informed Medicaid providers of the requirements for claiming reimbursement
  of clinical laboratory tests and reviewed reimbursement of Medicaid services, including clinical laboratory tests, made
  to selected providers on a post payment basis. However, the State agency did not have adequate edits in its claims processing
  system to ensure that all reimbursement for clinical laboratory tests under Medicaid did not exceed amounts recognized
  by the Medicare program, as required by Section 6300 of the State Medicaid Manual. In this regard, Medicare regulations
  provide that claims for laboratory services in which a provider bills separately for tests that are available as part of
  an automated multichannel chemistry panel, should be paid at the lesser amount for the panel. Specifically, we found that
  providers received excess reimbursements for automated multichannel chemistry tests that should have been grouped (bundled
  into a panel) for payment at a lower rate. In addition, the State agency's claim payment system did not have adequate edits
  to detect and prevent payment of duplicate or multiple units of the same hematology or urinalysis tests. </p>
<p>We statistically selected 150 instances involving claims with potential payment errors from a population of calendar years
  1993 and 1994 paid claims valued at $2,237,391. We found that 124 of the 150 sampled instances were potentially overpaid.
  Each of the 124 instances represents a payment error in which the State agency paid a provider for clinical laboratory
  tests on behalf of the same recipient on the same date of service. The payment errors consisted of individual tests that
  were billed separately instead of as part of a lower cost group and tests that were duplicative of each other. The State
  agency had already identified and recovered overpayments related to 29 of the 124 instances of potential error. As a result,
  we projected only the remaining 95 errors from our statistical sample over the sample population using standard statistical
  methods. We estimate that the State agency overpaid providers $427,068 (Federal share $213,534) for chemistry, hematology
  and urinalysis tests. </p>
<p>We are recommending that the State agency (1) install necessary controls and edits to detect and prevent payment for unbundled
  and/or duplicative laboratory services; (2) take appropriate action to recover overpayments caused by unbundled or duplicative
  clinical laboratory services that have not been previously identified; and (3) make adjustments for the Federal share of
  the amounts recovered by the State agency on its Quarterly Report of Expenditures to the Health Care Financing Administration.
  In response to our draft report, the State agency agreed with our recommendations. </p>
