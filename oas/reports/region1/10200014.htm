<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for
  school-based health services by Rhode Island were allowable under the terms of the State Medicaid plan and applicable Federal
  or State requirements.&nbsp; We reviewed a statistically valid sample of 200 medical services from the State's two largest
  local education agencies (Providence and Pawtucket), which represented $82 million or about one-third of the State agency's
  claim for school-based health services.&nbsp; We concluded that 83 medical services (containing 99 payment errors) did
  not meet Medicaid reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate that at least $1.2 million (Federal share)
  was unallowable for reimbursement.&nbsp; Proper internal controls were not always established or sufficient because the
  local education agencies were not always made aware of all Medicaid billing requirements.&nbsp; Further, we found the State
  agency did not always provide sufficient oversight and monitoring of school-based services to ensure local compliance with
  Federal and State regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment for $1.2 million, and procedural
  improvements to correct noted weaknesses.</p>
