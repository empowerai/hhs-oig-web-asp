<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>A prior audit showed that Medicare carriers overpaid independent clinical and physician laboratories about $50.2 million
  for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests during the 2-year period ended June 30, 1995. Our follow-up audit showed
  that while significant improvements have occurred (overpayments decreased to about $31.2 million for such tests for the
  2 ½-year period ended December 31, 1997), certain carriers still did not have adequate procedures and controls (including
  edits) to detect and prevent inappropriate payment for laboratory tests. In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended
  that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) ensure carriers implement controls adequate to preclude such overpayments.
  The HCFA concurred with our recommendations. </p>
