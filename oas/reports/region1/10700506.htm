<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</STRONG> </P>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Our objective was to 
determine whether </span>Caritas St. Elizabeth's Medical Center (the Hospital)<span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> 
billed Medicare in accordance with Medicare requirements for laboratory tests 
provided to </span>end stage renal disease (ESRD)<span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> 
beneficiaries during </span>calendar years<span style="layout-grid-mode:
line"> (CY) 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; We found that <a name="OLE_LINK1">t</a></span>he Hospital 
did not always bill Medicare in accordance with Medicare requirements for 
laboratory tests provided to ESRD beneficiaries.&nbsp; Specifically, the Hospital 
incorrectly billed for (1) hematology laboratory services included in the 
composite rate, (2) automated multi-channel chemistry tests that did not meet 
specific reimbursement requirements, and (3) ferritin tests performed beyond the 
allowable frequency without medical justification.&nbsp; Based on the results of a 
statistical sample, we estimated that Medicare overpaid the Hospital $61,628 for 
laboratory services provided to ESRD beneficiaries during CYs 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the Hospital refund the Medicare 
Program $61,628 in overpayments for CYs 2004 and 2005, identify and refund any 
Medicare payments for ESRD-related laboratory services received after our audit 
period that did not meet Medicare requirements and strengthen its policies and 
procedures to ensure compliance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; The Hospital 
agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p></BODY></HTML>
