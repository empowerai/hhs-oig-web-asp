<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the fiscal intermediary (FI) established effective
  controls over the accounting and reporting of administrative costs, and the costs claimed on the proposal complied with
  applicable Federal regulations and contract provisions.&nbsp; As a result, the FI did not employ control procedures sufficient
  to ensure compliance with Federal cost principles and Medicare contract provisions.&nbsp; During fiscal years (FY) 1999
  through 2001, the FI claimed $67.6 million in Medicare administrative costs.&nbsp; We found that the FI claimed unallowable
  costs totaling $2,754,992.&nbsp; Internal control weaknesses also resulted in $634,724 in data processing costs being set
  aside for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services review and $1.4 million of pension cost reporting errors being
  included in the FY 2001 proposal.&nbsp; The above findings primarily related to inadequate controls for supporting and
  allocating indirect costs to the Medicare program.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and improvements to internal
  controls.</p>
