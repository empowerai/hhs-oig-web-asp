<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report provides information prepared by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and
  Human Services (HHS) summarizing our audit activity in the college and university area for Calendar Year (CY) 1992. During
  CY 1992, the Federal Government allocated an estimated $10.5 billion to research universities. The HHS contributed $5.5
  billion, or 52 percent, of the Federal total. During this same time period, the OIG and nonfederal auditors performed 679
  audits in the college and university area. This resulted in Governmentwide findings totaling over $361.5 million. The primary
  focus of our audit work was our continuing effort to ensure that only allowable and properly allocable costs are charged
  to research and to continue to explore meaningful and effective reforms in cost reimbursement methods. </p>
