<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The State agency did not claim Medicaid
<span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal">nonemergency 
transportation (NET)</span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-weight: normal">
</span></span>costs in accordance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; 
Specifically, the State agency’s purchase of monthly bus passes was not cost 
effective based on beneficiaries’ use of medical services.&nbsp; From March 2004 
through May 2005, bus pass recipients averaged 1.5 medical services per month 
for months in which they received a pass.&nbsp; The less costly purchase of 10-ride 
bus passes could have saved at least $9.8 million ($4.9&nbsp;million Federal share) 
during our 15-month audit period.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency’s claim 
included the costs of approximately 8,700 bus passes for beneficiaries of two 
non-Medicaid State programs.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency overstated its claim 
for NET costs by $386,452 ($193,226 Federal share).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) either refund $4.9 
million (Federal share) for NET costs claimed for monthly bus passes or provide 
documentation to show that the passes were the most cost-effective means of 
providing NET; (2) refund $193,226 (Federal share) in unallowable NET costs 
claimed for beneficiaries of two non-Medicaid State programs; (3) in the absence 
of documentation demonstrating that monthly bus passes were the most 
cost-effective means of providing NET to Medicaid beneficiaries, review NET 
costs for bus passes reimbursed after our audit period and refund the excess NET 
costs to the Federal Government; and (4) establish policies and procedures to 
ensure that it complies with Federal requirements and the State plan for 
claiming NET costs.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with our second recommendation but 
disagreed with the other recommendations.&nbsp; Nothing in the State's response 
has caused us to alter our recommendations.</p>
