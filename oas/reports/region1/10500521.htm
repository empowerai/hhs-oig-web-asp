<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine
    whether inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) under the administrative responsibility
    of United Government Services, LLC (UGS) billed fiscal year-end inpatient rehabilitation
    claims in accordance with Medicare requirements during the transition to the prospective
    payment system in 2002.&nbsp; Thirty-four IRFs did not bill 340 fiscal year-end claims
    in accordance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; As a result, Medicare made net overpayments
    of $516,303.&nbsp; Some IRFs did not have adequate controls to ensure that claims submitted
    at fiscal year-end were billed accordance with Medicare requirements, and two IRFs stated
    that they had received inaccurate information from UGS.</p>
<p>We recommended that UGS make
    the appropriate adjustments to paid claims that resulted in net overpayments of $516,303
    to the 34 IRFs and continue education efforts for IRF and UGS personnel.&nbsp; UGS agreed
    with our recommendations.</p>
