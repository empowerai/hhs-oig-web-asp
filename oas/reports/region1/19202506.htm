<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Administration for Children and Families's (ACF) policies
  and procedures as promulgated through regulations set forth in Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) uniform procedures
  for each phase of the overpayment recovery process. We found that ACF's policies and procedures are too general and do
  not provide State and local agencies with specific uniform procedures to use for each phase of the overpayment recovery
  process. According to its own quality control data, the ACF estimates that in 1990 State and local agencies made over $1
  billion in Aid to Families with Dependent Children program overpayments. </p>
