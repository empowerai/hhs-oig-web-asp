<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Massachusetts Office of Medicaid (the State agency)
  claimed allowable Medicaid targeted case management (TCM) services rendered by Department
  of Social Services (Social Services) during Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2002 and 2003.&nbsp; The
  State agency claimed unallowable Medicaid TCM services rendered by Social Services.&nbsp; The
  Social Services TCM monthly rates charged to Medicaid included social workers’ salary costs
  related to direct social services, such as child protection and welfare services.&nbsp; Eliminating
  these unallowable costs from the calculation of the monthly rates, we determined that the
  costs of TCM services claimed through the State agency were overstated by $171,147,058 ($86,645,347
  Federal share).&nbsp; We were unable to express an opinion on the remaining $26,571,177 ($13,460,989
  Federal share) that related to the assessment of beneficiaries’ service needs, development
  of a specific care plan, referral to needed services, and monitoring and followup.&nbsp; Although
  these services may appear to constitute allowable TCM services under existing policy, our
  audit work identified a significant risk that the services may have already been reimbursed
  under other Federal programs.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency: (1) refund to the Federal Government $86,645,347 in
  unallowable costs; (2) work with CMS to determine the allowability of the $26,571,177 ($13,460,989
  Federal share) on which we were unable to express an opinion; (3) refund to the Federal Government
  any TCM costs claimed and reimbursed subsequent to our audit period that represent direct
  medical, educational, or social services; and (4) establish procedures to ensure that TCM
  rates used to claim Medicaid reimbursement do not include payment for direct medical, educational,
  or social services to which the Medicaid-eligible individual has been referred.&nbsp; In
  its comments on our draft report, the State agency disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
