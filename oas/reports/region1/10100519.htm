<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to identify potential Part B credit balances and substantiate their existence through
  confirmation with the Medicare carriers and the beneficiaries’ primary insurers.&nbsp; Based on our review and confirmation
  with insurance companies, we found that payments made by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island (BSBSRI) for services
  for 3 of the 10 sample beneficiary cases included 60 mistaken Part B payments valued at $5,995 that have not been recovered
  by Medicare.&nbsp; Of the $5,995 in mistaken payments, $2,357 represented payments for services paid by both Medicare and
  the primary insurer.&nbsp; The remaining $3,638 represents improper payments for services that should have been billed
  to the primary insurer.&nbsp; We provided BCBSRI with the claims detail information to facilitate its collection efforts
  with respect to these credit balances.&nbsp; The BCBSRI has taken overpayment action on the 60 mistaken payments processed
  by their office.</p>
