<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for school-based
  health services by the Massachusetts Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) were
  reasonable, allowable, and adequately supported in accordance with the terms of
  the State Medicaid plan and applicable Federal regulations.&nbsp; Based on our
  review of claims data at the eight selected local education agencies (LEA), we
  estimated that at least $2,997,268 (Federal share) was ineligible for reimbursement.&nbsp; In
  this regard, we found that:&nbsp; (1) sufficient documentation was not always maintained
  to ensure that services prescribed in the students' individualized education plans
  (IEP) were delivered; (2) school-based health services were rendered by health
  care providers that did not have the qualifications required by DMA; (3) claims
  were submitted for students who were absent; (4) IEPs were not available to cover
  periods in which the Medicaid program was billed; and (5) the school-based service
  type was sometimes billed incorrectly.</p>
<p>We recommended that DMA:&nbsp; (1) provide training and technical assistance to
  LEAs, (2) review all guidance issued to LEAs relative to the school-based health
  program for clarity and completeness and reissue, as needed, (3) design a monitoring/audit
  system to ensure that LEAs comply with Medicaid requirements, (4) develop a new
  fee-for-service methodology for school-based health services that complies with
  Federal documentation requirements, (5) discontinue providing listings of Medicaid
  eligible students to LEAs, (6) establish procedures consistent with Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements regarding electronic transmission
  of data which contain uniquely identifying information, and (7) refund to CMS the
  $2,997,268 (Federal share) that was inappropriately paid by the Medicaid program
  to the eight LEAs.</p>
