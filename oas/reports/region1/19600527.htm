<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that Medicare fiscal intermediaries (FI) did not always have adequate controls to detect
  and prevent inappropriate payment for certain laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests). We estimated
  nationwide FI overpayments to hospital outpatient department laboratories of $43.6 million during the 2-year period ended
  December 31, 1995. For the same period, an additional $15.6 million could have been saved if policies had been developed
  to preclude payment for medically unnecessary automated hematology indices. In addition to recovering overpayments, we
  recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) direct FIs to implement additional procedures and controls
  to ensure proper payments in the future. We also recommended that HCFA consider eliminating separate reimbursement for
  additional hematology indices. The HCFA officials generally concurred with our recommendations, and agreed to take corrective
  action. </p>
