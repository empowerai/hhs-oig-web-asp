<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether inpatient rehabilitation facilities
  (IRFs) billed claims in compliance with Medicare prospective payment system regulations for
  interrupted stays.&nbsp; Through a nationwide computer match designed to identify interrupted
  stays billed as multiple claims, we found that IRFs did not always bill claims in compliance
  with Medicare prospective payment system regulations for interrupted stays.&nbsp; Specifically,
  during calendar years 2002 and 2003, Medicare made net overpayments of $5.9 million to 589
  IRFs for interrupted stays billed as 2 or more claims.&nbsp; We recommended that the Centers
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS):&nbsp; (1) direct its fiscal intermediaries to
  recover the $5.9 million in net overpayments identified in our review, (2) use the results
  of this review to clarify guidance to IRFs regarding the correct billing of interrupted stays,
  (3) strengthen the edit in its Common Working File to detect all interrupted stays incorrectly
  billed as two or more claims and prevent associated payments, and (4) instruct its fiscal
  intermediaries to conduct matches similar to the one that we conducted to identify additional
  payment errors for claims after December 31, 2003.&nbsp; CMS agreed with our recommendations
  to recover the overpayments and clarify guidance to the IRFs.&nbsp; Additionally, CMS stated
  that it had implemented the recommended edit in its Common Working File as of April 1, 2005.&nbsp; CMS
  did not agree with our recommendation to instruct its fiscal intermediaries to conduct matches
  similar to the one that we conducted for payment errors that occurred before the edit was
  implemented.</p>
