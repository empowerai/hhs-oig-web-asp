<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that, for Calendar Year 1998, psychiatric hospitals in the 10 locations reviewed were
  paid a statistically estimated $57 million for unallowable or unsupported outpatient psychiatric services. The payments
  were unallowable because the services were not documented in accordance with Medicare requirements and/or were not reasonable
  and necessary. We recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) require Medicare fiscal intermediaries
  to initiate recovery of payments for claims found in error and increase post-payment reviews of outpatient psychiatric
  service claims. We also recommended that HCFA further emphasize its documentation requirements for all types of outpatient
  psychiatric services through seminars, educational sessions, and newsletters. The HCFA concurred with our recommendations. </p>
