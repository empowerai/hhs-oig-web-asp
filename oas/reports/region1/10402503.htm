<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (the agency)
  complied with Federal eligibility requirement in claiming adoption assistance payments for Federal
  reimbursement.&nbsp; While the agency met the Federal adoption assistance eligibility requirements
  for 966 of 1369 children in State fiscal year (SFY) 2001, the agency inappropriately claimed adoption
  assistance maintenance payments for the remaining 403 children.&nbsp; The agency continued to claim
  adoption assistance payments for 310 of the 403 ineligible children in SFY 2002 and 261 in SFY 2003.&nbsp; As
  a result, the agency over claimed $4.2 million (Federal share).&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the agency: (1) make a financial adjustment of $2.5 million on its next Federal
  Quarterly Report of Expenditures; (2) work with ACF to resolve the $1.7 million in over claimed payments
  for children not meeting judicial determination requirements; (3) claim adoption assistance payments
  only for children that meet Federal eligibility requirements; (4) ensure that eligibility specialists
  completely and accurately enter all manual transactions in the State IV-E computer system; (5) claim
  adoption assistance payments only for children for whom judicial determinations were made within the
  required time period; (6) maintain eligibility information in the adoption assistance case files as
  required; and (7) identify any new adoption assistance cases in SFYs 2002 or 2003 that were claimed
  in error and make the appropriate financial adjustment.&nbsp; The agency concurred with our findings
  and recommendations.</p>
