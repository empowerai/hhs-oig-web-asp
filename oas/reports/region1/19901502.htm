<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation (MPTN) extended eligibility for federally discounted
  drugs to its nonIndian employees without making the required determination that reasonable alternative drug services were
  not available to these employees. Many alternative sources were available. As a result, in Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999 MPTN
  provided $5.8 million worth of discounted drugs to individuals not eligible to receive them. Also, MPTN did not follow
  Federal guidelines requiring entities to identify their 340B drug purchases, and its contract relationships with 16 other
  tribes do not met 340B guidelines. Recommendations call for actions the Indian Health Service and the Health Resources
  and Services Administration need to take to help improve MPTN's administration of its 340B drug purchase program. </p>
