<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine the reasonableness of about $1.2 
  million in inpatient and outpatient Medicare bad debts claimed by the Baystate 
  Medical Center (Hospital) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999.&nbsp; 
  We reviewed a sample of 138 Medicare bad debt claims totaling $151,858 and identified 
  $54,986 which did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements. Specifically, 
  the Hospital claimed bad debts that lacked sufficient collection efforts, were 
  for non-covered services, or were not adequately documented. We also found that 
  the Hospital understated its bad debt recoveries and should have offset its 
  Medicare bad debt claim by an additional $96,801. In total, the Hospital overstated 
  its bad debt reimbursement by $151,787. We recommended that the Hospital strengthen 
  it procedures to ensure that its claims for reimbursement of Medicare bad debts 
  are properly reported in accordance with Medicare regulations and that the fiscal 
  intermediary apply the net reduction of $151,787 to the Hospital's FY 1999 Medicare 
  cost report. The Hospital generally agreed with our recommendations and instituted 
  new policies to strengthen its policies and procedures for identifying and writing 
  off bad debts. </p>
