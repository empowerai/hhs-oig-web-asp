<P><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </P>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Our objective 
was to determine whether the credit balances recorded in Baystate Medical 
Center’s (the Hospital) accounting records for inpatient and outpatient services 
for Medicaid beneficiaries represented overpayments more than 60 days old that 
the Hospital should have returned to the Medicaid program.&nbsp; We identified 267 
overpayments more than 60 days old that the Hospital should have returned to the 
Medicaid program.&nbsp; As a result, the Hospital did not promptly return Medicaid 
overpayments totaling $184,835 ($92,418 Federal share) to the Medicaid program 
in accordance with State Medicaid requirements.&nbsp; We recommended that the 
Hospital return these overpayments to the Massachusetts Medicaid program and 
continue efforts to identify and return all overpayments to Medicaid in 
accordance with State requirements.&nbsp; The 
Hospital agreed substantially with our observations and findings.</span></p>
