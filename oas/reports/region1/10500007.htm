<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>:</p>






<p class="MsoBodyText">Our objective was to determine whether the State agency 
had effective controls to ensure that claims processed and adjudicated through 
the Maine Claims Management System (MECMS) from January 21, 2005, through 
December 31, 2005, were in compliance with Medicaid requirements.&nbsp; We found the 
State agency did not establish effective controls to ensure that Medicaid claims 
were processed correctly and paid appropriately, and that all claim-related 
expenditures were reported accurately for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We 
recommended the State agency reprocess all claims processed through MECMS after 
the  CMS certifies the system; continue to 
reconcile interim payments; maintain supporting documentation; continue to ensure all MECMS 
claims processing and reporting controls are implemented; ensure that MECMS 
reporting controls adequately identify 
overpayments related to third party liability and over-utilization of services; 
ensure that all overpayments are reported within 60 days of discovery; and 
submit quarterly data from its Medicaid Statistical Information System to CMS 
after reprocessing the claims.&nbsp; The State agency generally concurred with our 
recommendations except for the recommendation to reprocess all claims after CMS 
certifies the system.</span></p>
