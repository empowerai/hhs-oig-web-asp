<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to identify potentially excessive Medicare payments made to institutional providers for
  outpatient services during Calendar Year (CY) 2000.&nbsp; We initially brought the issue of excessive payments to the attention
  of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in our report entitled <i>Review of Potentially Excessive Medicare
  Payments for Outpatient Services (A-01-00-00502)</i>, dated May 16, 2001.&nbsp; Our current review is a follow up on the
  prior issues we identified.&nbsp; The UGS is one of four fiscal intermediaries we have selected for the follow up review.&nbsp; Based
  on a computer application, we identified 13 outpatient claims reimbursed by UGS where the number of units or services billed
  appeared to be excessive.&nbsp; Our analysis showed that provider-billing errors on six renal dialysis facility claims
  resulted in incorrect payments amounting to $386,577.&nbsp; We also identified seven outpatient hospital claims submitted
  by one provider where the pharmacy charges totaled over $1.3 million. </p>
