<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Under current Medicare regulations, separate payment for nonphysician outpatient services rendered within the diagnosis-related
  group (DRG) payment window are not allowed. Our audit report identifies, however, over $27 million in potential improper
  billings and subsequent payments for nonphysician outpatient services rendered within the DRG payment window for the period
  January 1992 through December 1994. This is a continuing problem. As a result of prior reviews on this subject the Health
  Care Financing Administration has recovered over $100 million in improper payments. Our office has initiated a joint project
  with the Department of Justice to recover overpayments and to assess penalties and interest. The Health Care Financing
  Administration has also agreed with our procedural recommendations designed to address this problem. </p>
