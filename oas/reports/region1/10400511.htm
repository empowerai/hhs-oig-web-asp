<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Windham Hospital (the hospital) reported fiscal
  year (FY) 2000 Medicare cost report wage data in compliance with Medicare laws, regulations, and guidance.&nbsp; We
  found that the hospital did not fully comply with Medicare laws, regulations, and guidance for the
  reporting of wage data and overstated wage data reported by $404,402 for the Medicare FY 2000 cost
  report period.&nbsp; Due to the impact of overstated wages, the FY 2004 (1) Connecticut statewide rural
  wage index is overstated by about 1 percent, and (2) average payment to the 2 hospitals in the Connecticut
  statewide rural area and 17 additional hospitals in 2 Connecticut urban metropolitan statistical areas
  is overstated by about $24 per hospital discharge.&nbsp; We recommended that the hospital strengthen
  financial reporting controls.&nbsp; The hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations, except
  our finding that wage data was overstated due to the inclusion of unfunded postretirement benefit costs.&nbsp; We
  removed this finding from our final report and addressed the issue in the Other Matters section of
  the report.</p>
