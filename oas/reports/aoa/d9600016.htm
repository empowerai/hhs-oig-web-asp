<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Ombudsmen play an important role in helping to ensure that the elderly are 
  properly cared for and protected from abuse in long term care facilities. In 
  Maryland's Montgomery County, however, we found that the review and reporting 
  network did not provide reasonable assurance that instances of abuse occurring 
  in long term care facilities were properly reported and resolved. Similar deficiencies 
  were found in other counties but to a lesser degree. We also found that the 
  State Ombudsman had not conducted annual monitoring reviews of local Ombudsman 
  programs. Finally, we found that the Geriatric Nurse Aide (GNA) Registry, which 
  is supposed to record the history of nurse aide abuses, did not always record 
  such information on individuals who were found to have abused residents of nursing 
  homes. Among other things, we recommended that Maryland's Office on Aging (OoA) 
  take action to: (1) improve the GNA Registry to include information on findings 
  of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property by a GNA, (2) improve procedures 
  used to receive, investigate and resolve complaints timely, and (3) make the 
  required annual monitoring visits of local Ombudsman programs. The OoA agreed 
  with our recommendations and stated they will work diligently to implement them.
