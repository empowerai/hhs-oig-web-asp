<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Our audit of 8 Maryland nursing homes disclosed 51 employees that, according 
  to FBI records, had been convicted for a variety of crimes. The employees included 
  certified nurse aides as well as staff holding jobs not subject to background 
  checks. Also, our background check of 35 individuals who had been convicted 
  of elder abuse in Maryland showed 7 had prior convictions for other types of 
  crimes, including those against people. An audit of Illinois nursing homes demonstrated 
  similar results. These audits plus surveys in other States clearly indicate 
  that, among other things, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and 
  the Administration on Aging (AoA) should work with the States to improve the 
  safety of long term care residents and to strengthen safeguards against the 
  employment of abusive workers by elder care facilities. The HCFA should also 
  consider establishing Federal requirements and criteria for performing criminal 
  background checks. The HCFA and AoA generally agreed with our findings and recommendations.
