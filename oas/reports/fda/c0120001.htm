<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of 
  the accuracy of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) official establishment 
  inventory (OEI)--a computerized data base of establishments under the regulatory 
  purview of FDA.&nbsp; The FDA is required to inspect, at least once every 2 
  years, establishments registered with FDA that are engaged in the manufacturer, 
  preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of drugs and devices.&nbsp; 
  The FDA inspections identify objectionable conditions and practices and may 
  form the basis for administrative or regulatory action against the establishments 
  such as warning letters, license, suspension, product seizure, injunction, or 
  prosecution.&nbsp; The FDA's OEI, which listed 135,885 establishments at the 
  time of our review, is not accurate and could be reduced by 21,742 establishments, 
  or 16 percent.&nbsp; This error rate is higher than the goal FDA set for itself, 
  which is accuracy within 5 percent.&nbsp; These inaccuracies were due to FDA 
  district offices suspending their quality assurance reviews of their respective 
  portions of the OEI during the transition to an updated management information 
  system.&nbsp; The FDA agreed with our recommendations for corrective action 
  and provided&nbsp; a plan for implementation.</p>
