<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Baltimore City Health 
  Department (BCHD) implemented Ryan White activities and spent its administrative 
  funding in a manner consistent with the CARE Act and other federal guidelines.&nbsp; 
  Overall, BCHD had implemented a comprehensive service delivery program for HIV/AIDS 
  patients living in the Baltimore Eligible Metropolitan Area; however, its administrative 
  activities and processes have not been entirely effective to ensure that program 
  results are achieved and federal funds awarded to contractors are used appropriately.&nbsp; 
  We made recommendations for improvement in the areas of cash management, program 
  monitoring, and fiscal monitoring.&nbsp; The BCHD concurred with our findings 
  and recommendations.</p>
