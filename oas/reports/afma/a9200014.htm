<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report presents the results of our audit of the personnel and payroll 
  functions of the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) in the Department of Health and Human 
  Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Personnel Administration (ASPER). 
  Nothing came to our attention in the course of our audit to indicate that ASPER 
  was not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Employees' Retirement 
  System Act of 1986. However, we found that the accounting data containing the 
  recorded amounts of TSP contributions is not periodically reconciled with the 
  underlying source data; reconciliations of TSP cash account balances with the 
  Department of the Treasury cash reports are not being performed each month; 
  the policy for resolving lost TSP earnings is costly and inefficient; eligible 
  employees are not personally notified when they may begin to participate in 
  TSP; and educational programs to explain TSP are not routinely conducted. </p>
