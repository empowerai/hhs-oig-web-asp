<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final audit report, prepared by Price Waterhouse (PW), Certified Public 
  Accountants, points out that PW could not express an opinion on the subject 
  Funds' financial statements. The PW disclaimers of opinion resulted because 
  (1) PW was unable to satisfy themselves as to the reliability of reported account 
  balances for inventory, property and equipment, accounts payable, leased computer 
  equipment, and associated revenue and expenditure accounts and (2) the necessary 
  documentation supporting expenditures in both Funds, and data supporting revenue 
  in the Management Fund, were not available for examination. These problems are 
  primarily attributable to significant weaknesses in internal controls identified 
  in prior audits that remain uncorrected. </p>
