<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Division of Payment Management 
  (DPM) serves as the fiscal intermediary between awarding agencies and grant 
  or contract recipients. The DPM's Payment Management System (PMS) processes 
  approximately $160 billion in payments to recipient organizations per year. 
  The report presents the results of Ernst &amp; Young's (E&amp;Y), certified 
  public accountants, review of DPM's policies and procedures placed in operation 
  to fulfill this responsibility. The E&amp;Y made the review under a HHS Office 
  of Inspector General (OIG) contract. The OIG exercised technical oversight and 
  quality control of the examination. </p>
<p>Specifically, the E&amp;Y examination included procedures to obtain reasonable 
  assurance about whether: (1) the description of the PMS application presents 
  fairly, in all material respects, the aspects of HHS policies and procedures 
  that may be relevant to a user organization's internal control structure; (2) 
  the control structure policies and procedures included in the description were 
  suitability designed to achieve the control objectives specified in the descriptions; 
  and (3) such policies and procedures had been placed in operation as of November 
  30, 1996. </p>
<p>The E&amp;Y concluded that the description of the PMS application presents 
  fairly, in all material respects, the relevant aspects of HHS policies and procedures 
  placed in operation as of November 30, 1996. Also, E&amp;Y concluded that the 
  control structure policies and procedures are suitably designed to provide reasonable 
  assurance that the specified control objectives would be achieved. Lastly, E&amp;Y 
  concluded that the control policies and procedures tested were operating with 
  sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
  that the control objectives specified were achieved during the period April 
  1, 1996 to November 30, 1996. </p>
<p>In our oversight of the examination, we found nothing to indicate that E&amp;Y's 
  work was inappropriate or that the report cannot be relied upon. </p>
<p>This report is intended solely for use by HHS management, its customers, and 
  the independent auditors of its customers. </p>
<p>For Fiscal Year 1997 audit planning purposes, we plan to retain E&amp;Y to 
  perform a similar review covering Fiscal Year 1997 activity. We estimate that 
  the results of the review will be available December 1997.</p>
