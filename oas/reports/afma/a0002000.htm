<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out the results of our review of Fiscal Year (FY) 
  2000 Medicare fee-for-service claims. Based on our statistical sample, we estimate 
  that improper Medicare benefit payments made during FY 2000 totaled $11.9 billion, 
  or about 6.8 percent of the $173.6 billion in processed fee-for-service payments 
  reported by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). As in past years, 
  these improper payments could range from inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud 
  and abuse. Since we developed the first error rate for FY 1996, HCFA has closely 
  monitored Medicare payments and has instituted appropriate corrective actions. 
  The HCFA has also worked with provider groups to clarify reimbursement rules 
  and to impress upon health care providers the importance of fully documenting 
  services. Additional initiatives on the part of the Congress, HCFA, the Department 
  of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General have focused resources on preventing, 
  detecting, and eliminating fraud and abuse. All of these efforts, we believe, 
  have contributed to reducing the improper payment rate by almost half from FY 
  1996 to 2000. However, continued vigilance is needed to ensure that providers 
  maintain adequate documentation supporting billed services, bill only for services 
  that are medically necessary, and properly code claims. These problems have 
  persisted for the past 5 years. Our recommendations address the need for HCFA 
  to sustain its efforts in reducing improper payments. </p>
