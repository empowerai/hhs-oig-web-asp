<p>We audited the statements of financial position of the Public Health Service, 
  Service and Supply Fund (the Fund), a fund within the Department of Health and 
  Human Services, and the related statements of operations and changes in net 
  position (the &quot;Principal Financial Statements&quot;) as of and for the 
  years ended September 30, 1995 and 1994. Our audits were performed in accordance 
  with generally accepted auditing standards Government Auditing Standards, issued 
  by the Comptroller General, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 
  93-06, &quot;Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements&quot; and included 
  related tests of the financial reporting, internal control structure policies 
  and procedures, and of compliance with laws and regulations. Our report on the 
  financial statements and our reports and findings regarding the internal control 
  structure and compliance with laws and regulations follow this summary. This 
  report also includes a description of management's responsibilities, of our 
  responsibilities under the above standards and guidance, and of our methodologies 
  for fulfilling these responsibilities.<br>

    in conformity with the basis of accounting described in the Summary of Significant 
    Account Policies accompanying the financial statements.<br>
