<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of Price Waterhouse's (PW) audit of the Office 
  of the Secretary's Working Capital Fund (Fund) for Fiscal Year 1993. The PW 
  concluded that the Fund's financial statements are presented fairly in conformity 
  with generally accepted accounting principles, except that the fund did not 
  perform an adequate physical inventory of its property and equipment. Appropriate 
  actions, including a physical count of all Fund property, are being taken to 
  correct this deficiency. With regard to compliance with laws and regulations, 
  PW reported that their tests of compliance disclosed no material instances of 
  noncompliance. Finally, PW did recommend needed improvements to some internal 
  controls. </p>
