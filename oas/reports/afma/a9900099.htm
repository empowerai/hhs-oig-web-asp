<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that improper payments under Medicare's fee-for-service 
  system totaled an estimated $12.6 billion during Fiscal Year 1998. This year's 
  estimate of improper payments is $7.7 billion less than last year's estimate 
  of $20.3 billion and $10.6 billion less than the previous year's estimate of 
  $23.2 billion. This decline in improper payments is attributable to several 
  factors: (1) the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) efforts under 
  the Medicare Integrity Program, (2) fraud and abuse initiatives, (3) improved 
  provider compliance with Medicare reimbursement rules, (4) HCFA/OIG outreach 
  efforts emphasizing Medicare documentation requirements, and (5) implementation 
  of HCFA's corrective action plan. Although significant progress has been made, 
  recommendations call for HCFA to continue its diligence in reducing past identified 
  problems and to keep abreast of those issues that could negatively affect future 
  error rates. The HCFA generally concurred with our findings and recommendations.
