<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Division of Computer Research 
  and Technology (DCRT) provides a variety of data processing services on a fee-for-service 
  basis to the National Institutes of Health and other HHS agencies. Ernst &amp; 
  Young's (E&amp;Y), certified public accountants, under contract with the HHS 
  Office of Inspector General, reviewed DCRT's policies and procedures to determine 
  whether: (1) the description of DCRT policies and procedures presents fairly, 
  in all material respects, the aspects of DCRT's policies and procedures that 
  may be relevant to a user organization's internal control structure, (2) the 
  control structure policies and procedures were suitably designed to achieve 
  the control objectives specified in the descriptions, and (3) such policies 
  and procedures had been placed in operation as of September 30, 1997. <br

</p>
<p>The E&amp;Y determined that DCRT is not able to control monitoring and administration 
  of computer machine room access privileges. This resulted in the policies and 
  procedures not being suitably designed to achieve the control objective that 
  states, &quot;Control structure policies and procedures provide reasonable assurance 
  that physical access to the computer center and other sensitive areas, and operations 
  of the computer and related processing equipment is restricted to appropriately 
  authorized individuals.&quot; <br
wp="br1">
</p>
<p>The E&amp;Y concluded that the description of DCRT operations presents fairly, 
  in all material respects, the relevant aspects of DCRT's policies and procedures 
  placed in operation as of September 30, 1997. Also, E&amp;Y concluded that the 
  control structure policies and procedures, except for the matters described 
  in the preceding paragraph, are suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance 
  that the specified control objectives would be achieved. Lastly, E&amp;Y concluded 
  that the control policies and procedures tested were operating with sufficient 
  effectiveness, except for the matters described in the second paragraph above, 
  to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control objectives 
  specified were achieved during the specified period. </p>
