<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report presents the results of Ernst &amp; Young's (certified public accountants) 
  audits of the three subject National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Funds for 
  Fiscal Year 1994. The Ernst &amp; Young auditors reported that they could not 
  express an opinion on each Fund's financial condition because NIH management 
  was unable to provide the auditors with sufficient competent evidential matter 
  to support the material account balances on the statements of financial position. 
  The auditors also reported several significant deficiencies in the design and 
  operation of the internal control structure, and were unable to determine whether 
  management complied with applicable laws and regulations. Ernst &amp; Young 
  recommended that a Fund manager be selected to oversee the; (a) maintenance 
  and preparation of financial statements, (b) drafting of an accounting policies 
  and procedures document, (c) preparation of client assistance supporting schedules, 
  and (d) timely and accurate recording of the Funds' transactions. The NIH officials 
  concurred. </p>
