<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides results of our review of Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 Medicare 
  fee-for-service claims. The objective of this review was to estimate the extent 
  of fee-for-service payments that did not comply with Medicare laws and regulations. 
  Based on our statistically valid sample, we estimate that improper Medicare 
  benefit payments made during FY 1999 totaled $13.5 billion, or about 7.97 percent 
  of the $169.5 billion in processed fee-for-service payments reported by the 
  Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). These improper payments, as in 
  past years, could range from inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and abuse. 
</p>
<p>Since we developed the first error rate for FY 1996, HCFA has demonstrated 
  continued vigilance in monitoring Medicare payments and developing appropriate 
  corrective action plans. In addition, our audit results clearly show that the 
  majority of health care providers submit claims to Medicare for services that 
  are medically necessary, billed correctly, and documented properly. For both 
  FYs 1998 and 1999, we estimated that over 90 percent of fee-for-service payments 
  met Medicare reimbursement requirements. We remain concerned, however, about 
  continuing problems with provider documentation. Documentation errors increased 
  by an estimated $3.4 billion over last year's estimate, largely as a result 
  of errors by home health agencies, durable medical equipment suppliers, and 
  physicians. Our recommendations address the need for HCFA to sustain its efforts 
  in reducing improper payments. </p>
