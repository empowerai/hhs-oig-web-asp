<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether HealthAmerica’s use of its Medicare
  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increase was adequately
  supported and allowable under MMA.&nbsp; HealthAmerica proposed to use the increased capitation
  payments provided under MMA to reduce beneficiary premiums, reduce beneficiary cost sharing,
  and stabilize beneficiary access to providers.&nbsp; HealthAmerica reduced the enrolled beneficiary
  premium from $58 to $50 and eliminated the $100 beneficiary copayment for inpatient stays.&nbsp; By
  eliminating the beneficiary copayment for inpatient stays, plan officials anticipated that
  increased use of inpatient services would eventually result in increased payments to providers.&nbsp; HealthAmerica
  classified this potential increase in payments as “stabilizing beneficiary access to providers,” but
  The Centers for Medicare &amp;&nbsp; Medicaid Services (CMS) defined stabilizing beneficiary
  access to providers as “retaining providers in the Medicare Advantage Organizations network.”&nbsp; CMS
  instructions do allow cost projection updates as allowable non-MMA modifications.&nbsp; Therefore,
  this report contains no recommendations for corrective action.</p>
