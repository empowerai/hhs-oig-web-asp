<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency 
  of&nbsp; Maryland’s procedures for identifying, crediting and reporting the 
  federal financial participation (FFP) of escheated warrants.&nbsp; Our review 
  covered July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2001.&nbsp; We determined that for this 
  period, Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene did not reimburse 
  FFP of:&nbsp; (1) $62,265 in unpresented checks; (2) $10,441 in undeliverable 
  checks; and 3) $6,248 for canceled or deleted checks.&nbsp; We calculated accrued 
  interest of $23,499 for the FFP portion on the escheated warrants.</p>
