<strong>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether documentation available from Highmark for fiscal years 1998 through
  2001 was sufficient to support the payments to subcontractors in accordance with appropriate regulatory guidance, specifically
  48 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 31 – Federal Acquisition Regulation, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures
  and the purchase service agreement between Highmark and its subcontractors.&nbsp; We found the annual reimbursement rates
  for all 12 workload categories billed and the workload statistics for 5 of the 12 workload categories billed to be reasonable,
  allocable, and allowable.&nbsp; We did not resolve the remaining seven workload categories.&nbsp; Although those charges
  appear to be reasonable and allocable, Highmark and its subcontractors were not able to provide complete source documentation
  for the seven workload categories.&nbsp; Failure to provide supporting documentation renders those charges unallowable
  and, in accordance with Clause&nbsp;XIV of the purchase service agreement, subject to “a reduction in price if the cost
  or pricing data is found to be defective.”&nbsp; Consequently, we consider $4,000,689 of the $5,287,739 to be reasonable,
  allocable, and allowable.&nbsp; We are not rendering an opinion on the remaining $1,287,050 that was paid to the subcontractors.&nbsp; </p>
