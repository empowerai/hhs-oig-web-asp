<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>:</p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The audit is one of several reviews of procurements by the 
Program Support Center (PSC) 
and other components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 
response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 
provide, among other things, that HHS agencies award each contract to a 
responsible party and document compliance with requirements for full and open 
competition and the determination that the price was fair and reasonable.</span>&nbsp;</p>

contract to Corporate Lodging Consultants, Inc<span lang="EN">.</span> (CLC), to 
provide corporate lodging services in support of emergency operations during the 
disaster relief efforts.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether PSC complied 
with FAR and HHSAR requirements during the award process involving CLC.&nbsp; PSC 
complied with the requirements.</p>
