<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">From October 1, 1998, through December 31, 2005, the State 
agency reported no program income from undistributable child support 
collections.&nbsp; As of December 31, 2005, the State agency had not reported program 
income totaling $3,276,134 ($2,162,248 Federal share) in undistributable 
collections.&nbsp; The State agency properly reported program income for interest 
earned on undistributed collections.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) transfer $2,842,600 ($1,876,116 Federal 
share) in undistributable child support collections to the Abandoned Property 
Unit and report it as program income, (2) report as program income $433,534 
($286,132 Federal share) in undistributable collections that had already been 
transferred to the Abandoned Property Unit, (3) modify its computer program to 
accurately recognize as abandoned and report undistributable collections as 
program income, and (4) provide training to ensure that State officials follow 
policies and procedures for identifying abandoned property and reporting it as 
program income.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with all of our recommendations.</p>
