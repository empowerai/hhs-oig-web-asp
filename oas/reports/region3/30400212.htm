<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Virginia&rsquo;s method of computing inpatient hospital cost outlier Medicaid payments resulted in reasonable payments.&nbsp;It did not.&nbsp;The State used an outdated cost-to-charge ratio in its calculations.&nbsp;If Virginia had applied a more current cost&#8209;to-charge ratio to convert billed charges to costs, it could have saved approximately $5.8&nbsp;million ($3.0&nbsp;million Federal share) at the three hospitals reviewed.&nbsp;We recommended that Virginia should consider revising the State Medicaid outlier policy to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the most recently settled (tentative or final) cost report and retroactively adjust provider payments for each year based on the actual cost-to-charge ratio calculated for that year.&nbsp;Virginia stated that it did not disagree with our finding but did not concur with the specific recommendations.&nbsp;Although Virginia&rsquo;s actions differ from the audit recommendations, the State has taken administrative steps to reduce the possibility of using cost-to-charge ratios with material misstatements in its rebasing.</p>
