<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that Pennsylvania generally followed the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment methodology
  in the state plan.&nbsp; Such payments totaled $671 million for state fiscal year 2000-2001.&nbsp; Inpatient hospital DSH
  payments totaled $311 million and included payments to acute care general hospitals and freestanding rehabilitation hospitals
  and to Pennsylvania’s Department of Corrections.&nbsp; Mental health DSH payments totaled $361 million and represented
  payments to state-owned institutes for mental diseases, private psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric medical rehabilitation
  and drug and alcohol units of acute care hospitals, and inpatient acute psychiatric care residential treatment facilities.&nbsp; The
  approved state plan allowed for all the preceding DSH payments except for payments to Pennsylvania’s correctional institutions
  for services to inmates (about $3 million).&nbsp; We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
  (CMS) ensure the state comply with CMS’ policy regarding the costs of medical care provided to inmates of correctional
  facilities.</p>
