<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report presents the results of an Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services limited scope
  review to identify and evaluate the processes and procedures to ensure that non-custodial parents’ (NCP) obligations are
  determined and met as primary payers before public funds are used to cover their children’s medical needs as required by
  Section 466(a)(19) of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.&nbsp; We found that Maryland was in general compliance with
  Section 466 and has implemented positive actions to ensure that NCP’s are covering their children’s medical insurance needs.&nbsp; We
  made three procedural recommendations that we believe will make Maryland’s program even more effective.</p>
