<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>In this final report the OIG estimates that widespread violations of Federal criteria by the Pennsylvania Department of
  Public Welfare (DPW) and the Philadelphia Department of Human Services and Family Court resulted in Pennsylvania being
  reimbursed at least $77.6 million in Federal funds for unallowable claims for emergency assistance services and associated
  administrative costs under the Title IV-A emergency assistance program. Of the 330 claims reviewed, 301 violated Federal
  requirements and 166 of the 301 contained 2 or more violations of Federal requirements. We recommended financial adjustments
  for $77.6 million. We also recommended that the Pennsylvania DPW review claims by Philadelphia County and refund inappropriately
  claimed Federal funds for periods subsequent to our audit period and make similar reviews in other Pennsylvania counties.
  The DPW did not concur with our recommendations. </p>
