<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if adequate controls existed to ensure that Health Resources and Services
  Administration (HRSA) adhered to regulations and policies regarding outside activities, financial disclosure, appointment
  of staff fellows and expert consultants, and travel.&nbsp; Our review and testing of HRSA's internal controls revealed
  no evidence of substantive violations of ethics or travel policies.&nbsp; However, we did identify technical lapses related
  to the timeliness and completeness of certain forms and inappropriate policy regarding the supervisory approval chain for
  travel.&nbsp; HRSA officials took corrective action in some areas, and planned to take corrective action in accordance
  with our recommendations in the remaining areas.</p>
