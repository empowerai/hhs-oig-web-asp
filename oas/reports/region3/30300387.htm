<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Office of City Manager, a Ryan White Title I grantee, ensured
  that the Children’s AIDS Network Designed for Interfaith Involvement, Inc. (CANDII), one of its contractors, (1) provided
  the expected program services to clients eligible for Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act Title I and (2)
  followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under CARE Act Title I.&nbsp; The Office of City Manager did not
  ensure that CANDII provided the expected level of services to eligible CARE Act Title I clients; and CANDII did not always
  follow Federal requirements for charging costs to the program.&nbsp; In addition to two procedural recommendations, we
  recommended that the Office of City Manager refund $6,645 to the Federal Government for the amount CANDII improperly charged
  to the CARE Act Title I program.</p>
