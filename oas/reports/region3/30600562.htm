<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the State agency 
claimed Title IV-E administrative costs for foster care candidates on behalf of 
Arlington County partners in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The State 
agency did not comply with Federal requirements when it claimed Title IV-E 
administrative costs totaling $1,744,137 (Federal share) for foster care 
candidates on behalf of Arlington County partners.<span lang="EN"><br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency </span>refund $1,327,149 ($1,744,137 less 
$416,988 previously disallowed by ACF) in unallowable Title IV-E administrative 
costs for foster care candidates claimed by the State agency for Arlington 
County partners for the period April 2002 through March 2004.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In its comments on our draft report, the State agency generally concurred with 
our findings.</p>
