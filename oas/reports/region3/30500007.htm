<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether CMS ensured that its Hospital Payment Monitoring
  Program (HPMP) contractors:&nbsp; (1) had appropriate controls to ensure that sampling procedures,
  admission-necessity and DRG validation screenings, and quality control reviews followed established
  procedures and operated effectively; (2) implemented our prior recommendation; and (3) calculated
  and reported all error amounts that the Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) identified
  in the 10 percent sample.&nbsp; CMS generally ensured that its HPMP contractors had appropriate
  controls; however, CMS and its HPMP contractors incorrectly sampled long term care hospital
  claims and did not complete the follow-up process for obtaining medical records.&nbsp; CMS
  did not ensure that an HPMP contractor implemented our recommendation to use CMS PRICER software
  to accurately calculate error amounts for claims with DRGs revised by the QIOs.&nbsp; Also,
  prior to the conclusion of our fieldwork, CMS did not calculate and report any error amounts
  for errors identified and reported by the QIOs during their quality control reviews of 10
  percent of the claims that had passed the initial review.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS direct its HPMP contractors to:&nbsp; (1) establish appropriate
  controls to select a long term care hospital sample in compliance with criteria, (2) use
  CMS PRICER software, and (3) include in future rate calculations the error amounts identified
  by the QIOs during their quality control reviews.&nbsp; In response to our draft report,
  CMS concurred with our first and third recommendation and stated that it would investigate
  the cost benefits of the second.&nbsp; We continue to believe that the HPMP contractor should
  use CMS’s PRICER software.</p>
