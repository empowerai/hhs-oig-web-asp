<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service claims paid in Virginia during the 3-year
  period of January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 for incarcerated beneficiaries were in compliance with federal regulations
  and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.&nbsp; The Commonwealth of Virginia was one of the 10
  states selected for review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found 81 claims in our 100-claim sample were for beneficiaries who were found to be not guilty by reason of insanity
  (NGRI) and were in State-operated psychiatric hospitals.&nbsp; Virginia law deems these beneficiaries to be “patients” rather
  than “prisoners”.&nbsp; As such, under Virginia law these beneficiaries are responsible for their health care costs.&nbsp; Under
  current CMS guidelines, a distinction in legal status of groups of beneficiaries is permissible.&nbsp; The Medicare program
  will be responsible for coverage as long as there is a law requiring the individual in custody to pay for medical services
  and the government entity enforces the requirements for all individuals in custody with the same legal status.&nbsp; This
  separation of beneficiaries by groups can result in Medicare coverage for one group (in Virginia this group would be the
  NGRIs deemed to be patients) and the non-coverage of another group (in this case those in State or local correctional facilities).&nbsp; Because
  of this dichotomy, we found the majority of payments in our review were allowable.</p>
