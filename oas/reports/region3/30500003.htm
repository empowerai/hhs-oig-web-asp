<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine
  whether Lehigh Valley Hospital (the hospital) complied with Medicare requirements for reporting
  wage data in its FY 2003 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital did not fully comply with
  Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its FY&nbsp;2003 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; Specifically,
  the hospital misstated salaries and hours, which understated wage data by $37,798 and 15,326
  hours; understated excluded area salaries and hours, which overstated wage data by $37,069
  and 1,363 hours; overstated excluded contract services for intern and resident costs, which
  understated wage data by $326; and overstated physician Part A hours, which overstated wage
  data by 52 hours.&nbsp; These errors occurred because the hospital did not sufficiently review
  and reconcile wage data to ensure that all amounts reported were accurate, supportable, and
  in compliance with Medicare regulations and guidance.&nbsp; As a result, the hospital understated
  its wage data by $1,055 and 13,911 hours for the FY 2003 Medicare cost report period.&nbsp; Our
  correction of the hospital’s errors reduced the average hourly wage rate 0.23&nbsp;percent
  from $28.39 to $28.32.&nbsp; We recommended that the hospital implement
  review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage data reported on future Medicare
  cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; The
  hospital concurred with the findings and recommendation.</p>
