<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>From October 1, 1996 to September 30, 2000 Georgetown University (the University) received $424,656 in grant funds from
  the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) for the National Network grant.&nbsp; We were unable to determine if
  the University accomplished the grant objectives because neither ACF nor the University could produce a written agreement
  on grant objectives.&nbsp; Our review disclosed the University had numerous grant accomplishments, complied with standard
  terms and conditions of the grant and was capable of managing Federal funds.&nbsp; However, we found the University’s equipment
  records did not include required identifying information.&nbsp; The University officials did not comment on the equipment
  record weakness.&nbsp; Regarding grant objectives, the University stated their verbal interaction with ACF officials and
  comments on University generated grant documents are evidence of an agreement on grant objectives.&nbsp; </p>
