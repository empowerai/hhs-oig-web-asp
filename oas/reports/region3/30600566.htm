<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">From July 1 through December 31, 2005, the State agency 
made some Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) basic assistance 
payments that did not meet Federal and State requirements and did not adequately 
document all eligibility and payment determinations.&nbsp; Based on the sample 
results, we estimated that the overall TANF improper payment rate was 11.5 
percent of the Federal dollars expended and 16 percent of the number of payments 
made for basic assistance during the 6-month audit period.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) use the results of this review to help 
ensure compliance with Federal and State TANF requirements, (2) determine the 
current eligibility of all recipients identified in this review as improperly 
enrolled in the TANF program and ensure that further assistance is denied for 
those who remain ineligible, and (3) recalculate assistance budgets for all 
recipients identified in this review as having received improperly calculated 
payments.&nbsp; The State agency concurred with all of the recommendations.</p>
