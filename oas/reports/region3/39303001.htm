<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This follow-up audit report points out that peer review organizations (PRO), as reported in our previous audit, continue
  to include unsupported costs in their bid proposals, and at a higher rate than previously reported. We determined that
  of the $770 million of costs proposed by 49 PROs, $266 million, or about 35 percent, was not supported by the necessary
  documentation. We also determined that some PROs continue to have deficiencies in their internal control systems. As a
  result of these continuing problems, we developed a &quot;Proposal Guidance Book&quot; which clarifies in specific detail
  the documentation needed to support proposed costs. We are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration incorporate
  the use of the Proposal Guidance Book in the request for proposal process, require PROs to complete it, attach the required
  documentation, and submit it as part of their bid proposal. </p>
