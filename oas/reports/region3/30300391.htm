<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </b> </p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (State agency)
  properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions by specific focus area designated in
  the cooperative agreements and whether the State agency has established controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipients’ expenditures
  of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funds.&nbsp; We found that the State agency generally accounted for Program
  funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements and applicable departmental regulations
  and guidelines.&nbsp; Specifically, the State agency recorded, summarized and reported transactions by specific focus area.&nbsp; The
  State agency had a system to track and monitor sub-recipient activities; such as, application and award processes, grant
  conditions, ongoing fiscal activities, and reporting.&nbsp; In addition, the State agency was planning to add reviews of
  Program funds to current audits performed on sub-recipients.</p>
