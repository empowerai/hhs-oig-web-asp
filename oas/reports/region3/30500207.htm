<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>:</p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if an allegation submitted to the Office of Inspector General that the Whitman-Walker Clinic conducted medically unnecessary and time-consuming testing procedures that contributed to the medical deterioration and eventual death of an AIDS patient could be substantiated.&nbsp;There was no evidence to substantiate the allegation. The tests performed for the patient were both necessary as a basis for treatment and conducted within acceptable timeframes.&nbsp;Accordingly, there were no recommendations as a result of this audit.</p>
