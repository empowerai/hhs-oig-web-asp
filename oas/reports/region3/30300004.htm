<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed Shady Grove Adventist
  Hospital (Shady Grove) for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Even though physician supervision is assumed
  to be met in an outpatient hospital department, Shady Grove contracted with a physician to supervise the services provided
  by its cardiac rehabilitation program.&nbsp; The physician’s responsibilities included approval of cardiac rehabilitation
  treatment plans and review of patients’ medical records.&nbsp; However, our review disclosed that the physician generally
  was not in the exercise area during regularly scheduled exercise sessions, and he generally did not see the patients.&nbsp; In
  addition, from our specific claims review for a sample of 30 beneficiaries with claims for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation
  services during calendar year 2001, we determined that Shady Grove received Medicare payments of $9,127 for services provided
  to beneficiaries where medical documentation may not have supported Medicare covered diagnoses and for services not otherwise
  allowable.</p>
