<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether claims that the recovery audit contractor (RAC) identified as part of CMS&rsquo;s demonstration project were duplicate payments.&nbsp;None of the 241 claims that the RAC initially identified were duplicate payments.&nbsp;Of the 241 claims, 12 claims included overpayments, totaling $44,746, for six beneficiary stays with 1-day admissions and subsequent same-day readmissions.&nbsp;We recommended that CMS consider the performance of the RAC when reporting to Congress on the demonstration project&rsquo;s impact on Medicare savings and on CMS&rsquo;s decision to expand the project.&nbsp;CMS concurred with our recommendation.</p>
