<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) requested that we determine whether administrative case management costs claimed on behalf of Allegheny County were comparable to those costs claimed on behalf of Philadelphia County.&nbsp;Pennsylvania stated that administrative case management is one of three components of case management and needs to be viewed in total with intensive case management and resource coordination.&nbsp;For our review period, these three case management costs in Allegheny County totaled $399 per client, which was comparable to Philadelphia County totals of $461 per client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also found, contrary to Federal regulations (45 CFR &sect; 95.509), that Pennsylvania did not properly amend its cost allocation plan prior to submitting its initial claim for Federal reimbursement of administrative case management costs.&nbsp;We recommended that CMS:&nbsp;(1) direct Pennsylvania to amend its cost allocation plan in order to claim administrative case management costs and (2) reconsider its acceptance of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s claim for Federal matching funds for administrative case management services provided from January 2002 until a cost allocation plan amendment is submitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania concurred that Allegheny County&rsquo;s costs per client for the three levels of case management compared to Philadelphia.&nbsp;Pennsylvania did not concur that it needed to amend its cost allocation plan and did not agree that CMS should reconsider its acceptance of claims for administrative case management costs.</p>
