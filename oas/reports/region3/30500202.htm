<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Maryland claimed Medicaid administrative costs through
  its cost allocation plan in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and guidance.&nbsp; From
  October 2003 to September 2004, Maryland claimed $50.7 million in Federal funding for Medicaid
  administrative services provided by Department of Human Resources (DHR).&nbsp; Maryland erroneously
  claimed Medicaid administrative costs totaling $666,694 (Federal share).&nbsp; Maryland did
  not amend its cost allocation plan to add 24 cost centers used to distribute DHR costs.&nbsp; Cost
  centers are pools of similar expenses in terms of the functions they benefit.&nbsp; We recommended
  that Maryland:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Federal Government $666,694 in administrative costs
  incorrectly claimed between October 2003 and September 2004; (2) identify additional claims
  made subsequent to our audit period for unapproved cost centers and make the appropriate
  refunds; and (3) discontinue claiming costs that have not been approved as part of the State’s
  cost allocation plan, or amend the State’s cost allocation plan to include all cost centers
  not currently approved.&nbsp; Maryland concurred with our recommendations.</p>
