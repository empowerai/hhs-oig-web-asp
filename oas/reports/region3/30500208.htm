<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Maryland claimed Montgomery County&rsquo;s Medicaid administrative health services costs through its cost allocation plan in accordance with Federal guidance.&nbsp;Maryland&rsquo;s claim of Montgomery County&rsquo;s administrative health service costs conformed to the parameters of the approved cost allocation plan.&nbsp;However, we believe a significant control weakness exists in the current methodology since there is no way to validate that County staff performed the purported Medicaid-related activity generating the claim for Federal matching funds.&nbsp;The county also received an additional $225,023 in Federal matching funds for claiming the enhanced 75-percent rate for administrative services performed by skilled professional medical personnel (SPMP).&nbsp;We do not believe the performance of these activities required the professional education and training necessary for claiming the enhanced SPMP rate.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS determine (1) whether the county's current allocation methodology contains the necessary controls that can assure Medicaid-related activities were performed and (2) whether the county should discontinue claiming enhanced Federal funding for administrative activities performed by SPMPs.&nbsp;Maryland generally disagreed.</p>
