<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate whether the District of Columbia's Medical Assistance Administration (MAA)
  had established adequate accountability and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; Generally, MAA
  had established adequate accountability and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program using Affiliated Computer
  Services (ACS) as its fiscal agent.&nbsp; However, we found that the (1) fiscal year 2002 Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
  Services 64.9R reports were not accurate and included incomplete data; and (2) endorsement stamp used by ACS on drug rebate
  checks was too generic and did not provide for proper security over the checks.</p>
