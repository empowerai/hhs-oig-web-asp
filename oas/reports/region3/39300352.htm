<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally processed error and accident
  reports in accordance with established procedures. However, improvements could be made in the timeliness of the reports
  and the use made of the reports. We recommended that the FDA; (1) expedite the development and issuance of revisions to
  the Federal regulation on error and accident reporting to be more specific concerning the time frame in which error and
  accident reports are required to be submitted, (2) expedite the development and issuance of a regulation to require unlicensed
  blood establishments to submit error and accident reports, and (3) expand the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's
  use of existing information in its current error and accident data base to identify blood establishments that regularly
  fail to submit error and accident reports in a timely manner, and provide additional trend analysis reports to the FDA
  field offices and blood establishments. The Public Health Service agreed with our recommendations. </p>
