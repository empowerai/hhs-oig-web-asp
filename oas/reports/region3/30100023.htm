<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether transition pass-through payments for drugs, biologicals, and medical
  devices were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; Based on our review of payments to Lehigh
  Valley Hospital (LVH) for 100 sampled items, we found, with minor exceptions, that LVH complied with Medicare laws and
  regulations for billing transitional pass-through drugs, biologicals and medical devices.&nbsp; These minor exceptions
  had an insignificant effect on the overall Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; To prevent such errors from occurring in the future,
  we recommend that LVH use the results of our audit to stress to its employees the need to use correct data in generating
  Medicare claims.</p>
