<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>In this final report the OIG estimates that widespread violations of Federal criteria by the Pennsylvania Department of
  Public Welfare (DPW) resulted in Pennsylvania being reimbursed at least $51.5 million in Federal funds for unallowable
  claims for emergency assistance services under the Title IV-A emergency assistance (EA) program. Of the 200 claims reviewed,
  192 violated Federal requirements and 141 of the 192 contained 2 or more violations of Federal requirements. The DPW circumvented
  Federal criteria by disregarding such fundamental principles of the EA program as the child's living arrangement prior
  to applying for assistance, the role of parents/guardians in the application process, making sure services claimed were
  provided, and the 12-month time period in which services could be provided. The EA program was terminated by the Personal
  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which created the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
  block grant. Therefore, we did not make procedural recommendations. We did, however, recommend that DPW refund the $51.5
  million to the Federal Government. The DPW generally did not concur with our findings and recommendation. </p>
