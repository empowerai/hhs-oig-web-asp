<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether WillowBrooke Court was in compliance with Federal
  and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing homes.&nbsp; Based on our review of 92 direct care employees, we found,
  with minor exceptions, that WillowBrooke Court complied with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations.&nbsp; For
  six direct care employees, WillowBrooke Court did not comply with State background check requirements.&nbsp; Although these
  exceptions did not endanger the residents, we recommended WillowBrooke Court review and strengthen its internal controls
  to assure that it obtains State background checks on all new employees and prohibits employees from working directly with
  the residents if the background checks are not received within the required timeframes.</p>
