<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (New Jersey):&nbsp; (1)
  met its Ryan White CARE Act Title II (Title II) service measurement goals, (2) complied with program requirements for the
  expenditure of Title II funds, (3) followed applicable cost requirements in the expenditure of Title II funds.&nbsp; We
  found that New Jersey (1) reported that it did not meet the majority of its service measurement goals, (2) complied with
  program requirements for the expenditure of Title II funds, and (3) complied with applicable cost requirements in the expenditure
  of Title II funds with one minor exception.&nbsp; New Jersey expended Federal funds of $15,704 for 67 duplicate AIDS Drug
  Assistance Program claims.&nbsp; We recommended that New Jersey (1) assure it achieves future service measurement goals,
  and (2) establish procedures to eliminate duplicate payments, credit $15,704 to the Title II program and credit Title II
  for the Federal portion of duplicate claims identified in other grant years.&nbsp; New Jersey concurred with our recommendations.</p>
