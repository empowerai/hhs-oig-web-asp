<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of our fiscal year (FY) 2006 Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP) audit were to determine: (1) whether CMS ensured that the clinical data abstraction contactor (CDAC) and the quality improvement organizations (QIOs) had appropriate controls to ensure that sampling procedures, admission-necessity and diagnosis-related group (DRG) validation screenings, and quality control reviews followed established procedures and operated effectively; (2) the status of initiatives to reduce the HPMP error rate that CMS identified in its November 2005 &ldquo;Improper Fee-For-Service Payments Long Report;&rdquo; and (3) whether CMS took appropriate action on the recommendations made in our FY&nbsp;2005 audit report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CMS ensured that the CDAC and the QIOs had appropriate controls to ensure that sampling procedures, admission-necessity and DRG validation screenings, and quality control reviews followed established procedures and operated effectively.&nbsp;In addition, CMS advised us that it had performed several tasks to accomplish its initiatives to reduce the HPMP error rate.&nbsp;Finally, CMS and its HPMP contractors took appropriate action on the recommendations made in our FY&nbsp;2005 audit report.</p>
