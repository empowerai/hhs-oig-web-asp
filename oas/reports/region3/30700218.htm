<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented 
recommendations made in our previous audit of the Virginia drug rebate program 
and (2) established controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs 
administered by physicians.&nbsp; We found the State agency implemented the 
recommendations from our prior audit when it implemented its new Medicaid 
Management Information System.&nbsp; However, this new system did not allow the 
State agency 
to post to the National Drug Code level rebates received for periods prior to 
implementation.&nbsp; The State agency has established controls and 
accountability for collecting rebates on single source drugs.&nbsp; We 
recommended that the state agency implement a policy to ensure that its accounting 
records reconcile with account receivables reported on the quarterly Form 
CMS-64.9.&nbsp; The State concurred with our finding.</p>
