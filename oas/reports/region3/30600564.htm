<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (the State 
agency) did not always claim Title IV-E maintenance and associated 
administrative costs for Philadelphia County in accordance with Federal 
requirements.&nbsp; Of the 100 maintenance claims sampled, which were based on per 
diem rates exceeding $300, 45 were unallowable.&nbsp; Based on the sample results, we 
estimated that the State agency improperly claimed at least $11,693,989 of the 
total $33,282,491 (Federal share) claimed for Title IV-E reimbursement on behalf 
of Philadelphia County contractors that received per diem rates exceeding $300.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
We were unable to determine the allowability of the remaining $21,588,502 
claimed by the State agency because the contractors’ per diem rates did not 
distinguish between services that were eligible or ineligible for Title IV-E 
reimbursement.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the 
Federal Government $11,693,989; (2) work with ACF to determine the allowability 
of the remaining $21,588,502 claimed; (3) work with ACF to identify and resolve 
any unallowable claims made after September 2002 and refund the appropriate 
amount; (4) discontinue claiming Title IV-E reimbursement for unlicensed 
facilities and ineligible children and services; and (5) direct Philadelphia 
County to develop rate-setting procedures that separately identify maintenance 
and other costs, including related administrative costs, so that claims are 
readily allocable to the appropriate Federal, State, and local funding sources.&nbsp; 
The State agency disagreed with all of the recommendations.</p>
