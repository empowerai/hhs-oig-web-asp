<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether:&nbsp; (1) CMS and AdvanceMed had appropriate controls
  to ensure that AdvanceMed followed established procedures in making medical review decisions
  and adequately maintained, updated, and reported the results of those reviews; (2) CMS and
  AdvanceMed had implemented a prior recommendation to complete the Comprehensive Error Rate
  Testing (CERT) quality assurance program; and (3) CMS had ensured consistency and coordination
  of the error rate programs.&nbsp; CMS and AdvanceMed generally had appropriate controls to
  ensure that AdvanceMed followed procedures and adequately maintained, updated, and reported
  results.&nbsp; CMS could do more to ensure consistency and coordination of the error rate
  programs.&nbsp; Sampling periods were not consistent, and management of the programs was
  decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS:&nbsp; (1) work to establish CERT and Hospital Payment Monitoring
  Program sample periods that are more consistent with each other and more closely aligned
  with the fiscal year and (2) consider centralizing the management of the error rate programs
  under a single office.&nbsp; CMS concurred with the findings and recommendations.</p>
