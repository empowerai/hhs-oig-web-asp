<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p>TrailBlazer Health Enterprises (TrailBlazer) overpaid providers $40,000 for 
two of the three high-dollar payments ($10,000 or more) for calendar years (CY) 
2003-05.&nbsp; The remaining payment was appropriate. TrailBlazer, the Medicare 
Part B carrier for Delaware, processed three high-dollar payments during the 
audit period.&nbsp; Providers refunded the two overpayments prior to our 
fieldwork. <br>
<br>
We recommended that TrailBlazer consider identifying and recovering any 
additional overpayments made to providers for high-dollar Part B claims paid 
after CY 2005.&nbsp; TrailBlazer stated that it had implemented multiple internal 
controls since 2003, including the addition of an edit to review high-dollar 
Part B claim in June 2005.&nbsp; However, because it does not receive funding to do 
so, it would not identify and recover any additional overpayments for 
high-dollar Part B claims paid after CY 2005.</p>
