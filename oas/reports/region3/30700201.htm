<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Delaware generally claimed reimbursement for services 
provided to Hurricane Katrina evacuees in accordance with its approved section 
1115 demonstration project.&nbsp; Of the $173,436 claimed, $164,145 was allowable.&nbsp; 
However, the State claimed a net total of $9,291 in unallowable reimbursement 
for three applicants who did not meet the demonstration project’s displacement 
requirements.&nbsp; These applicants had identified themselves as from the hurricane 
area, but the State had no documentation or verification from the home State 
that their displacement status was valid.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
<br>
We recommended that the State refund the $9,291 in unallowable reimbursement and 
revise its Form CMS-64.9 Waiver reports for Louisiana and Mississippi by the 
audit adjustment amounts.&nbsp; The State said that it could not refute the finding 
but stood by its eligibility determinations.</span></p>
