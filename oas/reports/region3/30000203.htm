<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Under current Medicaid law, States can establish payment methodologies that allow for enhanced payments to non-State owned
  government providers, such as county nursing facilities. This final report points out that Pennsylvania is not using this
  provision for such purposes. Instead, Pennsylvania used the program as a financing mechanism designed solely to maximize
  Federal Medicaid reimbursements, thus effectively avoiding Medicaid's Federal/State matching requirements. Since Fiscal
  Year 1992, the State has generated $3.1 billion in Federal matching funds without any corresponding increase in services
  to the Medicaid residents of county nursing facilities. Further, in the last 3 years a significant percentage (about 21
  percent) of the FFP generated was not even budgeted for Medicaid purposes, and another 29 percent remained unbudgeted and
  available to Pennsylvania for non-Medicaid related use. We recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration move
  quickly to place a control on the overall financing mechanisms being used by States to circumvent the Medicaid program
  requirement that expenditures be a shared Federal/State responsibility, and that the enhanced funding be used for the direct
  health care benefit of Medicaid patients in county nursing facilities. The HCFA concurred and is taking action to curtail
  this problem. </p>
