<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Office of City Manager, a Ryan White Title I grantee, ensured
  that the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), one of its contractors, (1) provided the expected program services to
  clients eligible for CARE Act Title I and (2) followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under CARE Act Title
  I.&nbsp; The Office of City Manager did not ensure that EVMS provided the expected level of services to eligible CARE Act
  Title I clients, and EVMS did not always follow Federal requirements for charging costs to the program.&nbsp; In addition
  to two procedural recommendations, we recommended that the Office of City Manager refund $210,057 to the Federal Government
  for the amount EVMS improperly charged to the CARE Act Title I program.&nbsp; While the Office of City Manager concurred
  with our findings and recommendations, EVMS took exception to our findings.</p>
