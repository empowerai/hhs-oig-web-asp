<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether:&nbsp; (1) services that IDTFs provided to Medicare
  beneficiaries with 100 or fewer services during CY 2001 were (a) reasonable and necessary,
  (b) ordered by a physician, and (c) sufficiently documented in accordance with Federal laws,
  regulations, and guidelines; and, (2) IDTFs operated in accordance with their initial enrollment
  applications and subsequent updates filed with the carriers.&nbsp; Services that IDTFs provided
  to Medicare beneficiaries were not always reasonable and necessary, ordered by a physician,
  or sufficiently documented.&nbsp; Of the 230 sampled beneficiaries, who received 1,804 IDTF
  services, 80 beneficiaries received 1,231 services that did not comply with applicable Federal
  laws, regulations, and guidelines.&nbsp; We also found a marked pattern of repetitive use
  of services.&nbsp; Fifty-five of the sampled beneficiaries accounted for 1,095 of the 1,231
  questioned services.&nbsp; These beneficiaries received their services from IDTFs in California
  and Florida.</p>
<p>Of the 219 IDTFs that provided services to the sampled beneficiaries, 191 did not comply
  with initial enrollment application and subsequent update requirements.&nbsp; IDTFs did not
  report operational changes such as the identity and number of technicians, supervising and
  interpreting physicians, type and model number of equipment, and tests performed.&nbsp; IDTFs
  also failed to report changes in their ownership and location.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS require its carriers to:&nbsp; (1) recover the $164,839 in overpayments
  that we identified; (2) perform follow-up reviews to identify and recover a potential $71.5
  million in improper payments made to IDTFs by the 10 selected carriers, in particular those
  in California and Florida; and (3) consider performing site visits to monitor compliance
  with IDTFs’ initial enrollment applications and subsequent updates should funding become
  available.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In its comments on our draft report, CMS agreed with the first two recommendations subject
  to verification of the overpayments by the Medicare contractors and other conditions.&nbsp; With
  respect to the third recommendation, CMS stated that, because of funding limitations, it
  was not able to require Medicare carriers to conduct site visits to monitor IDTF compliance.&nbsp; While
  we continue to believe that onsite visits are a useful tool to ensure that only legitimate
  IDTFs are enrolled in the Medicare program, we recognize that funding limitations may preclude
  carriers from performing such visits.&nbsp; Accordingly, we have modified our third recommendation
  to acknowledge those funding limitations.</p>
