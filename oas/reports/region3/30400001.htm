<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether Medicare payments to Raytel Cardiac
  Services, Inc. for trans-telephonic cardiac monitoring services were allowable and made in
  accordance with applicable Federal regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; We found that Raytel
  received improper payments totaling $12,315 in calendar year 2002.&nbsp; These improper payments
  included (1) $11,666 in duplicate payments for services that were reimbursed under both a
  local procedure code and a Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, and (2) $649 for services
  that did not comply with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; We did not question Medicare reimbursements
  for the services performed by Raytel technicians who lacked certification or licenses from
  a State or national accreditation body.&nbsp; The States in which Raytel operated did not
  require licenses for pacemaker technicians, and the carrier did not issue guidelines for
  certification until after our audit period.</p>
<p>We recommended that Raytel:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Medicare carrier $12,315 for duplicate
  payments received for billing the same service using both a local procedure code and a CPT
  code, and for services that did not comply with Federal regulations or Medicare guidelines,
  (2) examine the errors identified in our review and develop additional controls and training
  to ensure that these types of errors do not occur in the future, and (3) work with the carrier
  to ensure that its pacemaker training program is in compliance with the carrier guidelines
  for trans-telephonic monitoring personnel.&nbsp; Raytel did not concur with our findings
  as stated in the draft report.&nbsp; Raytel refunded $11,788 of the $12,315 it received in
  duplicate payments and payments for services improperly billed.</p>
