<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, we 
estimated that Maryland paid $2 million ($1 million Federal share) for Medicaid 
services provided to beneficiaries who should not have been eligible owing to 
their Medicaid eligibility/residence in the District of Columbia and $347,000 
($173,000 Federal share) for Medicaid services provided to beneficiaries whose 
residence could not be determined.&nbsp; Both Maryland and the District of Columbia 
require that Medicaid beneficiaries be residents.<br>
<br>
We recommended that Maryland work with the District of Columbia to share 
information for use in determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status and 
reducing the amount of payments made on behalf of beneficiaries residing in the 
District of Columbia.&nbsp; We also recommended that the State determine the place of 
residence associated with beneficiaries whose residency could not be established 
and verify addresses of all beneficiaries.&nbsp; The State generally concurred with 
our recommendations but not with verifying the addresses of beneficiaries on 
Supplemental Security Income or the amount of estimated savings, and it cited 
Federal regulations that required it to pay for some beneficiaries who were not 
residents of the State.&nbsp; Because the State did not cite specific cases that it 
disagreed with, we continue to support our recommendations and the estimated 
savings.</p>
