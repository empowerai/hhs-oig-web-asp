<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Office of City Manager, a Ryan White Title I grantee, ensured
  that the Norfolk Community Services Board (NCSB), one of its contractors, (1) provided the expected program services to
  clients eligible for CARE Act Title I and (2) followed Federal requirements for claiming program costs under CARE Act Title
  I.&nbsp; The Office of City Manager did not ensure that NCSB provided the expected level of program services to eligible
  CARE Act Title I clients or followed Federal requirements for charging program costs.&nbsp; In addition to one procedural
  recommendation, we recommended that the Office of City Manager refund $12,291 to the Federal Government for the amount
  inappropriately paid to NCSB.</p>
