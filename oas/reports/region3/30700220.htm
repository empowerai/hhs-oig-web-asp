<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For fiscal years 2004 and 2005, West Virginia claimed 
$286,000 in Medicaid reimbursement for a duplicate prior period adjustment and 
for prescription drugs that were ineligible for reimbursement.&nbsp; The 
Medicaid drug rebate program generally pays for covered outpatient drugs if 
their manufacturers have rebate agreements with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
Services (CMS) and pay rebates to the States.&nbsp; Under the drug rebate program, 
CMS provides the States with a quarterly Medicaid drug tape, which the States 
use to verify coverage of the drugs for which they claim reimbursement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An additional $2.1 million represented expenditures for 
drug products that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes.&nbsp; Because the 
Department of Health and Human Resources (the State agency) did not verify whether these drugs were eligible for coverage, 
these expenditures may not have been allowable.&nbsp; We identified no other errors 
for the remainder of the $808 million ($615 million Federal share) that the 
State claimed.</p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">We recommended 
that the State (1) refund $286,000 to the Federal Government for a duplicate 
prior period adjustment and for drug expenditures that were not eligible for 
Medicaid coverage, (2) work with CMS to resolve $2.1 million in payments for 
drugs that were not listed on the quarterly drug tapes and that may not have 
been eligible for Medicaid coverage, and (3) strengthen internal controls to 
ensure that claimed Medicaid drug expenditures comply with Federal 
requirements.&nbsp; The State agreed with our recommendations</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; ">.</span>
