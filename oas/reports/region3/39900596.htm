<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>In this final report the OIG estimates that widespread violations of Federal criteria by the Pennsylvania Department of
  Public Welfare (DPW) resulted in Pennsylvania being reimbursed at least $42.4 million in Federal funds for unallowable
  claims for emergency assistance services and associated administrative costs under the Title IV-A emergency assistance
  program. Of 300 claims reviewed, 251 violated Federal requirements and 141 of the 251 contained 2 or more violations. The
  DPW circumvented Federal criteria by disregarding such fundamental principles of the EA program as the child's living arrangements
  prior to applying for assistance, the role of parents/guardians in the application process, and the 12-month time period
  in which services could be provided. The EA program was terminated by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
  Reconciliation Act of 1996, which created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant. Therefore, we did not
  make procedural recommendations. We did, however, recommend that DPW refund the $42.4 million to the Federal Government.
  The DPW generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations. </p>
