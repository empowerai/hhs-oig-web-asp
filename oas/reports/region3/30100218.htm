<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report presents the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audit Services (OAS),
  limited scope review to identify and evaluate the processes and procedures to ensure that the non-custodial parents' (NCP)
  obligations are determined and met as primary payers before public funds are used to cover their children's medical needs
  as required by Section 466(a)(19) of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.&nbsp; We found that West Virginia was in general
  compliance with Section 466 and has implemented positive actions to ensure that NCP's are covering their children's medical
  insurance needs.&nbsp; We made three procedural recommendations that we believe will make West Virginia's program even
  more effective.</p>
