<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the University of Virginia Medical Center overstated its uncompensated care costs (UCC)
  in state fiscal years 1997 and 1998 by including unallowable costs consisting of physician practice plan costs incurred
  by a related entity. As a result, disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments exceeded UCC costs by $9.2 million ($4.8
  million federal share).&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment for the $4.8 million and procedural corrections.&nbsp; State
  officials generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
