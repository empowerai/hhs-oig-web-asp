<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) methodology for developing adjusted
  community rate proposals (ACRP) (developed by managed care organizations (MCO) to claim administrative costs) results in
  Medicare paying a disproportionate share of such costs. Five of the nine MCOs included in our reviews overestimated their
  administrative costs by an average of 100 percent. The five MCOs proposed costs totaling $231.9 million and incurred costs
  totaling only $115.7 million, for an excess of $116.2 million. Further, the nine MCOs claimed $66.3 million which would
  have been recommended for disallowance had the MCOs been required to follow Medicare's general principle of paying only
  reasonable costs. We recommended that HCFA pursue legislation that would require MCOs to follow Medicare's general principle
  of paying only reasonable costs or establish a cap on administrative costs. We also recommended that HCFA consider publishing
  the administrative cost rates of all MCOs participating in the Medicare program. This would provide information to Medicare
  beneficiaries aimed at helping them become more educated consumers of health care services. </p>
