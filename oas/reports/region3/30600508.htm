<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The audit is one of several reviews of procurements by the 
Program Support Center (PSC) and other components of the Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 
provide, among other things, that HHS agencies award each contract to a 
responsible party and document compliance with requirements for full and open 
competition and the determination that the price was fair and reasonable.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of HHS’s hurricane relief operations, PSC awarded a 
contract to North Central Texas Services, Inc<span lang="EN">.</span>, which 
operates under the name “CareFlite.”&nbsp; The contract obligated CareFlite to 
furnish transportation services for evacuated medical patients who required 
medical care from their places of evacuation to their original locations.&nbsp; Our 
objective was to determine whether PSC complied with FAR and HHSAR requirements 
during the award process involving CareFlite.&nbsp; PSC complied with the 
requirements.</p>
