<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p></strong> 



<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The West 
Virginia Bureau for Medical Services (State agency) claimed and was reimbursed 
the Federal enhanced rate for 38&nbsp;individuals improperly classified as skilled 
professional medical personnel.&nbsp; Those individuals did not meet the definition 
of “skilled professional medical personnel” as defined in the Social Security 
Act and implementing Medicaid regulation.&nbsp; As a result, the 
State agency received Medicaid overpayments for fiscal year&nbsp;2003 totaling $296,485 for 
individuals and $2,875 for non-compensation expenditures that did not meet the 
criteria of skilled professional medical personnel.&nbsp; We recommended that the State 
agency refund $299,360, and implement procedures to properly classify skilled 
professional medical personnel.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and State 
agency generally agreed with our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; However, the 
State agency reclassified 11 individuals who were claimed and reimbursed at the 
Federal enhanced rate for skilled professional medical personnel as Medicaid 
Management Information System operations personnel in order to retain the 
Federal enhanced rate.</span></p>
