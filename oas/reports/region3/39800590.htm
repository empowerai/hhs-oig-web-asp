<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if DPW identified all costs associated with children in the DHS juvenile
  justice system on its claims for Federal Financial Participation (FFP) submitted to the United States Department of Health
  and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Proper identification of these costs was necessary
  so that ACF could disallow them in accordance with its policy dated September 12, 1995. This policy stated that FFP was
  not available under the EA program, effective January 1, 1996, for costs associated with children in the juvenile justice
  system. </p>
<p>Our review showed that DPW continued to claim FFP for services provided to children in the Philadelphia DHS juvenile justice
  system after January 1, 1996, and did not properly identify $26 million of these costs on its claims for FFP. As a result,
  ACF was unable to disallow these costs and DPW was reimbursed FFP of about $13 million for services provided to children
  in the Philadelphia DHS juvenile justice. </p>
