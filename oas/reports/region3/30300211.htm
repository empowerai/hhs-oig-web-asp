<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out that the States controls were not adequate to prevent improper Medicaid
  payment to nursing homes that were under a denial of payment sanction.&nbsp; Title XIX, section 1919, of the Social Security
  Act and 42 CFR § 488 require that the State establish adequate controls over the mandatory denial of payment sanction.&nbsp; Of
  the 73 nursing homes that were sanctioned during our audit period, 13&nbsp;received unallowable Medicaid payments for new
  admission residents because the State Medicaid agency had not implemented pre&#8209;payment edits or post-payment reviews
  during the period of our review to ensure that only allowable services were paid to nursing homes.&nbsp; As a result, the
  State Medicaid agency made Medicaid payments totaling $75,342 (Federal share $40,553) to the 13&nbsp;nursing homes for
  residents who were admitted during the sanction periods.&nbsp; We also noted that 101 of 653 Medicaid certified nursing
  homes surveyed by the State received a deficiency with a scope and severity code that required a denial of payment sanction
  that were not identified on the CMS and State lists of sanctioned nursing homes.&nbsp; The denial of payment sanction was
  warranted because those nursing homes had not reached substantial compliance within 3&nbsp;months of having the deficiency
  identified by the State survey agency.&nbsp; As a result, the State could have made Medicaid payments to those nursing
  homes for new admissions during those sanction periods because they had not identified them as requiring a mandatory denial
  of payment sanction.</p>
