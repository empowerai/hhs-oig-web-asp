<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>






<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">Our objectives were 
to (1) consolidate the results of our audits of seven States’ methodologies for 
claiming the costs of family planning services provided through Medicaid managed 
care programs and (2) assess the adequacy of CMS’s guidance and practices 
relative to determining such costs.<br>
<br>
Six of the seven States we reviewed inflated the factors or rates used to claim 
reimbursement for family planning costs at the enhanced 90-percent rate or did 
not provide documentation to support their calculations as required.&nbsp; As a 
result, for $302,902,257 in claims reviewed (Federal share), these States 
claimed unallowable costs totaling $21,749,383 (Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended 
that CMS: (1) issue specific guidance to State agencies, consistent with current 
Medicaid regulations, to quantify a reasonable portion of the capitation 
payments attributable to family planning services; (2) establish controls in its 
review process to ensure that the data States use to quantify family planning 
costs conform to the proposed methodologies for claiming the enhanced family 
planning rate; and (3) specify retention requirements for base-year data.&nbsp; CMS 
agreed with our first and third recommendations.&nbsp; We clarified our second 
recommendation to express our original intent more clearly.</p>
