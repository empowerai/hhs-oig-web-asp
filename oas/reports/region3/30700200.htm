<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the $1.3 million that Maryland claimed for services 
provided to Hurricane Katrina evacuees as of March 31, 2007, $412,000 did not 
comply with the State’s approved hurricane-related section 1115 demonstration 
project.&nbsp; Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the State was allowed 
to provide the benefits included in its State Medicaid plan to eligible 
Hurricane Katrina evacuees for a maximum of 5&nbsp;months.&nbsp; The $412,000 claimed was 
not allowable because it was not supported by actual recorded expenditures or 
because it was for services provided to individuals whose eligibility had 
expired or who may not have met eligibility requirements.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State refund $412,000 in unallowable reimbursement and 
revise its waiver reports for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi by our audit 
adjustment amounts.&nbsp; The State agreed with our recommendation.</p>
