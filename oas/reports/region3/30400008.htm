<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP) primarily
  to establish the Medicare fee-for-service paid claims error rate for inpatient acute care hospital services.&nbsp; The
  objectives of this audit were to determine whether (1) HPMP controls were adequate to ensure that contractors followed
  established procedures for admission-necessity and diagnosis-related group (DRG) validation screenings and for quality
  control reviews and (2) HPMP contractors accurately calculated and reported the net error amounts for claims with DRG coding
  changes made by the quality improvement organizations.&nbsp; The HPMP contractors generally had appropriate controls to
  ensure that admission-necessity and DRG validation screenings and quality control reviews were performed in accordance
  with established procedures.&nbsp; As to our second objective, the methodology for calculating net error amounts was not
  accurate for some of the claims we reviewed.&nbsp; Our calculation of the net error amounts for DRG coding changes was
  based on CMS's standard pricing information (known as PRICER software).&nbsp; An HPMP contractor, on the other hand, used
  an alternate methodology, which was not always accurate.&nbsp; Nevertheless, our sample projection showed that the net
  error amount differences were not significant in relation to the HPMP projection of erroneous Medicare payments for FY
  2004.&nbsp; We recommended that CMS direct the HPMP contractors to use the most current PRICER software to calculate error
  amounts for DRGs revised by the quality improvement organizations.&nbsp; CMS officials agreed with the audit results and
  the recommendation.</p>
