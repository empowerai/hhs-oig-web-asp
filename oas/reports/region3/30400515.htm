<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p>The objectives of our review of Pennsylvania Protection &amp; Advocacy, Inc. 
(PP&amp;A) were to assess its procurement practices, assess potential conflicts of 
interest, and evaluate PP&amp;A's monitoring of its contractors.&nbsp;  
PP&amp;A had contracting practices that did not reflect the use of open competition 
as required by Federal law; had two situations that involved conflicts of 
interest in violation of Federal law; and did not comply with Federal 
regulations in monitoring its legal services contractors because it did not verify that 
contractor costs billed were allowable, allocable, and reasonable.</p>
<p>We recommended that PP&amp;A (1) use open competition in procuring legal 
services contracts or stop sole source contracting and establish in-house legal 
services expertise; (2) require its executive director to terminate her 
conflicting employment relationship; (3) decline acceptance of future 
contributions from any of its contractors; and (4) ensure that it complies 
with Federal regulations in monitoring contractor billings.&nbsp; PP&amp;A concurred 
with our recommendations, but disagreed with the repayment part of the third 
recommendation, saying that its recent merger with the contractor would nullify 
repayment.&nbsp; Accordingly, we modified our third recommendation.</p>
