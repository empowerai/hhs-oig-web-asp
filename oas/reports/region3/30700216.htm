<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:40.0pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Our objectives were to 
determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented the recommendations made 
in our previous audit of the District’s drug rebate program and (2) established 
controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by 
physicians.&nbsp; The State agency implemented the recommendations from our 
prior audit.&nbsp; However, the State agency did not collect rebates on single 
source drugs administered by physicians or establish controls over and 
accountability for their collection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the State agency (1) implement policies 
and procedures to collect and submit utilization for single source drugs 
administered by physicians so that the District may obtain rebates for the drugs 
and (2) collect rebates for single source drugs, retroactive 
to January 1, 2006, when it implements its single source drug rebate program.&nbsp;
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The State agency concurred with our findings and stated that 
it plans to adhere to our recommendations.</span></p>
