<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>From October 1996 through September 2000, the National Adoption Center (NAC) received $2 million in grant funding from
  the Administration for Children and Families to establish an Internet National Adoption Information Exchange.&nbsp; We
  found that NAC was able to accomplish all grant objectives and was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant
  and was capable of managing Federal funds.&nbsp; However, we found internal control weaknesses related to the lack of segregation
  of duties and a bank balance in excess of FDIC coverage.&nbsp; The NAC stated that the size of its accounting operation
  made it impractical to fully segregate accounting functions and the excess balance was an unusual one-time occurrence.</p>
