<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to review the financial practices and transactions relative to the Head
  Start grant awarded to Juniata County Child Care and Development Services, Inc. (Juniata)
  for the period February 1, 2004, through January 31, 2005.&nbsp; Of $889,733 recorded costs
  for the Head Start program, we did not accept and recommend for adjustment $108,905 comprising
  of $90,000 used improperly to pay off a line of credit bank debt established during the previous
  grant year and $18,905 of unallowable and unsupported costs.&nbsp; We also set aside $44,307
  for Administration for Children and Families (ACF) adjudication because Juniata did not provide
  adequate documentation to support this amount.&nbsp; Since Juniata relinquished its grant,
  we recommended that ACF:&nbsp; (i) require Juniata to refund $90,000 of 2005 grant funds
  used to improperly pay off a line of credit bank debt established during the prior year;
  (ii) require Juniata to refund $18,905 of unsupported and/or unallowable costs; and (iii)
  make a determination on the acceptance of $44,307 for set-aside costs that did not have sufficient
  supporting records for us to determine allowability.</p>
