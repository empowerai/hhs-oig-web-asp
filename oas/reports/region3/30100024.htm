<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether transitional pass-through payments received by Saint Mary&#146;s
  Hospital for drugs, biologicals, and medical devices were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.&nbsp; Saint
  Mary&#146;s Hospital located in Richmond, Virginia is part of the Bon Secours Richmond Health System (BSRHS).&nbsp; The
  BSRHS processes all billing and reimbursements of pass-through items used by Saint Mary&#146;s Hospital.&nbsp; Based on
  our review of payments for 100 sampled items, we found, with minor exceptions, that BSRHS complied with Medicare laws and
  regulations for billing transitional pass-through drugs, biologicals and medical devices.&nbsp; These minor exceptions
  had an insignificant effect on the overall Medicare reimbursement. However, to prevent such errors from occurring in the
  future, we recommended that BSRHS use the results of our audit to stress to its employees the need to use correct data
  in generating Medicare claims.</p>
