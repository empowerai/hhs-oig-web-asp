<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this self-initiated audit was to determine whether the University of Maryland
  Medical Center (Medical Center) complied with Medicare and Maryland laws, regulations, and
  guidelines for allocating costs to organ acquisition and for maintaining adequate documentation
  to support those costs, and to estimate the effect on Medicare reimbursement for State Fiscal
  Year (SFY) 2003 when costs claimed were unallowed or unsupported.&nbsp; The Medical Center
  did not always comply with Medicare laws, regulations, and guidelines for reporting its costs,
  including organ acquisition costs, to the Commission.&nbsp; Specifically, the Medical Center
  did not have systems that could allocate organ acquisition costs separately from non-organ
  acquisition costs and other hospital activities.&nbsp; Because the Medical Center did not
  properly allocate costs totaling $2,562,132 between organ acquisition and all other cost,
  higher organ reimbursement rates resulted.&nbsp; We estimated that the Medicare portion of
  those costs is approximately 40&nbsp;percent, or $1,024,852.&nbsp; We recommend that the
  Commission ensure that the Medical Center adheres to Medicare laws, regulations, and guidelines
  by properly identifying organ acquisition costs in the cost data provided to the Commission.&nbsp; In
  its written comments to our draft report, the Commission, the Medical Center, and the Centers
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
