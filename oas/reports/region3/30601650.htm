<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Senate Finance Committee requested that we assess the 
fiscal integrity of the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) with 
respect to six specified fiscal integrity areas.&nbsp; We found that from 
November 1, 2002, through October 31, 2005, Maryland’s QIO incurred 
approximately $1.6 million of costs that were improperly classified as indirect 
costs.&nbsp; These costs included direct costs totaling $89,026 for recruiting that 
should have been charged to the QIO contract and rents and other costs totaling 
$1,548,509 attributable to specific contracts with State governments that should 
not have been included in the indirect costs. &nbsp;Because indirect costs are used 
to calculate the indirect cost rates, inflating these costs may have resulted in 
inflated indirect costs charged to this scope of work (SOW).<br>
<br>
We recommended that the QIO work with CMS to resolve the status of the 
$1,637,535 in questioned indirect costs as part of the final settlement of the 
SOW.&nbsp; The QIO took exception to our recommendation but stated that it was 
changing its accounting practices.</p>
