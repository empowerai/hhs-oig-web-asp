<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to analyze 18 Expenditure Adjustments from the Title IV-E Castille
  maintenance placement claims to determine if they were correctly calculated and supported by claim
  documentation.&nbsp; Of the $18.3 million Federal share claimed by the Department of Public Welfare
  (DPW) from October 1997 through September 2002 $609,681 was not allowable.&nbsp; The Commonwealth of
  Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania) claimed 9,002 days of care for children who did not meet Federal requirements
  for eligibility.&nbsp; Claims for these ineligible children amounted to $517,191 FFP.&nbsp; Pennsylvania
  did not provide documentation to support expenditures of $92,490 FFP under the Castille facility accounting
  codes.&nbsp; We recommended Pennsylvania refund unallowable foster care maintenance placement costs
  in the amount of $609,681 claimed under the Castille program.&nbsp; The State concurred with the first
  finding but not the second, claiming some records were located after the audit and others destroyed.&nbsp; We
  contend that the claim was submitted within the 3-year record retention period.</p>
