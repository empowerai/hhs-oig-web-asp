<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if costs incurred by The National Association of Protection &amp; Advocacy
  Systems, Inc. (NAPAS) during the period September 25, 1999 through September 24, 2000 were claimed in accordance with Federal
  requirements.&nbsp; During the contract period, NAPAS received payments of $1,999,518.&nbsp; Our review determined that
  $12,091 of the cost reimbursed by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) was unsupported or unallowable.&nbsp; In
  addition, NAPAS could not document that funds received for The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) project
  were used for their intended purpose.&nbsp; The NAPAS could not account for $123,280 of the $200,000 that it retained to
  administer the CMS Project.&nbsp; In this regard, we found that NAPAS was not required, by ADD in its contract, to separately
  account for the CMS funds or the other appropriations.&nbsp; We recommend that NAPAS:&nbsp;(1) refund $12,091 of unsupported
  or unallowable cost charged to the ADD contract; (2) establish procedures to account for each Federal appropriation separately;
  and (3) refund to ADD $123,280 in unsupported CMS project funds.</p>
