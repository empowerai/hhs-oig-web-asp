<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>As demonstrated in a previous review (A-03-98-00046), this final report points out that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
  Services&#146; (CMS) methodology for developing adjusted community rate proposals (ACRP) (developed by managed care organizations
  (MCO) to claim administrative costs) still results in Medicare paying a disproportionate share of such costs. Our audits
  of the ACRPs prepared by 10 MCOs in nine States showed that $97.1 million of base year costs would have been recommended
  for disallowance had the MCOs been required to follow the Medicare program&#146;s general principle of paying only reasonable
  costs. Since there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability of costs in the ACRP process, the MCOs
  were not required to adhere to this principle. As recommended in our prior report, we believe legislation is needed that
  would require MCOs to follow Medicare&#146;s general principle of paying only reasonable costs. </p>
