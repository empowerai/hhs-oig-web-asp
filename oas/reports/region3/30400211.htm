<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This is one of a series of audits of State Medicaid outlier payments.&nbsp; Our objective
  was to determine whether Pennsylvania’s method of computing inpatient hospital day outlier
  and cost outlier Medicaid payments resulted in reasonable payments.&nbsp; For the three hospitals
  reviewed, Pennsylvania’s method resulted in reasonable day outlier payments.&nbsp; However,
  it did not result in reasonable cost outlier payments because the State used an outdated
  cost-to-charge ratio in its calculation. </p>
<p>We recommended that Pennsylvania:&nbsp; develop a methodology to monitor the cost-to-charge
  ratio during the fiscal year and adjust the ratio as necessary, and revise the State cost
  outlier policy to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the most recent cost reporting period
  and retroactively adjust provider payments for each year based on the actual cost-to-charge
  ratio calculated for that year.&nbsp; In response to our draft report, the State has taken
  positive actions to update its payment system.</span></p>
