<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report covers the audit of $299,169,893 in Medicare Part B administrative costs claimed by Highmark, Inc, d/b/a
  HGSAdministrators for the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1997.&nbsp; We identified and recommended for adjustment
  $1,224,793 in costs that were either unallowable, unreasonable, or unapproved.&nbsp; We also questioned $640,123 in unsupported
  costs for which documentation supporting the expense was either not provided or proved inadequate to determine the nature,
  type, reasonableness or necessity of the expense.&nbsp; The auditors did not render an opinion on reported Medigap credits
  totaling $478,418 because of the significant amount of unsupported billings. </p>
