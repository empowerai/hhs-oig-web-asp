<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the Department of Public Welfare 
(the State agency) had (1) implemented the recommendations made in our previous 
audit of the Pennsylvania drug rebate program and (2) established controls over 
collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by physicians.</p>
<p>Although the State agency did not concur with our findings, it did implement 
the recommendations made in our previous audit.&nbsp; The State agency 
introduced a new Medicaid Management Information System, the PROMISe System, 
which corrected the weaknesses noted in our prior review.&nbsp; In addition, the 
State agency established controls over collecting rebates on single source drugs 
administered by physicians.&nbsp; Accordingly, we have no recommendations at 
this time.</p>
