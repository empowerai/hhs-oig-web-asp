<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Blue Ridge Care and Rehabilitation Center was in compliance with
  Federal and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing homes.&nbsp; Based on our review of 52 direct care employees,
  Blue Ridge did not comply with the Federal and State staffing laws and regulations that we reviewed.&nbsp; Blue Ridge did
  not schedule direct care employees to ensure there was a registered nurse on duty at least 8 consecutive hours for 5 of
  the days reviewed and sufficient staff to provide 2.25 hours of direct care per resident per day for 3 of the days reviewed.&nbsp; Also,
  Blue Ridge did not maintain personnel records with evidence of a current license or certification for seven direct care
  employees.&nbsp; We recommended that Blue Ridge review and strengthen its internal controls to assure that it schedules
  direct care employees to ensure that there is a registered nurse on duty at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week,
  and enough nursing staff on duty to provide 2.25 hours of direct care per resident per day.&nbsp; We also recommended that
  Blue Ridge maintain evidence of current license or certification status in each direct care employee’s personnel record.&nbsp; Blue
  Ridge concurred with our findings.</p>
