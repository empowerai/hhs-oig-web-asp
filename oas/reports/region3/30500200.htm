<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Calvert Manor Healthcare
  Center was in compliance with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing homes.&nbsp; Based
  on our review of all 114 direct care employees, Calvert Manor Healthcare Center generally complied
  with the Federal and State staffing laws and regulations that we reviewed.&nbsp; A review of the direct
  care employees disclosed that Calvert did not request the background check for 17 direct care employees
  before they were hired.&nbsp; We recommended that Calvert review and strengthen its internal controls
  to assure that it requests State background checks on all new direct care employees before the employees
  are hired.&nbsp; In response to our draft report, Calvert concurred with our findings.</p>
