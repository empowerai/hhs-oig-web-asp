<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:40.0pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Our objective was to 
deter<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">m</span>ine whether CareFirst Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield of Maryland's (CareFirst) claims 
for severance and ter<span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">m</span>ination costs were allowable, reasonable, and alloca<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">b</span><span style="letter-spacing:.05pt">l</span>e, 
in accorda<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">n</span>ce with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the 
Medicare co<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">n</span><span style="letter-spacing:
.05pt">t</span>ract provisions, and CareFirst severance policies.&nbsp; CareFirst 
claimed $1,394,977 in severance and termination costs for the period October 
2005 through December 2006.&nbsp; We did not question $1,362,526 of this amount.&nbsp; 
However, CareFirst claimed $32,451 in unallowable costs.&nbsp; In its comments 
on our draft report, CareFirst concurred with all but one of our findings.&nbsp; 
CareFirst provided additional documentation (letter, invoice, and schedule of 
hours/wages) from AON Consulting to support the professional fees totaling 
$12,024 for services claimed for November 2005.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although CareFirst provided additional information about 
the work performed, it did not document the details of the agreements. 
Therefore, we continue to support our recommendation.</p>
