<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This review was made to determine if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took all required actions regarding 17 error
  and accident reports identified as requiring further evaluation for a blood recall classification. Classification and publication
  of a blood recall generally take place long after the error or accident occurs. Our final report discloses that FDA had
  not processed 5 of the 17 reports in accordance with established procedures. Although errors in processing the 5 reports
  caused delays in classifying the blood recalls, the FDA does not believe the public was placed at additional risk. We recommended
  that FDA improve its tracking system to ensure that all error and accident reports warranting further evaluation for blood
  recall classification are tracked until final resolution. We also recommended that FDA complete the recall classification
  and publication of the 5 error and accident reports identified in our review. The FDA concurred with our recommendations
  and has taken corrective action. </p>
