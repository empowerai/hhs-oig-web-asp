<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>: </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The audit is one of several reviews of procurements by the 
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
and other components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 
response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 
provide, among other things, that HHS agencies award each contract to a 
responsible party and document compliance with requirements for full and open 
competition and the determination that the price was fair and reasonable.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of HHS’s hurricane relief operations, HRSA awarded 
a contract to Collaborative Fusion, Inc<span lang="EN">. (</span>Collaborative 
Fusion).&nbsp; The contract obligated Collaborative Fusion to provide assistance to 
HRSA and the States in setting up a temporary health professional volunteer 
registry.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether HRSA complied with FAR and 
HHSAR requirements during the award process involving Collaborative Fusion.&nbsp; 
HRSA complied with the requirements.</p>
