<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The audit is one of several reviews of procurements by 
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and other components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) 
provide, among other things, that HHS agencies award each contract to a 
responsible party and document compliance with requirements for full and open 
competition and the determination that the price was fair and reasonable.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">SAMHSA identified a need to motivate those affected by 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to take care of their emotional well-being and to 
inform them of available mental health services. &nbsp;To meet this need, SAMHSA 
modified an existing contract with The Advertising Council, Inc<span lang="EN">. 
(</span>the Council). &nbsp;The existing contract obligated the Council to conduct 
national public health campaigns designed to improve the general understanding 
of mental illnesses and emotional disturbances. &nbsp;The m<span lang="EN-GB">odifications 
obligated the Council to furnish radio and television public service 
announcements to reach adult victims of the hurricanes and first responders, as 
well as parents and caregivers who could assess the emotional well-being of 
children affected by the hurricanes. &nbsp;</span>Our objective was to determine 
whether SAMHSA complied with FAR and HHSAR requirements during the award process 
involving the Council.&nbsp; SAMHSA complied with the requirements.</p>
