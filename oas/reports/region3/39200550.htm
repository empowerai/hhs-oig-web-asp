<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) submitted annual applications for Independent Living
  Program (ILP) funds each year since the program was established in Fiscal Year 1987 and was awarded over $1.6 million by
  the Federal Government. Our report points out that DHHR misspent 37 percent of the awarded ILP funds, forfeited use of
  48 percent of the funds, and will forfeit use of the remaining 15 percent of the awarded funds unless major improvements
  are made in its accounting system. Also, DHHR had not established a cost center to control Federal expenditures under the
  Title IV-E ILP, and had not reported a single Federal expenditure to the Administration for Children and Families during
  the 5-year period. </p>
