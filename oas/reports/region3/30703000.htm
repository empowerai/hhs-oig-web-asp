<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">We conducted this review pursuant to section 817 of the 
Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public 
Law&nbsp;109-364).&nbsp; The NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment 
Center (the Center) complied with appropriation statutes and financial 
management regulations for 13 of the 28 task orders that we reviewed but may not 
have complied for the remaining 15 task orders.&nbsp; Also, the Center generally 
complied with acquisition regulations and Governmentwide contract provisions.&nbsp; 
However, the Center did not always maintain adequate documentation with respect 
to acquisition planning, competition, award decisions, and contractor 
monitoring.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">We recommended that<b> </b></span>the 
Center<span lang="EN"> (1) </span>work with the Department of Defense (Defense) 
to resolve the obligation of $11.8&nbsp;million in operations and maintenance funds 
instead of research, development, testing, and evaluation funds for 4 task 
orders; (2) work with Defense to resolve the use of $25.4&nbsp;million for equipment 
and services that were not provided during the period of performance for 13 task 
orders; (3) comply with Federal appropriation statutes and financial management 
regulations on obligating and expending funds, and (4) <span lang="EN">improve 
controls for documenting the task order award and oversight processes</span>.&nbsp; 
NIH concurred with our recommendations.</p>
