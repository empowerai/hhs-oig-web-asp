<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Beverly Healthcare of Reading was in compliance
  with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations for nursing homes.&nbsp; Based on our review of
  92 direct care employees, Beverly complied with Federal staffing laws and regulations, but did not
  comply with State staffing requirements.&nbsp; Beverly did not obtain a current Pennsylvania State
  Police background check for 4 direct care employees, did not obtain the background checks for 13 direct
  care employees within the required timeframes, and did not schedule sufficient staff to provide 2.7
  hours of direct care per resident per day for 7 of the days reviewed.&nbsp; We recommended that Beverly:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;restrict
  the four direct care employees from working directly with the residents until it obtains valid background
  checks; (2) review and strengthen its internal controls to assure that it obtains valid background
  checks on all new direct care employees, and prohibits new employees from working directly with the
  residents if the background checks are not received within the required timeframes; and (3) review
  and strengthen its internal controls to assure that it schedules direct care employees to ensure that
  there is enough nursing staff on duty to provide 2.7 hours of direct care per resident per day.&nbsp; Beverly
  concurred with our findings.</p>
