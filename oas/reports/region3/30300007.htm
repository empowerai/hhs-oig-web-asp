<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed Holy Cross Hospital (Holy Cross) for
  outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Holy Cross met Medicare’s requirements for (1) direct physician supervision
  and (2) providing “incident to” services.&nbsp; Specifically, Holy Cross contracted with two physicians to directly supervise
  the services provided by its cardiac rehabilitation program.. The physicians’ responsibilities included the daily supervision
  of the cardiac center, patients’ initial physical assessment, approval of cardiac rehabilitation treatment plans, and observation
  of patients’ daily progress.&nbsp; One of the physicians was always in the exercise area during regularly scheduled exercise
  sessions.&nbsp; In addition, from our specific claims review for a sample of 30 beneficiaries who received outpatient cardiac
  rehabilitation services during Calendar Year 2001, we determined that Holy Cross received Medicare payments of $7,470 for
  services where the diagnoses used to establish the patients’ eligibility for cardiac rehabilitation may not have been supported
  and for services not otherwise allowable.</p>
