<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This review points out that the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), Center for Quality Healthcare Services and Consumer
  Protection (the Center) utilized a reasonable methodology to allocate S&amp;C costs to the Medicare and Medicaid certification,
  and State licensing programs and correctly applied the Federally approved indirect costs rates for FYs 1997-1999.&nbsp; However,
  based on our examination and analysis of financial information, supporting documentation and other available evidence,
  we found that the Center: (1) claimed unallowable costs totaling $29,298 for the Medicare program in the first quarter
  of FY 1997 for the nurse aide program; (2) did not maintain adequate documentation to determine whether certain costs billed
  to VDH by the Virginia Department of Health Professions (DHP) for the nurse aide program were supportable, allowable, and
  accurate; and (3) did not obtain approval from CMS or the HHS Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) to implement a new cost
  allocation methodology for joint licensing and certification surveys conducted at long term care (LTC) facilities beginning
  in FY 2000.&nbsp; We recommended that the Center: (1) refund $29,298 to the Medicare program for unallowable costs charged
  in FY 1997; (2) establish a process for assuring that the quarterly charges to the Federal programs for the nurse aide
  program are supportable, allowable, and accurate; and (3) obtain final CMS/DCA approval for the new cost sharing methodology
  for joint licensing and certification surveys conducted at LTC facilities implemented in FY 2000. </p>
