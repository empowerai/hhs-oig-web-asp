<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether before declaring bankruptcy, the National
  Latina/o Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Organization (LLEGÓ) used Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC) grant funds in accordance with Federal guidelines for allowability.&nbsp; Our
  analysis of available documentation showed that LLEGÓ incurred $703,181 in unallowable costs:&nbsp; $379,022
  in unallowable expenses and $324,159 in expenses that occurred in a prior cooperative agreement
  period.&nbsp; This was contrary to Office of Management and Budget guidance, which states
  that Federal funds be used only for the purpose for which they were given.&nbsp; We recommended
  that CDC follow-up with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court as to the repayment of cooperative agreement
  funds from the LLEGÓ bankruptcy as allowed by 11 U.S.C. chapter 5.</p>
