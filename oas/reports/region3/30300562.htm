<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the Title IV-E administrative and training costs claimed by
  the Department of Services were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with applicable
  Federal regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; We found that the Department of Services used a revised allocation
  method that allocated all case management costs for candidates to Title IV-E, without considering the
  percentage actually placed in Title IV-E foster care.&nbsp; In addition, the Department of Services
  used incorrect salaries in flawed cost allocation schedules and claimed indirect costs at an enhanced
  funding rate.&nbsp; The Department of Services took actions during our audit to correct the conditions
  that we identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the Department of Services:&nbsp; (1) work with ACF officials to resolve the increase
  of $5,859,542 (Federal share) in Title IV-E administrative claims that resulted from using an inequitable
  methodology to allocate candidates’ case management costs, (2) amend its cost allocation plan to reflect
  the appropriate methodology for allocating administrative costs for foster care candidates, (3) continue
  to include only current-quarter salaries for the Client Payments Unit, the Training Unit, and Foster
  Home Coordinators in calculating administrative claims, (4) use actual salaries to recalculate the
  administrative claims for the quarters ended December 1999 through June 2001 and make the appropriate
  adjustments, and (5) refund to the Federal Government $53,191 in improperly claimed indirect costs
  and discontinue the practice of claiming indirect costs at the enhanced 75-percent Federal funding
  rate.</p>
