<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (State agency)
  properly recorded, summarized and reported bioterrorism preparedness transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions
  of the cooperative agreements and whether the State agency has established controls and procedures to monitor sub-recipient
  expenditures of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funds.&nbsp; We determined that the State agency generally
  accounted for Program funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement and applicable departmental
  regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; However, the State agency did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, or by
  priority area.&nbsp; The State agency had a reporting system to track and monitor sub-recipient activities.&nbsp; The State
  agency contracted with the Maryland Hospital Association, Inc. to assist in the disbursement of funds awarded by HRSA to
  Maryland for hospital sub-recipients.</p>
