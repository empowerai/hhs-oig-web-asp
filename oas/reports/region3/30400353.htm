<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded the District of Columbia
  Department of Health (District) $24.5 million between September 1999 and August 2004 to improve their
  bioterrorism preparedness and response capabilities under the Public Health Preparedness and Response
  for Bioterrorism Program (Program).&nbsp; Our objectives were to determine whether the District accounted
  for and used Program funds in accordance with the cooperative agreement with CDC, and did not supplant
  current State or local funding with Program funds.</p>
<p>The District did not track Program funds by focus area, and did not provide an accurate
  financial status report (FSR) for the period October 2001 to September 2003.&nbsp; The District did
  not use or did not obligate $11.8 million or 48 percent of the $24.5 million awarded.&nbsp; The District
  improperly charged or did not adequately document $76,432 in Program funds, and erroneously charged
  $162,105 in employee overtime pay to Program funds.&nbsp; The District did not use Program funds to
  supplant other State or local expenditures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We recommended that the District:&nbsp; (1) record, summarize, and report
  CDC Program funds awarded, expended, obligated, and unobligated by focus area in accordance with the
  cooperative agreement; (2) revise and resubmit the October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2003 FSR to CDC;
  (3) ensure Program activities are funded in a manner to minimize unobligated fund balances and to achieve
  Program goals; and (4) refund to CDC $238,537 representing $76,432 in improperly charged or inadequately
  documented costs, and $162,105 in erroneously charged overtime pay.&nbsp; The District concurred with
  our first three recommendations.&nbsp; We adjusted our fourth recommendation after the District provided
  documentation to support $66,301 in expenditures in response to our draft report.&nbsp; The District
  essentially met the intent of our fourth recommendation by agreeing to adjust its FSRs to account for
  the remaining $238,537 in improperly charged and inadequately documented expenditures.&nbsp; We are
  pleased that the District recognizes that $238,537 should not have been charged to Program funds.&nbsp; We
  are concerned that the revision of the FSRs only increases the significant unobligated funds already
  reported.</p>
