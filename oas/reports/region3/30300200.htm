<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania contracts with its counties to provide behavioral
    health services through the Medicaid managed care program, <i>HealthChoices</i>.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services (CMS) approved the <i>HealthChoices</i> program under a waiver granted under section 1915(b) of the Social Security
    Act and allows counties the right of first opportunity to provide behavioral health services without a competitive bid
    process.&nbsp; For the State fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, there were 15 counties in the program.&nbsp; The following
    year, the program expanded to 25 counties (of 67) and includes most of Pennsylvania’s major population centers.&nbsp; While
    aggregate profits were reasonable, we found that several counties realized profits that appeared unreasonable, some as
    high as 38 percent.&nbsp; We also found that Pennsylvania was not including these profits in its base year administrative
    costs as now required by CMS when submitting its rate requests.&nbsp; We recommended that CMS require the inclusion of
    county-specific profit and/or losses into its base year administrative costs to allow them to compare the proposed rates
to the base year data to assure that the rates are reasonable.</p>
