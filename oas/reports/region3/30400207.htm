<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This review was part of a multistate audit focusing on States’ accounts receivable systems for Medicaid
  provider overpayments.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether the State agency reported Medicaid
  provider overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human
  Resources did not report overpayments totaling $3,774,106 ($2,940,469 Federal share) to CMS because
  it was waiting to implement changes to its Medicaid Management Information System and did not report
  overpayments totaling $3,280,807 ($2477,041 Federal share) within the required timeframe because of
  an oversight and because it did not use the correct date of discovery.&nbsp; This nonreporting and
  untimely reporting also potentially resulted in approximately $20,000 in higher interest expense to
  the Federal Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend that the Department of Health and Human Resources: (1) include unreported overpayments
  totaling $3,744,106 on the CMS-64 and refund the $2,940,469 to the Federal Government, (2) determine
  the value of overpayments identified after our audit period that have not been reported and include
  them on the CMS-64, and (3) ensure that all future overpayments are reported within 60 days in accordance
  with Federal regulations, thereby mitigating the potentially higher interest expense to the Federal
  Government.</p>
