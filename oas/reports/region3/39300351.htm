<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that approximately 28 percent of Fiscal Year 1992 expenditures of AIDS grant funds by the
  Pennsylvania Department of Health were for grant administration. Due to this excessive amount, we are recommending that
  the Public Health Service (PHS) review AIDS grants awarded by all its components to determine the extent that AIDS funds
  are used for administrative purposes. We are also recommending that PHS develop a performance measure for AIDS grants based
  on the extent that AIDS funds are used for grant administration versus the provision of direct services. Finally, we are
  recommending that PHS establish criteria for evaluating grant applicants and administering grants using a fixed fee-for-service
  concept. </p>
