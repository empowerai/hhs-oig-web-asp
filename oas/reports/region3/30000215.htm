<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed by Prince William Annaburg Manor (PWAM), a Medicare skilled
  nursing facility, on the Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 Medicare cost report were in accordance with Medicare reimbursement requirements.
  Our audit disclosed that $1,582,079 or about 13 percent of the total claimed by PWAM were in violation of Medicare regulations.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Mutual of Omaha, the fiscal intermediary, adjust the FY 1998 Medicare cost report for the $1,582,079 improperly
  claimed, and insure that PWAM strengthens its procedures to preclude claiming unallowable cost.</p>
