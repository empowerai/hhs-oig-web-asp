<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="Default">We estimated that from October 1997 through September 2002, 
Pennsylvania improperly claimed at least $56.5 million of the total $562.3 
million (Federal share) claimed for Title IV-E reimbursement on behalf of 
Philadelphia County children for whom the per diem rates were $300 or less.&nbsp; 
Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as amended, authorizes States to claim 
Federal funding for maintenance costs through the Administration for Children 
and Families (ACF). &nbsp;The funding covers room and board payments to licensed 
foster care providers, administrative costs, and training.&nbsp; Some c<span style="font-size:
11.5pt">laims were unallowable because the services were provided to children 
whose situations did not meet eligibility requirements or provided by unlicensed 
foster care facilities.&nbsp; </span>We were unable to determine the allowability of 
other claims because the contractors’ per diem rates did not distinguish between 
services that were eligible or ineligible for Title IV-E reimbursement.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State refund $56.5 million and work with ACF to 
determine the allowability of $100 million related to claims that included both 
allowable and unallowable services; work with ACF to identify and resolve any 
unallowable claims made after the audit period and refund the appropriate 
amount;<a name="tm_1006638573"> </a>discontinue claiming Title IV-E 
reimbursement for ineligible children and services and unlicensed facilities; 
and direct Philadelphia County to develop rate-setting procedures that 
separately identify maintenance and other costs, including related 
administrative costs, so that claims are readily allocable to the appropriate 
Federal, State, and local funding sources. &nbsp;The State disagreed with our 
findings and recommendations and provided additional documentation on some 
claims.&nbsp; Based on this documentation, we revised the report accordingly.</p>
