<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For </font>
<font size="3">the period from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, we estimated 
that the State agency paid: $1,902,080 (Federal share $1,331,456) for Medicaid 
services provided to beneficiaries who should not have been eligible due to 
their Medicaid eligibility/residence in Maryland and $3,944,006 (Federal share 
$2,760,805) for Medicaid services provided to beneficiaries whose residence 
could not be determined from the information in the State agency’s and Maryland 
Medicaid agency’s case files.&nbsp; Both the District of 
Columbia and Maryland require that Medicaid beneficiaries be residents.&nbsp; </font></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">We recommended that the State 
agency work with the Maryland Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid 
eligibility information for use in: determining accurate beneficiary eligibility 
status, and<b> </b>reducing the amount of payments, estimated to be $1,902,080 
($1,331,456 Federal share), made on behalf of beneficiaries residing in 
Maryland.&nbsp; We also recommended that the State agency: determine the place of 
residence associated with beneficiaries who received services totaling 
$3,944,006 (Federal share $2,760,805), but whose residency could not be 
established, and verify addresses of all beneficiaries including those on 
Supplemental Security Income and children.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a letter the State agency 
advised us of actions it was taking to implement our recommendations.</font></span></h2>
