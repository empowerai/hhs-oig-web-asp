<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p>Our objective was to determine whether Maryland Department 
of Human Resources’s claims for Title IV-E administrative and training costs 
complied with its cost allocation plan.&nbsp; Maryland did not comply with its cost 
allocation plan.&nbsp; During the audit, Maryland amended its plan and made 
adjustments to refund about $3.2 million.&nbsp; We recommended that Maryland: refund 
$1,851,481 (Federal share) improperly claimed through unallowable cost centers, 
including two centers not identified in the plan and one center identified in 
the plan as dedicated 100 percent to State-only activities; and review claims 
made subsequent to our audit period to identify any additional claims made for 
these cost centers and make appropriate refunds.&nbsp; Maryland concurred.</p>
