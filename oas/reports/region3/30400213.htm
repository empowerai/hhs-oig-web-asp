<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Virginia improperly claimed, as Medicaid administrative costs, contingency
  fees paid to a consulting firm for Federal revenue maximization services. Between October 2001 and April 2003, Virginia
  claimed $677,964 in unallowable contingency fee payments made to a consulting firm for providing Federal revenue maximization
  services.&nbsp; The Federal share of these payments totaled $338,982.&nbsp; The consulting firm increased Federal revenues
  for Virginia by identifying expenditures eligible for 90 percent Federal financial participation.&nbsp; Virginia stated
  that it had improperly claimed these fees as Medicaid administrative costs and intended to submit the corrective adjustment.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Virginia refund $338,982 ($202,821 for Federal fiscal year 2002 and $136,161 for Federal fiscal year 2003)
  for the Federal share of improperly claimed contingency fees.&nbsp; Virginia concurred with our finding and recommendation.</p>
