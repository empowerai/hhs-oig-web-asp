<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHHS) had
  established adequate accountability and internal controls over rebate billings to drug manufacturers, the resulting rebate
  collections, and the resolution of disputes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Generally, DHHS had established adequate accountability and internal
  controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; However, we found that (1) DHHS personnel had not routinely backed-up
  spreadsheets that contained the state’s Medicaid drug rebate program information reported to CMS; and (2) DHHS overstated
  its outstanding rebate receivables, and had not reported rebates invoiced and adjustment on the CMS 64.9R.</p>
