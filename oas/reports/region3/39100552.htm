<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that the Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) internal controls were inadequate to safeguard
  Independent Living Program (ILP) funds from unauthorized expenditure and to prevent States from violating the spending
  cutoff dates established by legislation. Although there were several weaknesses noted, the most significant was the lack
  of a single control to prevent funding draws or expenditures after the spending cutoff dates. The controls appeared more
  oriented to the award amount, and permitted all transactions up to that amount, regardless of when the transactions occurred.
  We have concluded that ACF's inability to prevent State violations of the spending cutoff dates constitutes a significant
  program weakness in internal controls. The weaknesses in internal controls were a contributing factor to the States' failure
  to comply with the spending cutoff dates and Federal reporting requirements. As a result, $16.7 million of the $135 million
  of ILP funds awarded to States in Fiscal Years 1987 through 1989 was either spent or at risk of being spent after the spending
  cutoff dates. </p>
