<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The report is one of several reviews of procurements by PSC 
and other components of the Department in response to Hurricanes Katrina and 
Rita in 2005.<br>
<br>
The objective of the audit was to determine whether PSC complied with Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Health and Human Services Acquisition 
Regulation requirements during the award process involving MorganFranklin 
Corporation.&nbsp; PSC generally complied with the requirements.&nbsp; However, PSC did 
not execute a written determination and findings that no contract type other 
than a time-and-materials contract was suitable, as required by the FAR.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">OIG recommended that PSC 
execute a written determination and findings when awarding time-and-materials 
contracts.&nbsp; PSC agreed with the recommendation.</p>
