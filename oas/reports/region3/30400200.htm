<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether State in Region III had established adequate
  accountability and internal controls over their respective Medicaid drug rebate programs.&nbsp; We found that (1) four
  States (Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) had not reported accurate or complete information
  on reports to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services; (2) one state (Virginia) had not reconciled by National
  Drug Code drug rebates received with the invoices submitted; (3) one State (Pennsylvania) had not kept accurate records
  of outstanding disputed amounts for each manufacturer and another State (West Virginia) had not resolved disputes timely;
  and (4) one State (Pennsylvania) had not reviewed quarterly rebates received from drug manufacturers to determine if interest
  was owed when rebates were received after the due date, nor had it verified the accuracy of interest on disputes either
  due to or due from drug manufacturers.</p>
