<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine if the Department reported overpayments in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; We
  found that the Department did not report 10 overpayments totaling $169,068 ($85,430 Federal share) because provider appeals
  had not been finalized.&nbsp; When we brought these overpayments to the Department’s attention, it reported them on the
  CMS-64 for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.&nbsp; The Department did not report 95 overpayments totaling $3,226,166 ($1,630,182
  Federal share) within the required timeframe because it did not use the correct discovery date, and incorrectly reported
  a bankruptcy credit adjustment of $1,260,760 on Line 2 rather than Line 4 of supplemental schedule CMS-64.90.&nbsp; The
  inaccurate reporting resulted in CMS having incorrect Medicaid expenditure and overpayment data.&nbsp; This also potentially
  resulted in higher interest expense to the Federal government of approximately $9,500.&nbsp; The Department generally agreed
  with our report and has already taken steps to address our recommendations.</p>
