<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Virginia claimed family planning service costs under its Medicaid
  managed care program in accordance with its methodology and Federal statutes, regulations, and guidelines.&nbsp; Virginia
  did not claim family planning service costs in accordance with its methodology.&nbsp; Virginia included
  the following ineligible costs in the numerator of its family planning factor calculations:&nbsp; (1)
  family planning service costs for beneficiaries not eligible to enroll in managed care and not represented
  in the denominator; and (2) services that did not qualify as family planning.&nbsp; As a result, Virginia
  overstated its claims for family planning service costs by $3.7 million.&nbsp; By claiming these costs
  at the enhanced family planning rate of 90 percent, rather than its regular Federal share of about
  50 percent, Virginia received approximately $1.4 million in unallowable Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Virginia refund to the Federal Government $1,388,506 million in family planning service
  costs incorrectly claimed between April 2001 and March 2004.&nbsp; We also recommended that Virginia
  apply the audited factor of 1.43 percent for claims after March 2004 and refund the Federal share of
  any overpayments.&nbsp; Virginia concurred with both recommendations.</p>
