<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Maryland claimed family planning service
  costs under its Medicaid managed care program in accordance with its methodology and Federal statutes,
  regulations and guidelines. Maryland did not claim family planning service costs in accordance with
  its methodology.&nbsp; Maryland included ineligible costs in its family planning factor calculation.&nbsp; As
  a result, between July 2000 and March 2004, Maryland overstated its claims of family planning service
  costs by $2.9 million.&nbsp; By claiming these costs at the enhanced family planning rate of 90 percent,
  rather than its regular Federal share of 50 percent, Maryland received $228,643 in unallowable Federal
  reimbursement.&nbsp; We recommended that Maryland refund the Federal share of $228,643, and apply the
  audited family planning factor of 1.33 percent for claims after March 2004 and refund the Federal share
  of any overpayment.&nbsp; Maryland concurred with our recommendations.</p>
