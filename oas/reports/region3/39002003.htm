<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania claimed approximately $2.2 million in unallowable
  costs for administering the Medicare Part A program. The unallowable costs consisted of: rental costs of $1,159,389 which
  were claimed but not incurred; costs of $347,178 for unspecified projects that were not approved by the Health Care Financing
  Administration (HCFA); credits totaling $687,640 that were due but not used to offset Medicare costs; and $24,321 that
  was misclassified or based on estimated rather than actual costs. We recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements.
  Regional HCFA officials concurred with our findings and recommendations. </p>
