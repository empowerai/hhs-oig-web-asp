<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Aetna US Healthcare (AUSHC) contracts with the Federal Government to provide health benefits to Medicare
  beneficiaries.&nbsp; The Federal Government pays AUSHC a per-member-per-month rate for each enrolled Medicare beneficiary.&nbsp; AUSHC
  receives an enhanced rate for those beneficiaries who reside in facilities designated as institutions and who meet a qualifying
  30-day residency period. Between January 1, 1996 and September 30, 1998, AUSHC incorrectly identified 12 beneficiaries
  in institutional status.&nbsp; Six did not meet the 30-day residency requirement, while six resided in facilities that
  were not defined as institutions.&nbsp; We recommended that AUHSC refund $113,993 in overpayments resulting from this misclassification.&nbsp; This
  included $5,338 that represented overpayments received after September 30, 1998 for two beneficiaries that continued to
  be erroneously identified as institutionalized.&nbsp; We also recommended that AUSHC strengthen their internal controls
  to prevent these errors from occurring.</p>
