<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>During the period October 1, 1996 through September 30, 2002 the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Social Services
  (DSS) recovered $3,431,869 in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayments and was required to refund federal
  financial participation of $1,762,951.&nbsp; We confirmed that DSS refunded $541,457 in accordance with federal requirements
  and did not remit $769,092 to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF).&nbsp; We
  found that four additional refunds totaling $452,402 that the DSS attempted to make were never recorded by ACF because
  the refund form was inadvertently included by DSS as part of a statistical package and was not processed by ACF.&nbsp; We
  recommend that DSS:&nbsp; (1) refund the un-remitted federal share of $769,092 to ACF, (2)&nbsp;notify ACF of the attempted
  refunds totaling $452,402 that were never recorded and resubmit, if necessary, amended documentation as directed by ACF,
  and (3)&nbsp;continue to refund quarterly collected AFDC overpayments as required by federal regulations.</p>
