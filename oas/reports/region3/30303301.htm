<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether James Bell Associates, Inc. (JBA) costs claimed
  from September 1, 2000 to August 31, 2001 were allowable, allocable, and reasonable under the terms of the grant and applicable
  Federal regulations.&nbsp; We identified $174,724 in questionable costs and $28,547 that we set aside for adjudication
  by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).&nbsp; We recommended that SAMHSA ensure JBA
  develop and implement accounting policies and procedures to ensure adherence to applicable Federal regulations and Public
  Health Service Grants Policy requirements; refund to SAMHSA $174,724 in costs that were not allowable; and provide additional
  documentation to SAMHSA for $28,547 in costs that were unresolved; or refund to SAMHSA those unresolved costs for which
  no additional documentation is available.</p>
