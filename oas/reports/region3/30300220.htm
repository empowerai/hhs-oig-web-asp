<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Delaware Health and Social Services (Delaware) claimed
  family planning service costs under its Medicaid managed care program in accordance with
  its CMS-approved methodology and Federal statutes, regulations, and guidelines.&nbsp; We
  could not validate Delaware’s family planning service rates, which were based on fee-for-service
  claims incurred between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1994, because Delaware did not provide
  documentation to support its calculations.&nbsp; Because Delaware could not justify its calculation
  of family planning service costs, it was not entitled to the $2.9 million enhanced Federal
  share.</p>
<p>We recommended that Delaware (1) provide support for family planning service costs claimed
  between October 2000 and June 2004 or refund $2,916,288 to the Federal Government and (2)
  work with CMS to determine the amounts claimed for family planning service costs after June
  2004, refund the enhanced portion to the Federal Government, and discontinue claiming family
  planning service costs at the enhanced rate until it provides adequate support for its family
  planning rates.&nbsp; In comments, Delaware did not agree that was required to refund enhanced
  reimbursement, based on its belief that CMS had previously approved supporting documentation.</p>
