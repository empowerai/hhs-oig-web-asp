<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This review was part of a multistate audit. Our objective was to determine whether the District of
  Columbia (District) reported Medicaid provider overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; The
  District did not report all overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements during our October
  1, 2001, through September 30, 2002, audit period.&nbsp; Specifically, the District did not report
  overpayments totaling $3,999,211 ($2,195,049 Federal share) to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
  Services (CMS) because the overpayments had not been collected due to appeals from the providers and&nbsp; did
  not report overpayments totaling $16,172,361 ($9,168,584 Federal share) within the required timeframe
  because the District reimbursed CMS only after collecting overpayments from providers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the District:&nbsp; (1) include unreported overpayments totaling $3,999,211 on
  the Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program, Form CMS-64 (CMS-64),
  and refund the $2,195,049 Federal share; (2) determine the value of overpayments identified after our
  audit period that have not been reported and include them on the CMS-64; (3) establish a policy consistent
  with Federal reporting requirements that accurately reports overpayments on the CMS-64; and (4) ensure
  that all future overpayments are reported within 60 days in accordance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; In
  response to our draft report, the District concurred with the results of our audit and said that it
  was in the process of reporting the identified overpayments.&nbsp; The District did not address our
  recommendation to determine the value of overpayments identified after our audit period that have not
  been reported.</p>
