<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our review of general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs included in the
  Fiscal Year (FY) 1991 Medicare cost report submitted by the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
  The audit was part of a nationwide review performed at the request of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
  of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives. The review disclosed $207,933 in costs improperly allocated
  to Medicare. These costs were unallowable primarily because the costs were not related to patient care. We recommended
  that MCP remove these costs from its FY 1991 cost report and implement controls to prevent the inclusion of these costs
  in the future. </p>
