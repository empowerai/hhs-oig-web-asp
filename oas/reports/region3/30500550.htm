<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (the State 
agency) did not always claim Title IV-E maintenance and associated 
administrative costs for Philadelphia County’s Castille program in accordance 
with Federal requirements.&nbsp; Based on the sample results, we estimated that the 
State agency improperly claimed $7,090,323 in Title IV-E maintenance costs.&nbsp; 
Including associated administrative costs of $4,521,499, we estimated that the 
State agency improperly claimed at least $11,611,822 of the total $28,424,124 
(Federal share) claimed for Title IV-E reimbursement on behalf of the Castille 
program.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government 
$11,611,822 in unallowable costs for the period October 1997 through September 
2002, (2) work with ACF to determine the allowability of the remaining 
$16,812,302 claimed, (3) work with the Administration for Children and Families 
(ACF) to identify and resolve any unallowable 
Castille program claims made after September 2002 and refund the appropriate 
amount, and (4) discontinue claiming Title IV-E reimbursement for ineligible 
services and children.&nbsp; The State agency disagreed with the recommendations.</p>
