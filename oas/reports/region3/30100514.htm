<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>From October 1, 1997 to September 30, 2000, the Immigration and Refugee Services of America (IRSA) received $1,199,707
  in grant funding from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to place refugees into ACF approved communities. &nbsp;The
  objectives of our review were to determine if IRSA: achieved the grant objectives, complied with grant terms and conditions,
  and was capable of managing Federal funds. In general, IRSA accomplished the grant objectives.&nbsp; However, IRSA placed
  266 refugees into 2 communities that were not approved by ACF at the time of initial placement.&nbsp; The IRSA stated that
  ACF gave prior verbal approval of these sites.</p>
