<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>From May 1999 through April 2000, the Immigration and Refugee Services of America (IRSA) received $1,165,927 in Federal
  funds from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) for the Kosovo Refugee Emergency Assistance Grant Program
  to assist refugees in applying for asylum in the U.S.&nbsp; We found that IRSA accomplished all grant objectives and, in
  general, complied with the standard terms and conditions of the grant and was capable of managing Federal funds.&nbsp; However,
  we also determined that IRSA had internal control weaknesses that required correction, resulting in IRSA overcharging ACF
  $10,913, relying on some verbal accounting policies and maintaining uninsured bank deposits.&nbsp; The IRSA generally concurred
  with our recommendations and agreed to refund $10,913 in overcharges.&nbsp; However, IRSA officials stated that their management
  or auditors do not anticipate any loss from the uninsured bank deposits.&nbsp; We recommended that IRSA recognize and handle
  uninsured bank deposits appropriately.</p>
