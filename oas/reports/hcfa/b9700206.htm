<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Audits of the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) financial statements 
  estimated that the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program improperly paid providers 
  $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 and $20.3 billion in FY 1997. Therefore, 
  the capitation rate setting methodology for managed care organizations (MCO) 
  is flawed because the methodology is based in part on Medicare's FFS system 
  with capitation rates for MCOs set at 95 percent of the average cost of treating 
  the beneficiary in Medicare's FFS program. As such, 95 percent of improper FFS 
  payments are included when MCO capitation rates are calculated. Unless these 
  improper payments are removed from MCO rate calculations, they will continue 
  to result in the equivalent of an overpayment in the Medicare managed care program 
  at taxpayers' expense. We recommended that HCFA pursue legislation that will 
  allow modifications to MCO capitation rates which would include an adjustment 
  for the estimated amounts of unrecovered improper payments that are included 
  in MCO rate calculations. </p>
