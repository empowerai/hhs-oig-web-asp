<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our analysis, made at the request 
  of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), of Medicare claims in which 
  a beneficiary was discharged and subsequently readmitted on the same day to 
  the same hospital during Calendar Years 1996 and 1997. The review disclosed 
  over 34,500 readmissions nationwide in these 2 years with payments totaling 
  about $226.6 million for the second hospital stays. Based on certain trends 
  and patterns among providers, beneficiaries, and diagnostic related groups (DRG), 
  we found same day readmissions are a cause of concern regarding quality of care 
  issues in addition to billing and overpayment problems. We recommended that 
  HCFA: (1) make the data in our report available to peer review organizations 
  for use in determining the scope of their peer review activities; (2) perform 
  reviews at hospitals having a larger than average number of same day readmissions; 
  (3) perform beneficiary-specific reviews on the claims of beneficiaries who 
  had multiple continuous same day readmissions; and (4) review a sample of same 
  day readmission claims in which the same day readmission was coded with the 
  same DRG as the first hospital stay. The HCFA generally concurred with our recommendations.
