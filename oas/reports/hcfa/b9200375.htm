<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>In a prior report the General Accounting Office (GAO) made six recommendations 
  to improve identification of other forms of insurance that should pay for Medicare 
  beneficiaries' medical services before Medicare. Our follow-up review found 
  that HHS has taken appropriate action on five of the recommendations with which 
  it had agreed. Specifically, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA): 
  increased Medicare secondary payer (MSP) savings goals for intermediaries and 
  has increased the Contractor Performance Evaluation Program standards for MSP 
  performance; established the MSP outreach program to improve hospital performance 
  in primary payer billings; revised the Hospital Manual to require hospitals 
  to obtain complete information on beneficiaries' other insurance sources; revised 
  the regulations to extend the MSP provision of the law to all forms of no-fault 
  insurance coverage; and resubmitted its earlier legislative proposal to require 
  primary payers to notify HCFA about individuals who are enrolled in insurance 
  programs to which Medicare is a secondary payer and to notify the Secretary 
  about pending claims from Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
