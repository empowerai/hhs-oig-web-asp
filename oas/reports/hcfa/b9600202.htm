<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Medicare payments to excluded 
  and unlicensed health care providers. The objective of our review was to determine 
  if the Medicare program inappropriately reimbursed individuals or entities who 
  were excluded from the program or whose license was suspended or revoked by 
  a State licensing board. Our review was limited to individuals and entities 
  with a Maryland address at the time of exclusion and individuals whose license 
  was suspended or revoked by the Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance. 
</p>
<p>We found: 
<ul>
  <li>the Medicare program has reimbursed 22 percent (6 out of 27) of the excluded 
    individuals for whom we were able to locate a unique physician/practitioner 
    identification number (UPIN) during their period of exclusion;<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>the Medicare program has reimbursed 15 percent (6 out of 40) of the individuals 
    who had known UPINs with practice locations in the State of Maryland for services 
    provided while they were unlicensed in the State of Maryland;<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>individuals who have had their Maryland license suspended or revoked have 
    relocated to other States and can continue to treat Medicare beneficiaries 
    in the States they relocated to;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>current data bases which contain exclusion and adverse licensure actions 
    are incomplete and inaccessible; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>a single consolidated source is needed which contains information on all 
    adverse actions taken against health care providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although nationally the percentage of aberrant health care providers (those 
  excluded or with a suspended/revoked license) is small, they can endanger the 
  lives of beneficiaries and should not be allowed to further abuse our health 
  care system. We recommend that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA): 
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that Medicare contractors have established adequate controls to preclude 
    payments to excluded and unlicensed health care providers; expand our data 
    match nationally to identify payments made to excluded providers; and recover 
    the payments identified in our review and subsequent data matches from the 
    excluded and unlicensed providers.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Confirm that its contractors get licensing data from the appropriate State 
    agencies and that Medicare payments are terminated to unlicensed individuals.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Institute edits in its present and future payment systems to prevent payment 
    to excluded and unlicensed providers.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Take into consideration our findings as it continues development of the 
    National Provider System (NPS) and continue to support legislative proposals 
    to create a comprehensive data base that would capture negative actions on 
    all health care providers and would be accessible by all interested parties.<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>Work with the Public Health Service (PHS) to implement section 1921 of the 
    Social Security Act which would require States to provide information to the 
    Secretary regarding specified actions (such as revocation or suspension of 
    a license) taken by the State entity responsible for the licensing of health 
    care providers. The Secretary is authorized to provide this information to 
    Federal agencies administering health care programs, State licensing authorities, 
    State Medicaid agencies, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, law enforcement 
    agencies, and other specified entities. It will be necessary to coordinate 
    this with the implementation of the new adverse action data base created by 
    Public Law 104-191.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to our draft report, HCFA concurred with all of the recommendations.
