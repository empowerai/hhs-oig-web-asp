<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our review of contracted advisory 
  and assistance services (AAS) as required by Section 1114(b) of Title 31 of 
  the United States Code. Our review disclosed that the Health Care Financing 
  Administration did not report at least $2.3 million in AAS acquisitions to the 
  Department and the Federal Procurement Data System. These inaccuracies were 
  due to the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes an AAS obligation 
  which causes the operational components to apply their own interpretation of 
  the Executive Office of Management and Budget Circular A-120 criteria. </p>
