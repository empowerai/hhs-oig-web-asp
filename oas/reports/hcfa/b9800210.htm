<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that administrative costs claimed by 232 risk-based 
  managed care organizations (MCO) on their adjusted community rate (ACR) proposals 
  for each of the years 1996 through 1999 contained significant disparities among 
  plans. For example, for 1999 the average amount allocated by an MCO for administration 
  ranged from a high of 32 percent to a low of 3 percent. These disparities were 
  noted in every year of our review regardless of plan model (group, individual 
  practice association, or staff) or tax status (profit or nonprofit). Unlike 
  other areas of the Medicare program, a reasonable percentage or ceiling for 
  an administrative cost rate is not required by the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA). We recommended that HCFA institute a ceiling on the amount of administrative 
  costs that MCOs can claim on ACR proposals. For example, had a 15 percent ceiling 
  been in effect for 1998, an additional $1 billion may have been passed on to 
  Medicare beneficiaries in the form of additional benefits or reduced payments 
  (e.g., deductibles and/or co-insurance). The HCFA agreed that a more thorough 
  analysis of ACR proposals should be performed, but did not concur with our recommendation 
  of setting a ceiling on administrative costs, claiming that a ceiling may discourage 
  plans from developing cost efficient plans. </p>
