<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that improvements are still needed in the Health 
  Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) system for classifying beneficiaries 
  enrolled in certain high cost categories such as end stage renal disease (ESRD). 
  A limited review of 76 beneficiaries classified as ESRD disclosed that 14 beneficiaries 
  (18 percent) were misclassified during 1997 resulting in $112,486 in gross payment 
  errors. We found that 9 beneficiaries' ESRD status was terminated prematurely 
  resulting in underpayments of $57,497, and 5 beneficiaries had no signs of renal 
  failure resulting in overpayments of $54,989 to the MCO. We recommended that 
  HCFA made procedural and systems changes to prevent further erroneous classifications 
  of ESRD status and instruct all ESRD centers to verify the status of beneficiaries 
  and to submit census data on a timely basis. The HCFA concurred with our findings 
  and recommendations. </p>
