<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report is our follow-up audit of the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
  report entitled, &quot;Medicare - Reasonableness of Health Maintenance Organization 
  Payments Not Assured&quot; (GAO/HRD-89-41). The objective of our follow-up review 
  was to ensure that the specific audit recommendations unconditionally accepted 
  by the Health Care Financing Administration were satisfactorily implemented 
  or appropriately resolved. Our review showed that the Department of Health and 
  Human Services (HHS) either has implemented or is implementing six of the seven 
  GAO recommendations. The remaining recommendation concerning placing a health 
  maintenance organization under a corrective action plan if it used inappropriate 
  data in preparing its adjusted community rate proposal was not accepted by HHS.
