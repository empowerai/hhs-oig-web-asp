<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 modified the methodology used to determine 
  managed care organization (MCO) payments, partly because of concerns that many 
  MCOs were overcompensated. Many MCO industry representatives now claim that 
  the payment changes brought about by BBA were too severe. However, our final 
  report points out that numerous reviews by the Office of Inspector General show 
  otherwise. Among other things, our reviews showed; (1) the basis on which the 
  monthly capitation payment amounts were calculated were flawed, (2) Medicare 
  payments were being used to fund unnecessary administrative costs and excess 
  profits, (3) investment income was not accounted for by MCOs in the Medicare 
  payment formula, and (4) improper payments were made to MCOs for erroneously 
  classified beneficiaries. The cumulative impact of these issues is that MCOs 
  receive more than an adequate amount of funds to deliver the Medicare package 
  of covered services, i.e., those services received by 85 percent of Medicare 
  beneficiaries (those in the Medicare fee-for-service program). Therefore, we 
  recommended that HCFA consider all the financial related work we have completed 
  recently and use these studies and reviews to modify the present monthly rates 
  to a level fully supported by empirical data. The HCFA agreed with our overall 
  finding that MCO payments are adequate to fund the Medicare package of covered 
  services. </p>
