<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our review of the Health Care Financing 
  Administration's (HCFA) implementation of the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity 
  Act (FMFIA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1991. As a result of our review, nothing came 
  to our attention that would cause us to believe that HCFA was not in general 
  compliance with FMFIA. Although HCFA has made significant efforts in developing 
  its FMFIA program, we identified areas which warrant management's attention. 
  We believe that HCFA should: (1) review all financial management systems that 
  provide data to the accounting system in accordance with Section 4, (2) consider 
  reclassifying the risk assessments of internal control areas that are pending 
  material weaknesses and high risk areas, and (3) enhance the testing used to 
  evaluate the Medicare contractors' internal control activities. </p>
