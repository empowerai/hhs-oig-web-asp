<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that proposed payment rates established for diabetes 
  self-management training (DSMT) for both individual and group sessions are inflated 
  because the proposed rates include calculation errors. In addition, it appears 
  the group session payment rate is substantially higher than that being charged 
  in the marketplace. As a result, Medicare could make improper payments for DSMT 
  training totaling $50 million for Fiscal Years 2000 through 2003. Also, Medicare 
  beneficiaries could be adversely affected by the inflated payment rates in the 
  amount of $12.5 million for co-payments during the same period. We recommended 
  that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) further review the rates 
  contained in the proposed rule. At a minimum, the rates should be adjusted downward 
  to correct the calculation errors noted by our review. We plan to expand our 
  work in this area into a national study of the training services being rendered. 
  If HCFA finalizes the proposed rates before our work is completed, then we suggest 
  that HCFA acknowledge in the final rule that the Office of Inspector General 
  is performing additional work and the rates may be modified at a later date.
