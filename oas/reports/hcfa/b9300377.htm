<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report represents the results of a joint review by the Offices of 
  Inspectors General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department 
  of Defense (DOD) required by the Defense Authorization Act (DAA) of 1993 to 
  review and determine the amount of incorrect Medicare payments made to the Uniformed 
  Services Treatment Facilities (USTF) during the period October 1, 1986 through 
  December 31, 1989. The DAA also required that, as part of this joint review, 
  we address possible procedures to avoid future billing inaccuracies. The DOD 
  estimated that only $7.1 million in Medicare Part A benefit payments was for 
  covered USTF services. We jointly determined, however, that DOD owes the Health 
  Care Financing Administration about $7.8 million and have recommended a financial 
  adjustment based on this amount. We also recommended procedural improvements 
  to preclude billing inaccuracies and problems in the future. </p>
