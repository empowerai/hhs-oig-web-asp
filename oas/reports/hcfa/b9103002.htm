<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of the Health Care Financing 
  Administration's (HCFA) Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Loan and Loan 
  Guarantee Fund for Fiscal Year 1991. The objective of our review was to determine 
  whether the HMO loan fund financial transactions were accurately recorded and 
  reported. We also reviewed internal control policies and procedures for recording 
  and documenting payments, monitoring HMO loans, and writing off delinquent HMO 
  loans. We found that internal controls need improvement to ensure that all HMO 
  loan payments and liabilities are accurately and properly reported and that 
  written procedures are established to document the HCFA deviations from Department 
  of the Treasury reporting. We also found that internal controls need improvement 
  to ensure that the general ledger balance for loans payable is reconciled to 
  the Office of Prepaid Health Care's supporting records. </p>
