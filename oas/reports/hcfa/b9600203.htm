<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our continuing review of Medicare payments 
  made to risk-based health maintenance organizations (HMO) on behalf of beneficiaries 
  classified as having end stage renal disease (ESRD). </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to continue and update our prior work (see 
  our report, &quot;<em>Review of Medicare Payments to Health Maintenance Organizations 
  for End Stage Renal Disease Beneficiaries</em>&quot; (A-04-94-01090)) to determine 
  the appropriateness of payments made to HMOs on behalf of ESRD-classified beneficiaries. 
  Our prior review found that the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) 
  systems did not recognize ESRD eligibility termination dates for beneficiaries 
  enrolled in HMOs. The scope of the prior review included those beneficiaries 
  who did not meet HCFA rules of HMO enrollment as an ESRD-eligible person. This 
  review examines eligibility and payment issues on behalf of those beneficiaries 
  who were not included in our prior review. </p>
<p>We found that HCFA's systems have been improved and now maintain a more complete 
  history of ESRD information and, effective October 1996, HCFA implemented systems 
  changes to adjust payments to HMOs when a beneficiary's ESRD entitlement ends. 
  Although several recalculations were necessary to properly identify beneficiaries' 
  correct periods of ESRD eligibility resulting in a mistaken $100 million in 
  overpayments being issued in October 1996, we commend HCFA for its efforts in 
  updating data in its systems for the ESRD beneficiary population and implementing 
  software modifications to recognize ESRD end dates for HMO payment adjustments 
  and enrollment decisions. These systems enhancements will prevent approximately 
  $15 million a year in future overpayments. </p>
<p>However, we also found that HCFA is unnecessarily limiting the time period 
  for recovery of the overpayments from HMOs made on behalf of beneficiaries whose 
  ESRD entitlement had ended. We identified $20.5 million in overpayments which 
  HCFA does not plan to collect because of the time limits it is imposing on its 
  recovery efforts. These overpayments were made to HMOs between January 1992 
  and February 1995 on behalf of beneficiaries who, according to HCFA's records, 
  no longer meet the statutory definition for ESRD entitlement because they had 
  a successful kidney transplant or are no longer dialyzing. The $20.5 million 
  in overpayments is in addition to the overpayments identified in our prior report. 
  We noted that the law, regulations, and the HCFA HMO manual are silent regarding 
  a statute of limitations to recover overpayments from risk-based HMOs. </p>
<p>We are recommending that HCFA recover all overpayments that have occurred at 
  least since 1992 as a result of the system not recognizing ESRD termination 
  dates for beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs and issue regulations to clearly specify 
  time limits for the recovery of overpayments from HMOs. Also, aggressive management 
  action should be taken to curtail payments whenever it is known or anticipated 
  that a major overpayment may occur, such as the overpayment that occurred in 
  October 1996. </p>
<p>In response to our draft report, HCFA disagreed with our recommendation to 
  recover all overpayments that occurred at least since 1992, but agreed with 
  our other recommendations. </p>
<p>We continue to believe that HCFA should recover overpayments at least since 
  1992. This situation is especially disconcerting to us since 71 HMOs received 
  this $20.5 million in a highly enhanced payment rate to provide a special type 
  of service which they did not provide. We are unable to determine HCFA's justification 
  for limiting the time period for recovery of overpayments, while setting no 
  time limitations on paying underpayments to the HMOs. We also still have concerns 
  about the separate recovery schedules HCFA established for overpayment recoveries 
  and the resulting distinction and apparent disparity in treatment between beneficiaries 
  who lost ESRD status while enrolled in a plan and those who lost ESRD status 
  before enrollment in a plan. Prior to HCFA's systems enhancements implemented 
  in August 1996, the systems were not able to calculate end dates, however, the 
  systems can now calculate end dates. We note that HCFA's systems do have information 
  which would allow retroactive adjustments at least to 1992--we used this information 
  to identify the misclassified beneficiaries in our review and to calculate the 
  overpayments. </p>
