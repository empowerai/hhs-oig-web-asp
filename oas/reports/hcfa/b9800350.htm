<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is currently developing a prospective 
  payment system (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities. This system is to be implemented 
  for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998. We have reviewed 
  HCFA's methodology for developing the new system and believe it will result 
  in PPS rates that are inflated. The HCFA did not adjust base year costs (Fiscal 
  Year 1995) for medically unnecessary care and/or the amount of improper payments 
  that were made to skilled nursing facilities. If improper payments are not eliminated 
  from the base period costs, unwarranted financial windfalls will be realized 
  by skilled nursing providers. Consequently, we are recommending that HCFA include 
  a provision in the interim final rule that indicates these proposed rates will 
  be further reviewed and adjusted downward to reflect the amount of improper 
  payments in the base year costs. </p>
