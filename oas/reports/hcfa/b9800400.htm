<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) plans to implement a prospective 
  payment system (PPS) for outpatient department (OPD) services in the Year 2000. 
  We reviewed HCFA's methodology for establishing fee schedules under the new 
  system and concluded HCFA's methodology will cause the fee schedules to be inflated. 
  The HCFA's methodology does not adequately adjusts for factors such as unallowable 
  costs and improper payments which were included in the base period when calculating 
  the fee schedule amounts and targeted expenditure ceiling. Hospitals will realize 
  windfall profits at Medicare's expense if these factors are not taken into account. 
  Also, OPD reimbursements are inflated in comparison to amounts paid for similar 
  services performed in other settings, such as ambulatory surgical centers and 
  physicians' offices. We are recommending that other studies be made to assess 
  the extent to which unallowable costs and improper payments were included in 
  base period costs, and that appropriate adjustments be made to the fee schedules 
  and expenditure ceiling. We are also recommending that HCFA carefully consider 
  the potential efficiencies demonstrated in various service settings when establishing 
  uniform payment rates. The HCFA concurred with our recommendations. </p>
