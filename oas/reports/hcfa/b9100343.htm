<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) audits 
  of peer review organizations (PRO) bid proposals completed during Fiscal Year 
  1990 resulted in a savings to the Medicare program of over $33 million. This 
  represents a return of $83 to $1 when compared with the cost of performing these 
  audits. However, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) did not have 
  a comprehensive program to reduce the occurrences of unsupported costs in future 
  PRO bid proposals. Further, HCFA had not taken action to ensure that PROs take 
  appropriate actions in response to procedural recommendations made in the OIG's 
  PRO proposal audits. </p>
