<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out the results of our review of the Health 
  Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) implementation of the Federal Managers' 
  Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) for Fiscal Year 1993. We found that the HCFA 
  continues to make progress in improving the FMFIA process and establishing effective 
  controls. However, improvements are needed. We recommended that HCFA modify 
  its plan that covers the Medicare contractors' management controls and financial 
  management systems to ensure that it has adequate coverage of the contractors 
  under the FMFIA. We also recommended that HCFA review the functions of the Office 
  of the Actuary, reclassify all management control areas with pending material 
  weaknesses of Office of Management and Budget high-risk designation as a high 
  risk, expand financial management system reviews, reestablish the cost allocation 
  system material weakness until all components have properly implemented the 
  system, perform corrective action reviews on all corrected material weaknesses, 
  and reevaluate the corrective action plan for the Medicare secondary payer high-risk 
  area. </p>
