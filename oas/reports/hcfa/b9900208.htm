<P>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</P>
</STRONG> 
<P>This Department of Defense (DOD) OIG review, with assistance from the HHS OIG, 
  was made as part of the HHS OIG's partnership initiatives to expand audit coverage 
  of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The DOD OIG's report points out that 
  military treatment facilities provided inpatient treatment to dual eligible 
  beneficiaries who were also enrolled in Medicare's risk-based health maintenance 
  organizations (HMO). As a result, the DOD expended about $45.2 million in Fiscal 
  Year 1997 for inpatient care for DOD dual eligible beneficiaries on whose behalf 
  the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) made per capita payments to 
  HMOs. The DOD OIG recommended that DOD consult with HHS and the Office of Management 
  and Budget to develop a strategy, including potential legislative action, to 
  reduce or eliminate overlapping expenditures for DOD beneficiaries, age 65 and 
  older, who are enrolled in HMO plans and provided access to military treatment 
  facilities. We fully support the DOD OIG recommendation and encourage HCFA to 
  work with DOD to eliminate these duplicate expenditures of Federal funds. </P>
