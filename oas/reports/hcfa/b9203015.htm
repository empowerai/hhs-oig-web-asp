<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that the Health Care Financing Administration 
  (HCFA) has made improvements to its financial reporting by incorporating accrual 
  financial data into its general ledger. However, HCFA's financial management 
  systems still do not adequately support the amounts contained in Medicare financial 
  reports. Recommendations call for improvements that will allow HCFA's financial 
  management systems to meet the requirements of the Chief Financial Officers 
  Act of 1990 and Office of Management and Budget requirements. </p>
