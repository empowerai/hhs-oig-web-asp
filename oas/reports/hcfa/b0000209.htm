<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Presently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability 
  of costs in the adjusted community rate (ACR) process, unlike other areas of 
  the Medicare program.&nbsp; Our review showed that if cost principles applicable 
  to Medicare's fee-for-service program were applied to Medicare+Choice organizations, 
  $37,649 of the Plan's administrative costs should not have been included when 
  computing the ACRs. &nbsp; These administrative costs included donations, gifts, 
  political contributions, memberships, sponsorships, entertainment, parties, 
  alcoholic beverages, broker commissions, and promotional giveaways.&nbsp; Because 
  of a lack of criteria for inclusion of administrative costs on the ACR proposal, 
  there are no recommendations addressed to the Plan.&nbsp; Instead, based on 
  the results of our nationwide review, we will be making recommendations to CMS 
  concerning the ACR process.</p>
