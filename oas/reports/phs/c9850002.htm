<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of cost increases related 
  to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) construction of the Arkansas Regional 
  Laboratory (ARL). The current ARL estimate is $37.9 million, which is $10.4 
  million, or 38 percent, higher than the original estimate of $27.5 million. 
  The review was requested by the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
  FDA and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations. </p>
<p>We determined that ARL project's cost exceeded the budget estimate by $10.4 
  million as a result of the following: (1) $3.4 million in costs not included 
  in the estimate FDA used as a basis for the budget request, (2) $2.1 million 
  due to the architecture and engineering (A&amp;E) firm revising its estimate 
  upward in October of 1996, and (3) $4.9 million in additional costs attributable 
  to a combination of factors including: inflation, the A&amp;E firm's unfamiliarity 
  with the Arkansas area, the effects of a &quot;building boom&quot; in Arkansas, 
  the A&amp;E firm's cursory assessment of market conditions, and the inexact 
  nature of construction estimates. </p>
<p>We also identified several management control weaknesses in FDA's oversight 
  of this project, which may have contributed to the agency's underestimating 
  ARL's project costs. Specifically, FDA did not: establish centralized control 
  over the fiscal management of the project at the start of the project; maintain 
  a sound project tracking system, or obtain a second estimate. Furthermore, the 
  estimate obtained by FDA only included the cost of the construction contract, 
  not total projected costs, which may also include items such as construction 
  quality management fees, architect and engineering fees, telecommunications, 
  and construction contingency. We also noted that FDA does not have adequate 
  written policies for budgeting construction projects. </p>
<p>To ensure that the ARL and future FDA construction projects are implemented 
  with anticipated cost ranges, we recommended that the FDA: (1) establish clear 
  lines of responsibility for future construction projects by assigning responsibility 
  for planning, budget development, and execution of the project to one high-level 
  official within the Office of Management and Systems, (2) implement a system 
  for tracking estimated project costs throughout the budget development stage, 
  (3) institute a policy to closely review budgets and estimates to ensure completeness 
  and accuracy, and (4) institute general policies regarding developing a construction 
  project budget. </p>
