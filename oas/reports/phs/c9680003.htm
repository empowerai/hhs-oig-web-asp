<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of the Office of Inspector General's review 
  of internal controls over, and use of purchase cards by the National Institutes 
  of Health (NIH). </p>
<p>The objective of the review was to determine whether NIH has designed and implemented 
  adequate internal controls over its purchase card activities. </p>
<p>Generally, NIH has designed and implemented adequate management controls over 
  the use of purchase cards. The General Services Administration (GSA) provided 
  general guidance to agencies for using purchase cards. We found NIH to be in 
  compliance with the GSA guidance. Our findings agreed with those of Enterprise 
  Integration Services, an NIH contractor, which issued a June 1996 report concluding 
  that NIH was in compliance with all applicable GSA guidance. </p>
<p>However, NIH may not be in compliance with General Accounting Office (GAO) 
  internal control standard relating to separation of duties. Individual cardholders 
  were authorized to both order and sign for receipt of goods and services. Internal 
  control standards issued by GAO specify that key duties, such as authorizing, 
  approving, and recording transactions; and issuing and receiving assets should 
  be separated among individuals. The NIH officials identified several compensating 
  controls that they believe adequately make up for the apparent lack of separation 
  of key duties and responsibilities; however, they told us that they did not 
  formally assess the risks in this area. </p>
<p>In addition, NIH cardholders did not always comply with NIH policy and procedures 
  relating to payment of sales taxes. Six of the 25 cardholders whose transactions 
  we reviewed improperly paid State sales tax on eight transactions in June and 
  July 1996. The NIH officials advised us that they would obtain refunds from 
  the vendors in the eight cases and take additional actions to prevent sales 
  taxes from being paid in the future. </p>
<p>Our review also showed that sensitive property procurements, such as computer 
  equipment and cameras were not always entered in property management records 
  as required by NIH. We were advised by NIH officials that this was due to a 
  computer programming error which was corrected after we called it to NIH's attention. 
</p>
<p>We are recommending that NIH: <br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>fully evaluate the effectiveness of controls over the card purchase program 
    which compensate for the lack of separation of duties;<br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>ensure that cardholders pay no more State sales taxes on card purchases;<br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>revise the property module designed for card purchases so all object classes 
    designated for sensitive and accountable property trigger electronic alerts 
    to the property management officials to place decals on such property and 
    enter them into the property management system; and<br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>review all card purchases and identify all sensitive equipment items that 
    should have been entered into the property management system and enter them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The NIH generally concurred with our recommendations. </p>
<p>The National Performance Review (NPR) Report issued by the Vice President in 
  1993 recommended that agencies promote the use of purchase cards to realize 
  savings of administrative costs associated with making small purchases. Based 
  on February 1997 card purchase volume, we estimated that NIH's annual card purchase 
  volume to be about $17.4 million. The NIH officials advised us that they are 
  planning to increase the annual card purchases to about $100 million. We believe 
  that this goal is reasonable. Further, we believe that NIH can increase card 
  purchases to about $152 million annually if they make card purchases the preferred 
  means of making small purchases of up to $2,500, as requested by the Deputy 
  Assistant Secretary for Grants and Acquisition Management (DASGAM). We believe 
  that at such a volume NIH can save about $4 million in administrative costs 
  annually. </p>
