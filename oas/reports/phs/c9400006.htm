<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG) review 
  of policies and procedures for medical personnel credentialing and privileging 
  in the Indian Health Service (IHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and 
  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). </p>
<p>The objectives of our review were to assess the adequacy of Federal policies 
  and procedures for credentialing and privileging: 
<ol>
  <li>in IHS and NIH direct care facilities; and<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>in nonfederally operated, community-based programs that receive funding 
    through contracts and grants with IHS and HRSA.</li>
</ol>
<p>The credentialing and privileging policies used by facilities operated directly 
  by IHS and NIH are adequate, but Federal credentialing and privileging requirements 
  for nonfederally operated IHS and HRSA funded community-based programs need 
  to be strengthened.<br>
  <br wp="br1">
  <strong>Finding 1</strong> 
<dl> 
  <dd>The credentialing and privileging policy prescribed by the Public Health 
    Service Interagency Advisory Council on Quality Assurance and Risk Management 
    (Interagency Council) compares favorably with other governmental policies 
    and professional literature publications. Further, both IHS and NIH have credentialing 
    requirements that meet or exceed the minimum level established by the interagency 
    policy.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong>Finding 2</strong></dt>
  <dd><br wp="br1">
    In contrast, nonfederally operated, tribal health care programs funded by 
    IHS are not required to follow IHS' credentialing and privileging policies. 
    In addition, HRSA provides its grantees limited policy instructions on appropriate 
    credentialing and privileging steps. Without adequate credentialing and privileging 
    policies, the Federal Government risks increased liability for acts of malpractice 
    that occur in these programs. Therefore, it is incumbent upon IHS and HRSA 
    to encourage their fi-mded programs to adhere to stringent credentialing and 
    privileging requirements.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong>Finding 3</strong></dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>The IHS and HRSA are also not required to determine whether providers they 
    hire are excluded from being reimbursed by the Federal Medicare and State 
    Medicaid programs. By not conducting a search of the exclusion list, IHS and 
    HRSA run the risk of employing health care professionals who have been convicted 
    of crimes relating to ethical or professional wrongdoing. </dd>
</dl>
<p>To strengthen requirements and provide more specific guidance on credentialing 
  and privileging to community-based programs receiving Federal funding, we recommend 
  that: 
<ul>
  <li>the Director of IHS advocate programs for quality and risk management, specifically 
    those related to credentialing and privileging of medical personnel in self-determination 
    tribal health care programs;<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>the Administrator of HRSA disseminate detailed information on the operation 
    of a comprehensive credentialing and privileging program to community, migrant, 
    homeless, and public housing health center grantees;<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>the IHS and HRSA modify their employment or credentialing policies and practices 
    to require, as a routine procedure, a search of the Department of Health and 
    Human Services (HHS) OIG Medicare and Medicaid exclusion list; and<br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li>the Interagency Council revise its credentialing policy to require a search 
    of HHS' OIG Medicare and Medicaid exclusion list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In responding to our draft report, IHS, HRSA, and NIH concurred with our findings 
  and recommendations. </p>
