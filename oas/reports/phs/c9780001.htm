<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) awards 
  grants to provide funding to individuals for graduate training or development 
  in psychology, psychiatry, nursing, and social work. Generally, trainees are 
  required to repay each month of financial support through an equal period of 
  service to underserved mentally ill populations in public facilities. If the 
  trainee fails to satisfy this service obligation, the trainee must repay the 
  Federal Government three times the cost of the traineeship plus interest. The 
  SAMHSA contracts with a private corporation to monitor and track the appointments 
  and payback activities of trainees. Our final report points out that the contractor 
  did not adequately fulfill this responsibility. The contractor did not identify 
  and refer for debt collection the trainees who did not satisfy their service 
  payback obligation. Also, the contractor did not audit and report on the service 
  payback status of trainees in debt collection. As a result collection actions 
  were not taken against trainees who owed the Federal Government approximately 
  $260,000. We recommended that SAMHSA ensure the contractor complies with contract 
  requirements, require the contractor to audit the status of the service payback 
  activities of all trainees, and implement procedures to refer trainees, who 
  default on their payback obligations, to the Office of Inspector General for 
  exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The SAMHSA 
  concurred with our recommendations. </p>
