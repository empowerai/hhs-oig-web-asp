<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that Public Health Service (PHS) policies 
  and procedures do not assure that all programs and missions are identified for 
  management control reviews as required by the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity 
  Act (FMFIA). As a result, audits have disclosed many programs not subjected 
  to the management oversight intended by this law. An improved process should 
  provide reasonable assurance that all major management control weaknesses have 
  been identified and corrected through effective FMFIA compliance. Our report 
  contains recommendations for improving this process. </p>
