<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of compliance by the Food and 
  Drug Administration (FDA) with the Prompt Payment Act (Act). The audit objectives 
  were to determine whether FDA meets Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular 
  A-l 25, &quot;Prompt Payment&quot; requirements for having an adequate payment 
  process to pay bills on-time, accurately reporting payments and progress made 
  with respect to complying with the Act, and assessing its payment process. </p>
<p>We found that FDA's payment process does not meet OMB's performance standard 
  for paying bills on time, and reports of payments and progress made with respect 
  to complying with the Act are inaccurate. The FDA does not assess the process 
  used for making most payments and processes at the headquarter's office that 
  are assessed are not comprehensive. </p>
<p>The report contains recommendations for improving FDA's process of making payments, 
  of reporting on progress and problems, and of assessing the reliability of its 
  payment process. The FDA concurred with most of our recommendations when commenting 
  on the draft report. We believe that full implementation of our recommendations 
  would materially improve the credibility of FDA's assertions that it is in compliance 
  with the Act. </p>
