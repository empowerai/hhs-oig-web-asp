<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our follow-up review of the 
  Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) progress in implementing recommendations 
  contained in a prior report issued in July 1990. In that report we made recommendations 
  on how the generic drug management information system could be better used by 
  FDA to improve management and oversight of the generic drug review and approval 
  process. Although the FDA has taken certain actions to implement the recommendations 
  made in the previous report, more needs to be done. In the follow-up report 
  we have made several recommendations to further improve the generic drug management 
  information system. </p>
