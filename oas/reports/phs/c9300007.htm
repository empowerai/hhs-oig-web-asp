<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick (KPMG), independent public 
  accountants, under contract with the Office of Inspector General indicates opportunity 
  for improving financial management at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
  The Chief Financial Officers Act requires that the audit report be prepared 
  in accordance with <u>Government Auditing Standards</u> and the Office of Management 
  and Budget's Bulletin 93-06, <u>Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements</u>. 
  The KPMG's auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on FDA's Revolving Fund 
  for Certification and Other Services' (Fund) financial statements but found 
  problems with internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations in 
  the areas of input and processing controls, overhead allocation, and proprietary 
  and budgetary account balancing. They also found that while some prior year 
  problems were resolved, other problems found in the previous year's audit have 
  not been fully resolved. </p>
