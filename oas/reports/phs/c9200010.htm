<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report was prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick (KPMG), certified public 
  accountants, under contract with the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The 
  audit of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Superfund 
  transactions was performed to comply with provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental 
  Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which requires 
  the Inspector General of each Federal organization with Superfund responsibilities 
  to conduct an annual audit of the uses of Superfund monies to assure the fund 
  is being properly administered. The auditors identified deficiencies in ATSDR's 
  payroll and timekeeping functions. Also, the audit disclosed a discrepancy in 
  the Department of Health and Human Services Accounting Manual concerning operating 
  divisions' responsibility for developing and implementing a system of internal 
  controls to assure that grant recipients only withdraw cash as it is needed 
  to meet expenditures incurred under the grant. </p>
