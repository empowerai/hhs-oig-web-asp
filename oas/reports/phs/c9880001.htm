<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides results of review of the National Institutes of 
  Health (NIH) printing program made to determine whether the program was complying 
  with laws and regulations applicable to the Government Printing Office's (GPO) 
  requirements. The report notes the NIH did not report its monthly commercial 
  printing activity to GPO as required. Also, the NIH did not always provide copies 
  of printed publications to GPO for distribution to Federal Depository Libraries 
  and for purposes of cataloging and indexing. Recommendations call for actions 
  the NIH needs to take to meet the GPO's requirements. The NIH fully concurred 
  with our recommendations. </p>
