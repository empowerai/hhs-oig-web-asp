<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report points out that standard medical care is provided at no charge 
  to research patients at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center 
  for treatment for medical conditions unrelated to research. Moreover, standard 
  medical care was provided to some patients who were not even participating in 
  research. We believe such care should be billable to insurers and other third 
  party payers. We recommended that: (1) NIH modify its accounting and information 
  systems to collect the full cost of treating patients, (2) segregate research 
  costs from nonresearch care costs by patient, (3) collect insurance and financial 
  information from patients, and (4) seek authority to charge for nonresearch 
  care provided to patients. The Public Health Service (PHS) forwarded our report 
  to a workgroup established to review activities of the Department, including 
  operations of the Clinical Center, under REGO II (the second phase of the National 
  Performance Review's efforts to reinvent Government). The PHS will revisit our 
  recommendations in conjunction with those of the workgroup to determine an appropriate 
  course of action. </p>
