<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
  has not taken sufficient action to correct a material weakness in FDA's generic 
  drug approval process. The FDA needs to: (1) modify the method by which generic 
  drug applications are assigned to reviewers to remove any opportunity for showing 
  partiality or favoritism; (2) revise its &quot;first-in, first-reviewed&quot; 
  policy for generic drugs because the current policy may allow for the unequal 
  treatment of drug firms' applications; (3) develop comprehensive guidelines 
  to assure that generic drug applications are reviewed in a uniform and consistent 
  manner; and (4) establish a quality control review system outside the Office 
  of Generic Drugs to ensure the propriety of individual generic drug application 
  reviews and the integrity of the review process. </p>
