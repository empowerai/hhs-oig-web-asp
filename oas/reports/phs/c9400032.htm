<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of Compliance with the Prompt 
  Payment Act (Act) by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The audit objectives 
  were to determine whether NIH pays bills on-time, remits interest penalties 
  when payments are made late, and takes discounts that are advantageous to the 
  Government; accurately reports payments and progress made with respect to complying 
  with the Act; and assesses the reliability of its payment process. </p>
<p>We found that the NIH made late payments for 20 percent of the 657,058 invoices 
  in Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 that were subject to the Act. It incurred interest 
  penalties of $242,221. This occurred because quality controls in the NIH payment 
  process needs to be streamlined. </p>
<p>We recommended that NIH improve quality controls in its payment process to: 
<ul>
  <li>require that invoices be processed within the established OMB time frames 
    and date stamped in an office other than the Accounts Payable Section; and 
    that the payment system automatically authorizes payment after the purchase 
    order, invoice, and report of receipt of goods are reconciled; <br>
  </li>
  <li>computing interest penalties through the payment date as required by the 
    Act; and <br>
  </li>
  <li>recording and making discount determinations automatically by electronically 
    comparing discount terms with the Department of Treasury's Current Value of 
    Funds. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommended that NIH routinely assess the reliability of its payment 
  process as required by the Act. The NIH generally agreed with our recommendations.
