<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Since 1983, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has provided $1.7 billion 
  in financial support to small business concerns to perform research projects 
  under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR). This final report 
  points out that the NIH does not ensure that all SBIR grantees comply with invention 
  reporting requirements found in regulations that require grantees to disclose 
  inventions and patents to the funding agencies. Also, the NIH does not evaluate 
  the success of its SBIR Program in commercialization of research. Measuring 
  such success or lack thereof should be an important management objective. Recommendations 
  call for actions the NIH needs to take to become more effective in protecting 
  intellectual property rights and improve administration of the SBIR program.
