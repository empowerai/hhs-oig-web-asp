<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report presents the results of our follow-up review of our May 1991 
  report entitled, &quot;Need for the Food and Drug Administration to Review Improper 
  Pre-Approval Promotional Activities&quot; (A-15-91-00007). The May 1991 review 
  looked at possible pre-approval promotion of bovine somatotropin (bST), a new 
  animal drug developed to increase milk production in cows, which was still under 
  review by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CMV). Our current review 
  found that CVM took appropriate corrective action in anticipation of recommendations 
  made in our May 1991 report. In addition, CVM appropriately concluded that, 
  overall, Monsanto-sponsored focus groups and a video produced beginning in December 
  1992 did not violate the intent of Federal regulations. However, we also found 
  that CVM should have issued a warning letter stating that regulatory action 
  would be taken should violative activities occurring at a January 1993 university 
  seminar continue. The report makes recommendations to ensure that the Federal 
  regulations governing pre-approval promotion is revised, in part, to address 
  activities that sponsors can undertake while still being in compliance with 
  this regulation. The PHS generally agreed with our recommendations. </p>
