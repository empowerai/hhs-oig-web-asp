<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>In September 1993 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed Greenwich 
  Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Greenwich) that its new drug application (NDA) for a 
  new drug (Therafectin) to treat rheumatoid arthritis could not be approved because 
  there was not adequate data demonstrating the drug's effectiveness. Subsequently, 
  Congressman John D. Dingle requested that the OIG review Greenwich's concerns 
  that the FDA did not follow applicable administrative procedures in reviewing 
  the drug application. We found that, in general, the FDA did properly process 
  the Therafectin NDA. We noted certain administrative shortcomings, but found 
  no evidence that they affected the approval status of the NDA. In the final 
  analysis, Greenwich was not able to adequately demonstrate--either to the FDA 
  or an Arthritis Advisory Committee--that Therafectin was effective for the treatment 
  of rheumatoid arthritis. As a result of this matter the FDA is instituting administrative 
  improvements to strengthen the NDA review process. </p>
