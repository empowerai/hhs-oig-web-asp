<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our follow-up review to determine progress 
  by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in implementing recommendations made 
  by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in its November 1991 report entitled, 
  &quot;Major NIH Computer System--Poor Management Resulted in Unmet Scientists' 
  Needs and Wasted Millions&quot; (GAO/IMTEC-92-5). </p>
<p>The GAO reported that NIH did not: 
<ul>
  <li>effectively manage its mainframe computer capacity; <br>
  </li>
  <li>acquire computers for administrative processing in a straightforward manner. 
    The GAO stated that NIH had improperly used the critical nature of scientists' 
    work to justify the large computers it wanted without anyone questioning its 
    decisions. The GAO found that NIH needed to eliminate the excess administrative 
    processing capacity it acquired after obtaining authority to purchase computers 
    on the basis that they were needed for scientific research; <br>
  </li>
  <li>successfully promote competition; and <br>
  </li>
  <li>adequately assess the computing needs of scientists. The GAO concluded that 
    NIH needed to require its senior information resources management (IRM) officials 
    to take the lead role in future major system acquisitions by developing a 
    strategic plan and otherwise ensuring that acquisitions support the mission 
    of NIH. </li>
</ul>
<p>The NIH concurred with corrective actions GAO recommended and, in Fiscal Year 
  (FY) 1996, reported that it had completed the corrective actions. </p>
