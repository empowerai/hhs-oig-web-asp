<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report provides the results of our audit of the Agency for 
  Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Superfund financial activities 
  for Fiscal Year (FY) 1990. Through interagency agreements with the Environmental 
  Protection Agency, ATSDR obligated $45.2 million and disbursed $43.9 million 
  in Superfund resources during FY 1990. This report concludes that, in general, 
  ATSDR administered the fund in accordance with requirements. Superfund transactions 
  for FY 1990 generally were properly and accurately recorded and reported by 
  ATSDR. Supporting documentation showed that the transactions were for valid 
  Superfund activities. </p>
<p>In addition to auditing ATSDR's FY 1990 disbursements, we analyzed the conditions 
  cited in a recently issued General Accounting Office (GAO) report relating to 
  ATSDR's health assessment program. We determined the deficiencies were of such 
  magnitude that the Department of Health and Human Services should report them 
  as a material internal control weakness; that ATSDR had not made provision for 
  all of its program activities for internal control reviews under the Federal 
  Managers' Financial Integrity Act; and that ATSDR had not developed and implemented 
  a detailed corrective action plan to ensure the expeditious implementation of 
  the GAO's recommendations. </p>
