<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report addresses weaknesses in control procedures designed to detect 
  and prevent actual and perceived conflicts-of-interest involving the National 
  Institutes of Health's (NIH) 235 advisory committees. Advisory committees consist 
  of outside experts and professional peers who provide advice about biomedical 
  research direction and how research monies should be spent. We found that NIH's 
  procedures were not sufficient to detect conflicts-of-interest in its advisory 
  committees that provide advice and direction to the directors of NIH Institutes, 
  Centers and Divisions. We recommend that NIH implement corrective actions to 
  improve the internal controls over conflicts-of-interest. </p>
