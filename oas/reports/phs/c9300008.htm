<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report, prepared by Price Waterhouse (PW), certified public 
  accountants, presents the results of their audit of the National Institutes 
  of Health's Management and Service and Supply Funds financial statements for 
  the Fiscal Year ended September 30, 1992. The PW auditors found significant 
  internal control weaknesses, and noncompliance with the Department of Health 
  and Human Services' accounting manual that had not yet been corrected from the 
  prior year's audit. The most significant problems are in the areas of inventory 
  management, property and equipment, and accounts payable. The areas of inventory 
  management and property and equipment were declared material weaknesses in its 
  December 1992 Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) report. We believe 
  that a material weakness in accounts payable meets the Office of Management 
  and Budgets criteria for a material internal control weakness that should be 
  reported to the President and Congress. </p>
