<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report responds to congressional concerns about allegations regarding 
  conflicts-of-interest that could affect the credibility of a study of adverse 
  consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. Our review identified conflicts-of-interest 
  for two committee members. One individual was employed by a gateway.html fund 
  that was fully supported by a DPT manufacturer. Another resigned after the Institute 
  of Medicine Study learned that the person had made public statements in a legal 
  deposition on the effects of DPT vaccines. We also found that NIH failed to 
  assure the impartiality and objectivity of work performed under this advisory 
  and assistance contract. </p>
