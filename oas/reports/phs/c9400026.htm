<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report provides our assessment of financial management controls 
  relative to events surrounding a request to reprogram $1.4 million to the Hansen's 
  Disease Program. The report points out that the Health Resources and Services 
  Administration (HRSA) improperly transferred $1.4 million of Hansen's Disease 
  Program obligations to the National Health Service Corps. The transfers violated 
  the requirement that an obligation be charged to the account for which it was 
  incurred. The improper charges were reversed after the reprogramming request 
  was approved. Among other things, recommendations call for HRSA and the Public 
  Health Service to enhance staff awareness that justification for and review 
  of obligations and deobligations be documented, that overobligations be timely 
  reported as required, and to separate Hansen's disease activities from unrelated 
  programs. </p>
