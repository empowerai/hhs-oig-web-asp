<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report discusses the need for the Department of Health and Human 
  Services (Department) to strengthen its controls over the hiring and managing 
  of appointed consultants and experts. Our review disclosed that the internal 
  controls over hiring and managing consultants and experts needs strengthening 
  to ensure that consultants and experts: are free from financial conflicts-of-interest; 
  are not improperly detailed and recertified; time and attendance is accurately 
  reported; quality of work is evaluated; and hiring approvals are obtained in 
  compliance with prevailing policies and procedures. Also, we found many instances 
  of noncompliance with prescribed policies, procedures and regulations. </p>
