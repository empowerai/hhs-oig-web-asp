<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has 
  not maintained a complete and accurate payback file (data base) to adequately 
  monitor recipients of National Research Service Awards (NRSA). Several factors 
  contributed to the problems with this data base. Most significantly, NIH components 
  did not always follow established policies and procedures for maintaining the 
  data base and NIH's automated system did not always perform the functions needed 
  to update the data base when new information was entered. As a result, NIH could 
  not readily verify the current payback status for over 4,100 NRSA recipients, 
  or the financial debts they potentially owe the Government. Recommendations 
  call for action NIH needs to take to ensure proper maintenance of the data base. 
  The NIH concurred with our recommendations and formed a &quot;Payback Workgroup&quot; 
  to begin work to identify the extent of the problems and implement the necessary 
  corrective actions. </p>
