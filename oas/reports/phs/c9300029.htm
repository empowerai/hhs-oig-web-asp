<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report points out weaknesses in the National Institutes of Health's 
  (NIH) procedures for monitoring compliance with provisions of the Patent and 
  Trademark Amendments Act (Act) of 1980 at the Scripps Research Institute (SRI) 
  of La Jolla, California. The NIH was not aware of inventions being developed 
  at SRI with NIH grant funds, and therefore could not provide assurance that 
  the objectives of the Act were being met. Information from NIH showed that only 
  51 (41 percent) of the 125 patents awarded to SRI were developed with help from 
  Federal grant funds. However, after we raised questions about the accuracy of 
  SRI's reporting, SRI, on June 30, 1993, revealed to NIH that 96 of its patents 
  were developed with the help of Federal funds. We are recommending the NIH determine 
  if SRI properly reported all patented inventions and that NIH establish procedures 
  to better monitor SRI's compliance with the Act. </p>
