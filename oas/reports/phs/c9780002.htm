<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report presents the results of the Office of Inspector General's 
  review of internal controls over purchase card activities at the Food and Drug 
  Administration's (FDA) headquarters components. The FDA began using the VISA 
  purchase cards in 1989. The Purchase cards work much like personal credit cards, 
  enabling designated FDA employees to purchase goods or services costing, for 
  the most part, $2500 or less without much of the administration and paperwork 
  required by the standard procurement system. We found that FDA had not formally 
  assessed the effectiveness of compensating controls over the use of purchase 
  cards. Such controls are necessary because certain basic controls, such as separation 
  of duties, are inherently missing in the purchase card system. We recommended 
  that FDA evaluate the effectiveness of compensating controls over the purchase 
  card system. We also found several minor problems with FDA's use of purchase 
  cards. We found that FDA had improperly paid State sales tax in 3 of 174 randomly 
  selected transactions, and in one instance did not properly enter in its property 
  management records 2 sensitive accountable property items. We also noted that 
  the FDA's Division of Accounting leased a software package for $24,900, to automate 
  its purchase card activities without coordinating with FDA's Office of Information 
  Resources Management which is responsible for such initiatives. The FDA concurred 
  with all of our findings and our recommendation that FDA evaluate the effectiveness 
  of compensating controls over the purchase card system.</p>
