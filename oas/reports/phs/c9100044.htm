<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report prepared by Clifton, Gunderson and Company (CGC), certified 
  public accountants, presents the results of their audit of the National Institutes 
  of Health's Management and Service and Supply Funds (Funds) financial statements 
  for the fiscal year ended 1991. The CGC did not express an opinion on the financial 
  statements because of concerns about amounts shown for (1) inventory, (2) property, 
  plant and equipment and related accumulated depreciation, (3) accounts payable, 
  and (4) accrued expenses. They found significant internal control weaknesses, 
  and noncompliance with Title 2--the General Accounting Office's Policy and Procedures 
  Manual for Guidance to Federal Agencies (which is incorporated in the Department's 
  accounting guidance). </p>
