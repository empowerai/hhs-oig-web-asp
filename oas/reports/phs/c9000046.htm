<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>Our audit of the FDA's review of the new animal drug bovine somatotropin (bST) 
  found that research was conducted to demonstrate both that bST is not harmful 
  to humans, and that bST levels in milk are not higher in bST-treated cows than 
  in non-treated cows. Our review also showed that FDA and Monsanto appropriately 
  withheld animal health data on bST, but FDA publicly disclosed the data it reviewed 
  on human food safety. The FDA concurred with our recommendation that the Commissioner 
  of FDA develop policies and procedures on the type of public statements that 
  can be made regarding a new animal drug undergoing review. </p>
