<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report presents the results of OIG's audit of the effectiveness 
  of CDC in resolving issues of missing property and the adequacy of CDC's FY 
  1993 review of management controls over property. Our audit found that items 
  unaccounted for during CDC's FY 1992 inventory were unaccounted for in the FY 
  1993 inventory. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>We recommended that CDC strengthen management controls over property by: (1) 
  promptly resolving missing property; (2) performing reconciliations as required 
  by HHS; (3) separating key duties within CDC property management functions to 
  maintain an adequate system of checks and balances; (4) conducting a management 
  control review of property management which fully complies with standards; and 
  (5) establishing and promoting the use of a hotline for the anonymous referral 
  of information on property at risk. The Public Health Service generally concurred 
  with our recommendations. </p>
