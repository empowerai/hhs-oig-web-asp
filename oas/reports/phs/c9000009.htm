<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our evaluation of potential conflicts-of-interest 
  involving the September 1989 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development 
  Conference (Conference) on the &quot;Treatment of Destructive Behaviors in Persons 
  with Developmental Disabilities.&quot; Critics claimed that the Conference's 
  &quot;sanctioning&quot; of a controversial pain-inflicting electrical device, 
  called the Self-injurious Behavior Inhibiting System, resulted from &quot;cozy 
  relationships and financial ties&quot; involving Conference officials and promoters 
  of the device. We found no evidence that Conference officials gained financially. 
  We also found no evidence that these associations influenced the Conference 
  officials in their decisions concerning the device. Rather, the Conference concluded 
  that the device and other aversive treatments should be discouraged and used 
  only under restrictive conditions. Our review did, however, disclose that NIH 
  had not implemented effective internal control techniques for identifying, documenting, 
  and evaluating potential conflicts-of-interest for Conference officials. In 
  addition, we found that no internal control review has been conducted of the 
  consensus development conference program as intended under the Federal Managers' 
  Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA). We recommended that an internal control review 
  be periodically conducted of the consensus development conference program in 
  accordance with FMFIA requirements. The Public Health Service concurred with 
  our recommendation. </p>
