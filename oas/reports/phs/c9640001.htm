<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of compliance with the Prompt 
  Payment Act by the Division of Fiscal Services (DFS) within the Financial Management 
  Service of the Program Support Center. The report contains recommendations to 
  improve compliance with the Prompt Payment Act by assuring that goods and services 
  paid for are received, discounts that are advantageous to the government are 
  taken, and payments made under the Act are accurately reported.</p>
<p>We recommended that DFS: 
<ul>
  <li>use the existing payment system to identify all instances where goods and 
    services have been reported as paid for, but not received to (1) assess and 
    correct problems with the payment system and (2) obtain reimbursement from 
    the payee in instances where goods and services were found to have not been 
    received;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>modify the payment system to require that discount data be recorded in the 
    payment system before payments can be processed;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>use actual results that are available when compiling Prompt Payment Status 
    reports and, before submitting the reports to OMB, verify that the reports 
    reflect all of the DFS and IHS field offices; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>provide written policies and procedures to all reporting entities for performing 
    quality assurance reviews. Reviewers should be instructed to: (1) examine 
    receiving reports or other original documentation when verifying whether goods 
    and services have actually been received and (2) assess the payment system 
    to assure the system accurately identifies whether goods and services paid 
    for have been received.</li>
</ul>
<p>In responding to our draft report, the DFS generally agreed with all our recommendations.
