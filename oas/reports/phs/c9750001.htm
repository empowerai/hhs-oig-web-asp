<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>As a Federal purchaser of inpatient health care from the private sector, the 
  Indian Health Service (IHS) should be receiving rates commensurate with other 
  Federal agencies who engage in similar purchases. However, IHS paid an aggregate 
  $4.8 million more than Medicare rates for services provided in Fiscal Year 1995--an 
  amount that included $8.2 million paid to hospitals over Medicare rates, reduced 
  by $3.4 million for certain instances where IHS actually paid hospitals less 
  than Medicare rates. The IHS is paying too much because there is no law requiring 
  providers to offer Medicare or lower rates, and IHS has not been fully successful 
  in its efforts to obtain favorable rates through contracts and other procurement 
  mechanisms. The IHS concurred with our recommendation to pursue legislative 
  action requiring favorable Medicare or lower rates for payment of IHS health 
  services. </p>
