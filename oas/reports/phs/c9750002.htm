<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final audit report points out that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
  does not have an effective process for handling citizen petitions in a timely 
  manner, as evidenced by a backlog of about 250 petitions that have not been 
  fully answered, some dating to the 1970's and early 1980's. Regulations require 
  responses to citizen petitions within 180 days. The backlog of pending petitions 
  includes issues that the petitioners believe are matters of public safety, and 
  some have requested FDA to ban or withdraw approval of certain products. In 
  situations where the FDA does not answer petitions in a timely manner, the public 
  may lose confidence in the regulatory process. Because the citizen petition 
  process is not a high priority at FDA, the agency has provided limited resources 
  to the process, and there is little central oversight of the process across 
  FDA program areas. The FDA generally concurred with our recommendations on actions 
  FDA should take to reduce the backlog and more effectively manage the process 
  for responding to citizen petitions. </p>
