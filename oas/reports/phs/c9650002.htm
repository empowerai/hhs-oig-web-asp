<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This report provides the results of our review of the Food and Drug Administration's 
  (FDA) handling of issues related to conjugated estrogens (Premarin), a commonly 
  prescribed product for menopausal symptoms and the prevention and management 
  of osteoporosis. This review was performed at the request of the Chairman, Subcommittee 
  on Oversight and Investigations, House Committee on Commerce. </p>
<p>The FDA is the Federal agency responsible for approving applications to market 
  new drugs, new indications for already marketed drugs, and generic versions 
  of brand name drugs. Conjugated estrogens products represent a class of marketed 
  drugs used primarily for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in women and for 
  the prevention and management of osteoporosis, a crippling disease that causes 
  thinning of the bone. Wyeth-Ayerst is a drug manufacturer that markets: (1) 
  Premarin, approved in 1942, which is made from the urine of pregnant mares and 
  is the Nation's only conjugated estrogens product; and (2) Prempro, approved 
  in 1994, which combines Premarin and another hormone called progestin. At this 
  time, there are no approved applications to market generic versions of these 
  brand name drugs. </p>
<p>Once a drug is approved, drug manufacturers are required to obtain FDA's approval 
  before adding or deleting an ingredient, or otherwise changing the composition 
  of a drug product, other than deletion of an ingredient intended only to affect 
  the color of the drug product. Current regulations require that when there is 
  a change in the manufacturing process, including a change in product formulation 
  or dosage strength, beyond the variations provided for in the approved application, 
  drug manufacturers are required to show that any reformulations are bioequivalent 
  to the approved product. </p>
<p>The FDA uses a process called the citizen petition to allow anyone--individuals 
  or companies--to request the agency to make changes to its regulations. In November 
  1994, Wyeth-Ayerst submitted a citizen petition requesting FDA to: (1) recognize 
  an ingredient of Premarin--delta 8,9 (dehydroestrone sulfate (DHES))--as an 
  essential (but not an active) ingredient in Premarin; and (2) not approve any 
  generic version of Premarin that does not contain DHES. The firm amended its 
  petition in December 1996 to request FDA to recognize DHES as an active ingredient. 
  To date, FDA has not made a decision as to whether to approve Wyeth-Ayerst's 
  citizen petition request. However, on May 5, 1997, FDA's Director, Center for 
  Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), announced that, because the active ingredients 
  of Premarin have not been adequately defined, the agency could not at this time 
  approve generic applications for synthetic versions of conjugated estrogens. 
  The FDA had been reviewing two such applications since 1994 and 1995, respectively. 
</p>
<p>The House Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, 
  has raised concerns that Wyeth-Ayerst may have made misrepresentations in its 
  submissions to FDA regarding Premarin, and that FDA may have failed to adequately 
  review such submissions. The Subcommittee requested the Office of Inspector 
  General (OIG) in July 1996 to answer specific questions regarding: Premarin, 
  another Wyeth-Ayerst product called Prempro, the citizen petition related to 
  Premarin, and generic versions of Premarin. </p>
<p>Our objective was to answer the Subcommittee's questions in the following three 
  areas: <br
wp="br1">
<ol>
  <li><u>Premarin:</u> The questions focused on possible unapproved reformulations; 
    whether the reformulations were bioequivalent; and the basis on which FDA 
    allowed the continued marketing of Premarin.<br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li><u>Prempro:</u> The question focused on the basis on which Wyeth-Ayerst 
    won approval for Prempro's use in the prevention and management of osteoporosis.<br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
  <li><u>Wyeth-Ayerst's citizen petition regarding Premarin and generic versions 
    of Premarin:</u> The questions focused on FDA's examination of data and claims 
    made in Wyeth-Ayerst's citizen petition and the agency's handling of brand 
    name and generic versions of Premarin.<br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
  </li>
</ol>
<p><u>Premarin:</u> According to FDA, there have been no unapproved formulations 
  of Premarin. Regarding the issue of bioequivalency among the formulations, however, 
  we found that FDA does not have evidence demonstrating that the currently marketed 
  formulation of Premarin is bioequivalent to the version tested for osteoporosis 
  in the late 1970's. This is because no in vivo (i.e., in the living body) bioequivalence 
  requirement was in effect for conjugated estrogens at that time. Concerned about 
  lack of bioequivalency data and the continued safety and effectiveness of Premarin, 
  FDA in 1993 directed Wyeth-Ayerst to conduct a new dose-ranging study of the 
  drug. As of January 1997, 818 women, or about 30 percent of the total planned 
  enrollment of 2,688, have entered into the multi-year study. </p>
<p><u>Prempro:</u> The Premarin tablet formulation used in the combination drug 
  Prempro (Premarin/medroxyprogesterone acetate) slightly differed from the marketed 
  Premarin, but Wyeth-Ayerst submitted in vivo bioequivalence data to demonstrate 
  that the new and currently marketed formulations were bioequivalent. </p>
<p><u>Citizen Petition and Generic Versions of Premarin:</u> The FDA is in the 
  process of reviewing the claims and data associated with Wyeth-Ayerst's citizen 
  petition, which was submitted to the agency over 2 years ago. The FDA has thus 
  far found deficiencies in the design of studies submitted to support Wyeth-Ayerst's 
  claims, but no misrepresentations in data in the firm's studies have been identified. 
  Regarding the Subcommittee's concern that FDA may have held generic drug firms 
  to a higher standard than the brand-name maker of Premarin, Wyeth-Ayerst, we 
  noted that the agency was also concerned about possible differing standards 
  in terms of bioequivalency requirements for the generic and brand name versions. 
  However, upon further investigation, FDA determined there were no unapproved 
  reformulations of the brand name Premarin that would have required Wyeth-Ayerst 
  to submit additional bioequivalency data. </p>
<p>Beyond the Subcommittee's specific questions, we identified other concerns 
  regarding the citizen petition process--namely that the process has been extended 
  for an excessive period of time in the Wyeth-Ayerst case; and FDA does not have 
  policies and procedures governing such an important process, one which can impact 
  the marketability of generic versions of Premarin. </p>
