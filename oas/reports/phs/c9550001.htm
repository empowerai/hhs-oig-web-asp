<strong> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong> 
<p>This final report provides the results of our review of the Food and Drug Administration's 
  (FDA) Center for Device and Radiological Health's (CDRH) controls for ensuring 
  the integrity of the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) and Investigational Device Exemption 
  (IDE) application review processes. In general, since 1992, CDRH has taken corrective 
  action that should enhance the integrity of these processes. However, we are 
  recommending that CDRH further strengthen the integrity of these decisionmaking 
  processes by fully implementing a program for conducting independent internal 
  quality control reviews. The FDA concurred with our recommendation. </p>
