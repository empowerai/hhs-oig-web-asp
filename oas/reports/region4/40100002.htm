<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This is the second of three reports being issued by the Office of Inspector General covering North Carolina&#146;s retroactive
  claims for child care.&nbsp; In this audit, our random sample of 200 IV-E child-care line items showed that 28 did not
  meet the requirements for Federal financial participation (FFP).&nbsp; As a result, the State was reimbursed $186,282 (FFP)
  for unallowable IV-E child-care payments.&nbsp; In our opinion, the unallowable payments were the result of the State&#146;s
  inadequate review of its consultant&#146;s identification of children who were to be determined eligible for a specific
  grant.&nbsp; In addition, each grant had different requirements; yet, the State&#146;s accounting system did not identify
  which grant program was used to pay for a child&#146;s care.&nbsp; Also, the claims did not have documentation to support
  eligibility factors and the need for services.&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund the $186,282 (FFP)
  overpayment; (2) develop accounting procedures that identify the grant used to pay for a child&#146;s care; (3) maintain
  documentation to support eligibility for all child-care claims for required periods; and (4) monitor its consultant to
  ensure that only allowable child-care claims are filed for FFP.&nbsp; State officials generally disagreed with our findings
  and recommendations.</p>
