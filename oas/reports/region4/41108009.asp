<h1>Audit (A-04-11-08009)</h1>

<h2>09-18-2012<br />
Allowability of Recovery Act Costs Claimed By Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., for the Period March 27, 2009, Through July 20, 2011</h2>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Of the $1.5 million in Recovery Act costs that the grantee claimed, $1.1 million was allowable under the terms of the grants and applicable Federal regulations.  However, we could not determine whether $351,000 of Increased Demand for Services (IDS) grant expenditures was allowable because the grantee did not account for IDS funds separately from other grant funds or maintain adequate personnel activity reports for each employee who worked on the grant.  The grantee received a total of $9.1 million in Recovery Act grants.  The grantee received $9.1 million in Recovery Act grants.</p>
<p>Additionally, the grantee's accounting practices did not meet all Federal requirements.  Specifically, the grantee did not identify in its asset records Federal equipment that it purchased with Federal funds, did not complete a timely reconciliation of equipment to its asset records, and occasionally allocated expenditures to the wrong grants.  As a result, the grantee risked exposing Federal assets to misappropriation and improper reporting of grant expenditures. </p>
<p>These oversights occurred because the grantee had insufficient controls over grant accounting, equipment, and reporting. </p>
