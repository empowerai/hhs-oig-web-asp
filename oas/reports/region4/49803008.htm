<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>We performed our audit work at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida (BCBSFL) serving as both the fiscal intermediary
  and carrier for the State of Florida. Our audit objective is to assist in expressing an opinion on the Health Care Financing
  Administration's (HCFA) Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 combined financial statements and to report on their compliance with laws
  and regulations. An aspect of overall work is to determine whether the Medicare fee-for-service benefit payments expenses
  are made in accordance with the provisions of Title XVIII and implementing regulations in Title 42 of the Code of Federal
  Regulations. Specifically, we were to determine if services were: (1) furnished by certified Medicare providers to eligible
  beneficiaries; (2) reimbursed by Medicare contractors in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations; and (3) medically
  necessary, accurately coded, and sufficiently documented in the beneficiaries' medical records. </p>
<p>We selected a stratified random sample of 50 beneficiaries for whom BCBSFL had adjudicated 779 claims during the second
  quarter of FY 1997 - our audit period. The BCBSFL paid $412,703 for these claims. With the assistance of BCBSFL and peer
  review organization medical review personnel, we identified overpayments totaling $41,126 for these claims. The overpayments
  occurred for various reasons, including insufficient documentation, incorrect coding of procedures, and lack of medical
  necessity. </p>
<p>Other independent auditors under contract with the Office of Inspector General identified reportable conditions with respect
  to electronic data processing (EDP) controls and non-claims activities and addressed recommendations in separate reports
  to BCBSFL. </p>
<p>We recommend that BCBSFL: (1) initiate recovery of the overpayments and periodically provide us with the status of recovery
  actions; and (2) address the recommendations made by the independent auditors with respect to EDP controls and non-claims
  activities and provide us a copy of such responses. </p>
<p>In a written response to our draft report, BCBSFL agreed to seek recovery of the overpayments and keep us apprised of
  the results. Also, BCBSFL generally agreed with the recommendations made by the independent auditors and has taken, or
  is taking, correction actions. Further, BCBSFL suggested that our report contain descriptions of the sampling methodology
  employed. This methodology is being described in the nationwide report to which this report contributes. Finally, BCBSFL
  agreed to address the concerns that we expressed in the &quot;Other Matters&quot; section of the report concerning ambulatory
  surgical center claims and cash receipts. </p>
