<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this nationwide review was to determine whether acute care hospitals complied with
  Medicare’s postacute care transfer policy during fiscal years (FYs) 2001 and 2002.&nbsp; We found that
  hospitals did not always comply with the transfer policy.&nbsp; Of 400 claims sampled, 381 were improperly
  coded as discharges to home rather than transfers to postacute care.&nbsp; Potential overpayments to
  hospitals for these claims totaled $1,034,588.&nbsp; The potential overpayments occurred because some
  hospitals did not have the necessary controls to ensure the accuracy of discharge status codes, and
  CMS lacked adequate payment system edits to prevent these overpayments.&nbsp; As a result, we estimate
  that Medicare overpaid hospitals approximately $72.4 million in FYs 2001 and 2002.&nbsp; We recommended
  that CMS: (1) instruct the fiscal intermediaries to recover, as appropriate, the $1,034,588 in potential
  overpayments identified in our sample; (2) instruct the fiscal intermediaries to review the remaining
  claims in our sampling universe and identify and recover additional overpayments; and (3) monitor hospitals
  that have a high number of claims adjusted as a result of recently implemented system edits and perform
  followup reviews, as appropriate, at specific hospitals.&nbsp; CMS agreed to implement the first and
  third recommendations.&nbsp; In regard to the second recommendation, CMS said that it was working on
  a strategy to identify and collect the remaining overpayments.</p>
