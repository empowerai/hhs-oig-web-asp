<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objectives were to determine whether the State Medicaid 
agency claimed Federal reimbursement for home and community-based services (HCBS) 
that were adequately supported in the providers’ records and provided in 
accordance with the beneficiaries’ approved plans of care.&nbsp; Based on our sample 
results, we estimate that during State fiscal year 2003, the State Medicaid 
agency claimed approximately $11 million ($7 million Federal share) for HCBS 
that were not supported by provider records.&nbsp; The Federal reimbursement for 
these unallowable claims occurred because the State Medicaid agency did not 
ensure that HCBS costs were allowable.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State Medicaid agency (1) refund to the Centers for 
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services the $7 million estimated excess Federal 
reimbursement for State fiscal year 2003; (2) direct the Division of Mental 
Retardation Services to establish controls and procedures to account for changes 
in the actual level of services provided, ensure that claims are adequately 
supported, and ensure that HCBS are rendered in accordance with the 
beneficiary’s plan of care; and (3) review its claims filed after our audit 
period and refund any overpayments identified.&nbsp; The State Medicaid agency did 
not specifically address our first recommendation.&nbsp; With respect to the second 
and third recommendations, the State Medicaid agency acknowledged that 
additional oversight and controls were needed and said that it had increased its 
monitoring efforts.</p>
