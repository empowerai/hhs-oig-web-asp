<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators (PGBA) serves as both the Medicare fiscal intermediary and carrier for the
  State of South Carolina as well as the durable medical equipment regional carrier and regional home health intermediary
  for several States. We determined whether Medicare claims paid by PGBA were reimbursed in accordance with Medicare laws
  and regulations. With the assistance of PGBA and peer review organization medical review personnel, we identified overpayments
  totaling $34,852 and underpayments totaling $1,239 for these claims during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 1998--our audit
  period. The overpayments and underpayments occurred for various reasons, including insufficient documentation, incorrect
  coding of procedures, and lack of medical necessity. We also identified two durable medical equipment payment errors which
  may indicate the need for PGBA to improve its claims processing edits. Officials of PGBA generally concurred with our recommendations
  for financial adjustments and procedural improvements. </p>
