<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report shows that the Shands Hospital at University of Florida (Hospital) did not use accurate data when
  reporting full-time equivalents (FTE) for claiming direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect graduate medical
  education (IME) costs.&nbsp; The Hospital (1) did not support all FTEs claimed, (2) included time spent in unallowable <i>activities</i> and <i>areas, </i>and
  (3) inappropriately classified specialty residents as primary care residents.&nbsp; Hospital officials reported FTEs for
  IME inaccurately because they experienced difficulty using revised software for electronic cost reporting.&nbsp; Had Hospital
  officials used the correct FTE numbers, the reimbursement amount derived within the cost report would have been much less
  than what was calculated using a separate spreadsheet model.&nbsp; Correction of the cost reports would result in increasing
  the Hospital’s 2-year claim for IME by $1,471,801 and reducing the 2-year claim for GME by $575,621.&nbsp; Hospital officials
  also reported that they have implemented procedures, where needed, to identify time spent in unallowable activities and
  areas.</p>
