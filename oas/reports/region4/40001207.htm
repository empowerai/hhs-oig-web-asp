<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether (1) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee (BCBSTN) had established
  effective systems on internal control, accounting and reporting for administrative costs and (2) the Final Administrative
  Cost Proposals (FACP) presented fairly, in all material respects, the costs of program administration for the Part A program
  in accordance with Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as interpreted and amended by Appendix B of BCBSTN's
  agreement with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). </p>
<p>We determined that BCBSTN had generally established adequate systems for internal control, accounting and reporting for
  administrative costs. Further, the administrative costs for the period October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1998 were
  generally in accordance with Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as interpreted and amended by Appendix B of
  BCBSTN's agreement with HCFA. However, we identified $352,840 in charges reported on the FACPs for which we recommend disallowance
  for the period October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1998. </p>
