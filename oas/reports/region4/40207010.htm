<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Mississippi Division 
  of Medicaid (DOM) had adequate internal controls to prevent providers that had 
  been excluded from participating in federal health care programs by the Office 
  of Inspector General from being enrolled in and paid by the Medicaid program.&nbsp; 
  We found that the Mississippi DOM did not have adequate internal controls to 
  prevent payments to such providers.&nbsp; As a result, the DOM paid $358,761 
  to excluded providers during state fiscal years 1997 through 2002.&nbsp; Improved 
  internal controls are needed to prevent excluded providers from participating 
  in the Medicaid program.</p>
