<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Boston Medical Center (the Hospital) included the
  appropriate number of dental residents in its full time equivalent (FTE) counts when computing
  Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments for fiscal years (FYs) 2000 through 2002.&nbsp; The
  Hospital inappropriately included a total of 120.15 direct GME FTEs and 113.80 indirect GME
  FTEs in the counts for FYs 2001 and 2002 without incurring all of the costs of training dental
  residents in nonhospital sites.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the Hospital: &nbsp;(1) file an amended cost report, which will result
  in a refund of the $4,927,120 associated with FTEs for which the Hospital did not incur all
  or substantially all of the training costs, (2) establish and follow written procedures to
  ensure that the FTE counts for residents in nonhospital settings include only those FTEs
  for which the Hospital has incurred all or substantially all of the training costs, and (3)
  determine whether errors similar to those identified in our review occurred in Medicare cost
  reports after FY 2002 and refund any overpayments.&nbsp; The Hospital generally disagreed
  with our findings and recommendations related to FY 2002, but did not address our findings
  and recommendations for FY 2001.</p>
