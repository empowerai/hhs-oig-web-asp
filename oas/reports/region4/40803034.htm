<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">For the period July 1, 2005, 
through June 30, 2006, we estimate that the Florida Agency for Health Care 
Administration (the State agency) paid $3.7 million<span style="color:red"> </span>($2.2 
million<span style="color:red"> </span>Federal share) on behalf of 
beneficiaries who should not have been eligible due to their Medicaid 
eligibility in Georgia.&nbsp; Medicaid eligibility in each State is based on 
residency.&nbsp; If a resident of one State subsequently establishes residency in 
another State, the beneficiary’s Medicaid eligibility in the previous State 
should end.&nbsp; From a statistical random sample of 100 beneficiary-months totaling 
$77,000 in Medicaid services, the State agency made payments for 68 
beneficiary-months totaling $68,000<span style="color:red"> </span>for services 
provided to beneficiaries who should not have been eligible to receive Medicaid 
benefits in Florida. &nbsp;Twenty-five beneficiary-months were for services to 
beneficiaries who were eligible to receive the benefit.&nbsp; For the remaining seven<span style="color:red">
</span>beneficiary-months totaling $522, we could not determine the 
beneficiaries’ eligibility based on the documentation that the State provided.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">We 
recommended that the State agency work with the Georgia Medicaid agency to share 
available Medicaid eligibility information for use in determining accurate 
beneficiary eligibility status and reducing the amount of payments made on 
behalf of beneficiaries residing in Georgia.&nbsp; We also 
recommended that the State agency work with CMS to determine the residency of beneficiaries 
whose eligibility could not be determined.&nbsp; The State agency deferred formal comments to the Florida 
Department of Children and Families (DCF), which DCF 
generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; However, n<span style="font-size:11.5pt">othing 
in the comments prompted 
changes to our findings or recommendations</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">.</span></p>
