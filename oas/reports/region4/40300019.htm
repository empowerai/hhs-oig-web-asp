<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to determine if the Kentucky Department for Medicaid Services (DMS):&nbsp; (1) accounted
  for on-demand payments to nursing facilities for the period October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2002; (2) used appropriate
  collection efforts to recoup interim payments; and (3) accounted for the Federal share of all write-offs and overpayment
  adjustments made for the quarters ended September 30, 2002 and December 30, 2002.&nbsp; We found that DMS did not properly
  account for on-demand payments to a nursing facility that resulted in overpayments totaling $165,416 (Federal share).&nbsp; DMS
  did use appropriate collection efforts to recoup payments made through its interim payment process and reimbursed the Federal
  share of the interim payments.&nbsp; However, DMS did not properly account for the Federal share of all write-offs.&nbsp; DMS
  reported $142,962 (Federal share) of write-offs on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS)-64 report for which it did
  not provide adequate support.&nbsp; In addition, the reporting process DMS used differs from the method CMS prescribed,
  and is vulnerable to reporting errors.&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements to correct
  noted weaknesses.&nbsp; DMS generally concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
