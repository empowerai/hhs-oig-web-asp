<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The audit objective was to evaluate whether the Kentucky Department for Medicaid Services had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.&nbsp; The audit covered Medicaid drug rebates through June
  30, 2002.&nbsp; We found that the State’s accounting records did not support amounts reported on the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp; As a result, there was no assurance that the program has provided CMS with an accurate
  picture of the drug rebate program.&nbsp; Additionally, there was a material amount of uncollected rebate dollars outstanding.&nbsp; State
  officials agreed with our findings and have taken steps to correct the identified weaknesses.</p>
