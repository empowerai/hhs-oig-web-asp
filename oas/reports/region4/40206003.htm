<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine
    the extent to which North Carolina used Medicaid funds to pay for prescription drugs and other (non-inpatient/long
    term care) health care services provided to inmates.&nbsp; Medicaid regulations provide that Medicaid
    will not cover outpatient services or the cost of prescription drugs for inmates.&nbsp; During the
    period October 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001, North Carolina’s controls were generally adequate
    to ensure that Medicaid did not pay for outpatient services and prescription drugs provided to incarcerated
    recipients.&nbsp; The State concurred with our overall finding.</p>
