<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to:&nbsp; (1) determine the amount of non-tax delinquent debt owed to Medicare that
  existed at September 30, 2000; and (2) assess the collectibility of the delinquent debt at the contractor level for the
  same period.&nbsp; The accounts receivable balances Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators (CGBA) reported to the Centers
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for financial statement purposes for the period ending September 30, 2000 for Part
  A (non-Medicare secondary payor (MSP) and MSP) accounts receivable was $500,831,731.&nbsp; We reconciled the subsidiary
  accounts for Part A to the general account.&nbsp; Other audit tests we performed on statistical samples of Part A non-MSP
  balances showed the vast majority of receivables were recorded, supported, complete, properly valued and existed at September
  30, 2000.&nbsp; However, we did recommend that the contractor:&nbsp; (1) correct the status codes on two accounts receivable
  balances to show the accurate status; (2) establish a system of internal controls that will provide adequate and timely
  tracking of its collections efforts; and (3) reduce the Part A MSP accounts receivable balance by over $17 thousand that
  were not adequately supported or had improperly applied payments. &nbsp; The CGBA officials concurred with the majority
  of the recommendations and agreed to take corrective action.</p>
