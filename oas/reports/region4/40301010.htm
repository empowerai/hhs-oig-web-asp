<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>This final report points out
  that the North Carolina Division of Public Health (North Carolina) generally
  accounted for program funds&nbsp;($3.37 million received for the 2-year period
  ending March 31, 2004) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cooperative
  agreement with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and
  applicable departmental regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; However, North Carolina
  did not track expenditures by phase, within phase, or by priority planning
  area in its accounting system.&nbsp; Although segregation was not required,
  budget restrictions were specified in the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; North
  Carolina officials acknowledged the importance of tracking expenditures in
  order to comply with the budget restrictions.&nbsp; North Carolina’s monitoring
  procedures facilitated the tracking and monitoring of subrecipient activities
  and expenditures.&nbsp; Further, North Carolina officials stated that HRSA
  funding had not been used to supplant programs previously provided by other
  organizational sources.&nbsp; We recommended North Carolina make changes to
  its accounting system and begin tracking expenditures by priority area, by
  critical benchmark, and by funds allocated to hospitals and other health care
  entities.&nbsp; North Carolina generally concurred with our findings and recommendations
  and stated it would take the necessary steps to fully comply with the HRSA
  grant guidelines.</p>
