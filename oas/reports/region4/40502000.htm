<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether selected home health claims that included therapy services
  provided by Total Patient Care Home Health, LLC (Total Patient Care) to Medicare beneficiaries met
  Federal requirements and were appropriately paid.&nbsp; Home health episodes with 10 or more therapy
  services result in an increased payment to home health agencies.&nbsp; A medical record review determined
  that 22 claims contained therapy services that were not reasonable.&nbsp; Projecting the results of
  the overpayments in our random sample to the universe, the provider received an estimated $63,425 in
  overpayments for claims billed to Medicare.</p>
<p>We recommended that Total Patient Care work with the Regional Home Health Intermediary to reimburse
  the Medicare program $63,425 for unallowable therapy services, identify and submit adjusted claims
  for Medicare overpayments received subsequent to our audit period, and strengthen controls to ensure
  that the therapy services provided are reasonable and medically necessary.&nbsp; In response to our
  draft report, Total Patient Care agreed with our findings.</p>
