<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that Coral Gables Hospital (Hospital) did not have adequate controls in place to ensure that the
  beneficiaries enrolled in the Hospital's partial hospitalization program (PHP) met Medicare eligibility criteria and that
  the services billed met the reimbursement requirements. As a result, based on a statistical projection at the 90 percent
  confidence level, we estimate that the hospital overstated its Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 Medicare outpatient psychiatric charges
  by $1,031,497. Further, our review showed that the PHP costs in the Hospital's FY 1997 cost report were overstated because
  the Hospital inappropriately included $1,648,063 in costs that were not related to the PHP operation. We recommended that
  the Hospital 1) strengthen its procedures to ensure that charges for outpatient psychiatric services are covered and properly
  documented in accordance with Medicare requirements and 2) develop procedures to properly exclude costs related to noncovered
  services from its Medicare cost reports. We will also provide the results of our review to the Fiscal Intermediary, so
  that it can apply the appropriate adjustments to the Hospital's FY 1997 Medicare cost report.</p>
