<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">We conducted a follow-up audit of Florida’s Medicaid drug 
rebate program to determine whether the State agency had (1) implemented the 
recommendations made in our previous audit of the Florida drug rebate program 
and (2) established controls over the drug rebate program, including the 
collection of rebates on single-source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; 
Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid 
funding by entering into a rebate agreement with CMS and paying quarterly 
rebates to the States.&nbsp; We found that the State had implemented the 
recommendations from our prior audit.&nbsp; Therefore, this report contains no 
recommendations.</p>
