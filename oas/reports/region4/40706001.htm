<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether
Windsor Health Plan of TN, Inc.’s (Windsor) 
anticipated administrative costs were actuarially supported and reasonably and 
equitably reflected revenue requirements in accordance with Federal 
regulations.&nbsp; Bid summary forms submitted by Windsor contained revenue 
estimates, including administrative costs, required for each plan.&nbsp; Windsor 
projected $24,517,598<span style="color: black"> </span>in administrative costs 
for calendar year 2007 that were actuarially supported and reasonably and 
equitably reflected revenue requirements in accordance with Federal 
regulations.&nbsp; Therefore, we did not make any recommendations.</p>
