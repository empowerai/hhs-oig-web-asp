<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report provides the results of our audit of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
  Superfund Financial Activities for Fiscal Year (FY) 1992. Our audit disclosed that NIEHS generally administered the fund
  according to Superfund legislation with the exception that NIEHS still does not have procedures to ensure that all Superfund
  grantees had obtained independent audits. As a result, the National Institutes of Health and NIEHS were not aware whether
  audit requirements were being met. Further, they were not aware whether sanctions needed to be taken for grantees who had
  not submitted audit reports. We are recommending that the Public Health Service direct NIH to: (1) establish procedures
  to ensure that all Superfund grantees submit audit reports; and (2) sanction grantees who are unwilling to have a proper
  audit conducted. </p>
