<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the Alabama Medicaid Agency (AMA) had established adequate accountability
  and internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program.</p>
<p>AMA generally followed adequate accounting procedures and had controls over the drug rebate program as required by Federal
  rules and regulations.&nbsp; However, we noted AMA did not:&nbsp; (1) account for the collection of interest as required
  by rebate agreements between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the drug manufacturers or (2) establish
  write-off criteria for dispute resolution as required by Federal regulations.&nbsp; The weaknesses occurred because AMA
  had not established official written policies and procedures.&nbsp; AMA officials agreed with our finding on the collection
  of interest; however, they did not agree that official policies and procedures were needed.&nbsp; Also, AMA officials disagreed
  with our finding on dispute resolution.</p>
