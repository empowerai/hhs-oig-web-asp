<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the State of Florida had established adequate accountability and
  internal controls over the Medicaid drug rebate program. &nbsp;The audit covered Medicaid drug rebates through June 30,
  2002.&nbsp; The review showed that the State has the opportunity to increase the amount of revenue that is realized from
  drug rebates, and follow the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services's (CMS) guidelines in the collection process.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the State the make it a priority to program the existing computer system to calculate interest and verify
  that interest payments are accurate and develop policies and procedures that establish write-off criteria for dispute resolution.&nbsp; State
  officials concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
