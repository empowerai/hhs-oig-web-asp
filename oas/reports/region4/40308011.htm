<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our audit was to determine whether CDC had complied with applicable
  laws, regulations, and departmental policies in managing its HIV/AIDS prevention grants.&nbsp; During
  fiscal years 1999 through 2003, CDC’s management of HIV/AIDS prevention grants did not always comply.
  These conditions existed because the guidance CDC management provided to its employees in the “CDC
  Assistance Management Manual” was not always consistent with relevant laws, regulations and departmental
  policies.&nbsp; Subsequent to our fieldwork, CDC officials rescinded its interim approval of this manual.&nbsp; We
  recommended that CDC continue to monitor its grants management operations to ensure full compliance
  with relevant laws, regulations, and departmental policies.&nbsp; In response to our report, CDC concurred
  with our recommendation, but pointed out that competing priorities and limited resources made it difficult
  to better document all facets of its operations.</p>
