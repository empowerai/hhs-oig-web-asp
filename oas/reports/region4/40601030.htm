<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The audit is one of several reviews of procurements by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) provide, among other things, that HHS agencies award each contract to a responsible party and document compliance with requirements for full and open competition and the determination that the price was fair and reasonable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the hurricanes, CDC&rsquo;s Procurement and Grants Office modified an existing satellite telephone service contract with Thrane and Thrane, Inc. (Thrane).&nbsp;Our objective was to determine whether CDC complied with FAR and HHSAR requirements during the award process involving Thrane.&nbsp;CDC complied with the requirements.</p>
