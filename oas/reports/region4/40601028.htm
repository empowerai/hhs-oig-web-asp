<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>As part of the Inspector General's broad evaluation of procurements by departmental components
  during relief operations following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we audited selected procurements
  under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contract 200-2005-11532 with GlaxoSmithKline
  (GSK).&nbsp; Our objectives were to determine whether CDC complied with the Federal Acquisition
  Regulation (FAR) while making the involved procurements and accurately computed amounts&nbsp;charged
  to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) based on the actual costs incurred.&nbsp; We
  found that CDC complied with applicable parts of the FAR while issuing two delivery orders
  to GSK for emergency shipments of vaccines to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals
  and the Mississippi Department of Health, and that CDC's claims for reimbursement from FEMA
  accurately reflected the actual costs incurred.</p>
