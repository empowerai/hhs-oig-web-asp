<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Georgia Department of Human Resources (Georgia) generally accounted for program
  funds ($27.1 million received as of April 30, 2003 for the 4-year period ending August 30, 2003) in accordance with the
  terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and applicable
  departmental regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; Specifically, Georgia recorded, summarized and reported transactions by
  specific focus area.&nbsp; When Georgia contracts with sub-recipients, it has monitoring procedures in place.&nbsp; In
  addition, Georgia is developing a site visit component.&nbsp; Further, Georgia officials indicated that CDC funding had
  not been used to supplant programs previously funded by other organizational sources.&nbsp; We recommended Georgia implement
  sub-recipient monitoring when contracts are awarded, and address problem areas, as they are identified.&nbsp; Georgia concurred
  with our findings and recommendation and is taking corrective actions to improve its bioterrorism grant program.</p>
