<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period April 1, 2006, through March 31, 2007, Ohio 
made some Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) basic assistance 
payments that did not meet Federal and State requirements and did not adequately 
document all eligibility and payment determinations. &nbsp;TANF is a block grant 
program that provides funding to States to help families move from welfare to 
self-sufficiency; TANF’s basic assistance includes benefits designed to meet a 
family’s ongoing basic needs. &nbsp;This review, part of an eight-State series, was 
requested by the Administration for Children and Families and the Office of 
Management and Budget for determining the fiscal year 2008 national TANF error 
rate.&nbsp; Pursuant to the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 
107-300), Federal agencies must estimate and report to Congress on the annual 
amount of improper payments in their high-risk programs. <br>
<br>
Based on our sample results, we estimated that the overall TANF improper payment 
rate was 21.1 percent of the Federal dollars expended and 20 percent of the 
number of basic assistance payments made for the 1-year audit period. &nbsp;These 
improper payments totaled an estimated $44.1 million (Federal share).&nbsp; The 
payments were improper because they were for families who were ineligible for 
TANF basic assistance, were duplicated or improperly calculated, or lacked 
required documentation.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State (1) use the results of this review to help ensure 
compliance with Federal and State TANF requirements, (2) determine the current 
eligibility of all recipients identified in this review as improperly enrolled 
in the TANF program and ensure that further assistance is denied for those who 
remain ineligible, and (3) recalculate assistance budgets for all recipients 
identified in this review as having received improperly calculated payments.&nbsp; In 
its comments on our draft report, the State provided information on steps it had 
taken or planned to take to implement the recommendations.</p>
