<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine if the Alabama
  Department of Public Health &#8211; Complaint Unit (Survey Agency) properly
  investigates, tracks, and monitors physical and sexual abuse in nursing facilities
  in a timely manner.&nbsp; Our review revealed that changes should be made to
  improve the methodology currently used to investigate, track, and monitor physical
  and sexual abuse complaints as reported by nursing facilities.&nbsp; We recommend
  that the Survey Agency:&nbsp; (1) investigate complaints within established
  timeframes and notify CMS of all abuse complaint backlogs and request assistance
  from CMS to help restore the workload to a manageable level, (2) improve policies
  and procedures to include detailed instructions for tracking and monitoring
  all complaints received, (3) update the registry in accordance with Federal
  requirements and place a higher priority on abuse complaints that have already
  been substantiated by the nursing facilities, and (4) encourage nursing facilities
  and their employees to report abuse allegations in accordance with Federal
  and State regulations by citing the nursing facilities with deficiencies.</p>
