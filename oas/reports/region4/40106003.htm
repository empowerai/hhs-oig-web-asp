<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p >Overall, the Young Adult Guidance Center, Inc. (YAGC) met the goals of providing shelter and assistance to runaway and
  homeless youth.&nbsp; However, our review of the YAGC’s accounting controls revealed serious weaknesses.&nbsp; These weaknesses
  occurred because YAGC management had not established adequate accounting controls.&nbsp; As a result, charges to the Basic
  Center and other funding sources did not accurately reflect the actual expenses of these activities; YAGC funds totaling
  about $4,000 were stolen; YAGC was not aware that over $12,000 of Basic Center funds were available for program purposes;
  penalties and fines were assessed for late payments; vehicles were purchased without the Administration for Children and
  Families’ knowledge; YAGC management was reimbursed for questionable expenses; and facility rental rates the YAGC paid
  were higher than comparable rental rates for the area.&nbsp; We recommended several procedural changes to strengthen YAGC’s
  accounting controls.&nbsp; We also recommended that the YAGC evaluate its ability to properly control and account for Federal
  funds before submitting future Department of Health and Human Services grant proposals.&nbsp; YAGC officials generally
  agreed with our findings and recommendations and have prepared a plan of action to improve the Center’s accounting controls.</p>
