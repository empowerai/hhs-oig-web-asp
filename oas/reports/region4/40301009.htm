<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the North Carolina Division of Public Health
  (North Carolina) generally accounted for program funds ($25.1 million received
  for the 4-year period ending August 30, 2003) in accordance with the terms
  and conditions of the cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention (CDC) and applicable departmental regulations and guidelines.
  Specifically, North Carolina recorded, summarized and reported transactions
  by specific focus area.&nbsp; In addition, North Carolina’s monitoring procedures
  for contracts and its advanced accounting system facilitated the tracking and
  monitoring of subrecipient activities and expenditures.&nbsp; Further, North
  Carolina officials indicated that CDC funding had not been used to supplant
  programs previously funded by other organizational sources.&nbsp; We recommended
  North Carolina:&nbsp; (1) develop written policies and procedures for tracking
  the Program fund activities within the financial accounting system; and (2)
  implement plans to increase the coordination of monitoring activities for subrecipients
  of the Program.&nbsp; North Carolina concurred with our findings and recommendations
  and is taking corrective actions to improve its bioterrorism grant program.</p>
