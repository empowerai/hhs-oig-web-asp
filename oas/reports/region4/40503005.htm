<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The audit 
objectives to (1) determine whether Florida Urology Physicians, P.A. (the 
Practice) claimed reimbursement for pathology laboratory services in accordance 
with Medicare Part B requirements from September through December 2004 and (2) analyze the Practice's utilization and pattern for pathology services. &nbsp;The Practice’s claims for pathology laboratory services generally 
complied with Medicare Part B requirements.&nbsp; We noted an increase in the number 
of pathology services requested and performed after the Practice opened its own 
laboratory, which increased costs to the Medicare program.&nbsp; 
However, the Practice explained that the increased number 
of tissue examination requests were an attempt to more fully meet the needs of 
its patients. &nbsp;The audit report did not contain any recommendations for the 
Practice.</span></p>
