<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>Our objectives were to determine whether the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
  Services (the State):&nbsp; (1) recorded and reported HRSA Program funds awarded, expended,
  obligated, and unobligated in accordance with the cooperative agreement;&nbsp;(2) ensured
  that the Program funds were used for necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs
  in accordance with the terms of the cooperative agreement; and (3) supplanted current State
  or local funding with Program funds.</p>
<p>The State generally recorded and reported HRSA Program funds awarded, expended, obligated,
  and unobligated by priority area, by critical benchmark, and by funds allocated to hospitals
  and other health care entities as required by the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; Costs incurred
  by the State for administering the Program were necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable.&nbsp; However,
  the two subrecipients that we reviewed claimed reimbursement from the State for $227,666
  in unallowable costs.&nbsp; We found no evidence that the State supplanted State or local
  expenditures with Program funds.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) reduce Program expenditures by the $227,666 of
  unallowable subrecipient costs and increase unobligated funds by the same amount when preparing
  the final Financial Status Report; (2) implement adequate reporting and monitoring policies
  and procedures in a timely manner; and (3) develop award documents that clearly identify
  the type of award and related cost principles.&nbsp; The State generally disagreed with our
  findings and recommendations.&nbsp; The State agreed that $40,812 is unallowable and maintained
  that the balance of $186,854 is allowable.&nbsp; We continue to believe that $186,854 is
  unallowable.</p>
