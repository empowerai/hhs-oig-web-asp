<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our review showed that Palmetto’s:&nbsp; (1) accounting controls for generating a paid claims electronic file were generally
  adequate, and (2) monthly financial reconciliations were substantially accurate, supportable, and complete.&nbsp; However,
  we noted that the Multi-Carrier System is unable to generate a paid claims electronic file and this resulted in our being
  unable to reconcile total funds expended totaling approximately $1.7 million for Part B Ohio and West Virginia, and for
  the Railroad Retirement Board.</p>
