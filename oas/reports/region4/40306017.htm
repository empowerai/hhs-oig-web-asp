&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine whether Florida Health used the additional capitation payments in a manner
  consistent with the Benefits Improvement Protection Act (BIPA) requirements and (2) supported the modifications to the
  2001 proposal.&nbsp; About $1.2 million of the $6.9 million increase in Florida Health&#8217;s revised proposal was not
  used in a manner consistent with BIPA requirements or was not supported.&nbsp; We recommended that Florida Health refund
  $1,247,220 to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services or, as an alternative, deposit this amount in a benefit
  stabilization fund for use in future years.&nbsp; We also recommended that Florida Health ensure that estimated costs in
  future proposals are properly supported.&nbsp; Florida Health agreed with our recommendations. </p>
