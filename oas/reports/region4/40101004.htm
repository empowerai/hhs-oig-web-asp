<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report presents the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audit Services
  audit made to determine if the Georgia Medicaid Program was appropriately preventing providers that have been excluded
  from the Medicare and Medicaid programs by the OIG from being enrolled and paid by the Georgia Medicaid program.&nbsp; Our
  review indicated that the Georgia Medicaid Program made payments of $41,245 ($23,132 Federal share) to excluded providers
  during Calendar Year 1999.&nbsp; These improper payments occurred because the State did not have an adequate mechanism
  in place to prevent excluded providers from participating in the Medicaid program.&nbsp; We recommended that these improper
  payments be rebooked on the State&#146;s Quarterly Expenditure Report as recoveries, that the State take steps to prevent
  excluded providers from participating in the Georgia Medicaid program, and that the State terminate those excluded providers
  who are currently enrolled.</p>
