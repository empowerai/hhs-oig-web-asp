<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This review was made by the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts (State auditors) and was conducted as part of the Inspector
  General's partnership efforts with States to expand audit coverage of the Medicaid program. The State auditors' final report
  points out that the State Department for Medicaid Services did not have adequate procedures or controls to ensure that
  reimbursement for Medicaid clinical laboratory tests did not exceed amounts allowed by the Medicare program. As a result,
  the auditors estimated the Department for Medicaid Services made potential overpayments of about $2.3 million ($1.6 million
  Federal share) to providers during Calendar Years 1994-1996. In addition to procedural improvements, the State auditors
  recommended the Department for Medicaid Services pursue recovery of the $2.3 million in overpayments and make adjustments
  to the Federal share. The Department for Medicaid Services generally agreed with recommendations made by the State auditors.</p>
