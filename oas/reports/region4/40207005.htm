<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has no controls or edits to detect
  excessive payments to prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals for erroneously coded discharges that are followed by
  postacute care. As a result, we estimate, based on a statistical sample, that Medicare paid approximately $61 million in
  excessive diagnosis related groups (DRG) payments to PPS hospitals for fiscal year (FY) 2000. Combining this estimate with
  our estimate of $55 million in erroneous payments that were previously identified for FY 1999, we estimate that CMS has
  overpaid hospital claims by approximately $116 million for the initial 2-year period of the postacute care transfer policy.
  In addition to financial adjustments and identification of overpayments subsequent to FY 2000, we recommended that CMS,
  as a long term remedy, establish an alert mechanism within the Common Working File to compare applicable inpatient claims
  with subsequent postacute claims. This will allow potentially erroneous inpatient hospital claims to be detected, reviewed,
  and appropriately adjusted on an ongoing basis.</p>
