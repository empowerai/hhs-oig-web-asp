<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have no controls in place to prevent
  excessive payments to prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals for erroneously coded patient discharges that are followed
  by postacute care, such as care in a skilled nursing facility or by a home health agency. Medicare policy calls for inpatient
  payment rates to be reduced when PPS hospitals discharge beneficiaries in 10 specified diagnosis related groups (DRG) to
  such settings. However, we estimate, based on a statistical sample, that Medicare paid approximately $52.3 million nationwide
  in excessive DRG payments to PPS hospitals as a result of erroneously coded discharges. In addition to recovery of overpayments,
  we are recommending that HCFA, as a long-term remedy, establish edits in its Common Working File to compare beneficiary
  inpatient claims potentially subject to the postacute care policy with subsequent claims. This will allow potentially erroneous
  claims to be reviewed and appropriate adjustments to be made to the discharging hospital&#146;s inpatient claim.&nbsp; CMS
  officials concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
