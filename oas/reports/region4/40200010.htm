<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>At the request of the Department's Office of Community Services 
  (OCS), we performed a limited-scope review of the East Winston Community Development 
  Corporation's (EWCDC) administration of an OCS Economic Development Grant.&nbsp; 
  The purpose of the grant was to create a community-owned, cafeteria-style restaurant 
  known as the <i>EastSide Cafeteria</i> Project and to provide employment to 
  30 individuals in this community.&nbsp; Our final report points out that EWCDC 
  did not meet the grant objectives.&nbsp; Also, grant funds were not used to 
  renovate the proposed cafeteria site nor to purchase the equipment for the cafeteria's 
  operations as outlined in its OCS-approved grant.&nbsp; We recommended that 
  OCS recover the $250,000 of grant funds and that EWCDC evaluate its ability 
  to properly control and account for federal funds before submitting future Department 
  of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant proposals.&nbsp; The EWCDC officials 
  generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.&nbsp; Primarily, 
  the EWCDC officials did not agree that the expenditure of OCS grant funds was 
  restricted for use in renovating the proposed cafeteria site and purchasing 
  equipment for the cafeteria's operation.&nbsp; The EWCDC officials believe that 
  it was proper to expend the grant funds for any purpose that was related to 
  the overall cafeteria project.</p>
