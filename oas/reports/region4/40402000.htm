<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The final report consolidates results from our reviews of select agent security at 11 universities.&nbsp; In general,
  serious weaknesses that compromised the security of select agents existed at all 11 universities.&nbsp; Physical security
  weaknesses left select agents vulnerable to theft or loss, thus elevating the risk of public exposure.&nbsp; Inadequate
  inventory and recordkeeping procedures prevented us from concluding that the universities had complied with the select
  agent transfer requirements.&nbsp; At least half the universities had inadequate procedures for identifying persons barred
  from accessing select agents.&nbsp; Five universities that used information technology resources for select agent data
  exhibited control weaknesses that could compromise the security and integrity of the data.&nbsp; The OIG reports contained
  numerous recommendations for strengthening physical security, compliance with the select agent transfer requirements, controls
  over restricted person access, and information technology controls.&nbsp; In general, the universities agreed with the
  OIG recommendation and began implementing corrective actions.</p>
