<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up review of the North Carolina Medicaid drug 
rebate program, we found that the State agency had established controls over 
collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; 
Manufacturers may make their outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid 
funding by entering into a rebate agreement with the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services and paying quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp; The 
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required States, as of January 2006, to begin 
collecting rebates on single source drugs administered by physicians.&nbsp; This 
report offers no recommendations.</p>
