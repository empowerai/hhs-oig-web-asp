</font> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The objective of this audit </font> 
<span style="color:#000080">was t</span><font color="#000080">o 
determine whether the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) made 
Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) payments only on behalf of beneficiaries whose 
eligibility periods had not expired.&nbsp; We found that during the 3-year period 
end June 30, 2005, DCF made payments totaling at least $226,028 on behalf of 
beneficiaries whose eligibility periods had expired.&nbsp; In addition, DCF’s 
computerized eligibility system contained missing or inaccurate dates of entry 
or of asylum for some beneficiaries, allowing erroneous payments to occur. &nbsp;As a 
result, DCF made $58,510 in additional erroneous payments to 24 beneficiaries.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to certain procedural recommendations, we 
recommended that DCF make a financial adjustment of $226,028 for the RMA 
payments made on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries and a financial adjustment 
of $58,510 for 24 beneficiaries whose dates of entry or of asylum were not 
documented in the case files.&nbsp; DCF generally concurred with our 
recommendations.&nbsp; However, in its written comments, DCF did not address the 
eligibility of the 24 beneficiaries whose dates of entry or of asylum were not 
documented in the case files.&nbsp; Therefore, we continued to recommend that DCF 
repay $58,510 in overpayments applicable to these 24 beneficiaries.</font></p>
