<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the review was to evaluate the medical necessity of the care and services provided and the reasonableness
  of the charges and reimbursements made during the period from January 1994 through December 31, 1995. </p>
<p>The Operation Restore Trust reviewers questioned $391,719 in charges reported for the 32 beneficiaries in our sample.
  This amount comprises $312,363 related to physical, occupational, respiratory and speech therapy; $48,834 in unallowable
  laboratory charges, and $30,385 for drugs and other supplies. Therefore, we are recommending an adjustment of the above
  charges. In addition, we request that a focused review of occupational and respiratory therapies and the use of standing
  orders for all therapies be conducted by the Fiscal Intermediary and State agency in order to recoup overpayments made
  to this skilled nursing facility and to implement corrective action by the facility. </p>
