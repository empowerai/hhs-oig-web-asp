<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report presents the results of our review of the internal control structure over the accounts payable
  balance for the supplementary medical insurance trust fund at September 30, 1992. We identified problems with the design
  and implementation of the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) internal control structure and accounting policies
  used to report supplementary medical insurance trust fund accounts payable balances. The HCFA's financial reporting instructions
  to the carriers were too general causing accounts payable amounts to be calculated and reported inconsistently. Also, accounting
  policy issues need to be addressed because certain benefit payment checks and contracted services were improperly included
  in the accounts payable balance. Recommendations call for HCFA to take steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
  accounts payable balances. </p>
