<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the 94 high-dollar payments that Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Georgia, Inc. (BCBSG) made to Medicare Part A providers in calendar 
years 2004 and 2005, 12 totaling $264,000 were inappropriate. &nbsp;Eight 
overpayments totaling $209,000 had been refunded before the start of our 
fieldwork and four overpayments totaling $54,000 remained outstanding.&nbsp; BCBSG is 
a fiscal intermediary serving Medicare providers in Georgia.&nbsp; It had edits in 
place for high-dollar charges during our audit period, which contributed to the 
high number of appropriate payments it processed.&nbsp; However, BCBSG made some<span style="color:black">
</span>inappropriate payments because neither its system nor the common working 
file had sufficient edits in place during calendar years 2004 or 2005 to detect 
billing errors related to the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes 
and units of service.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that BCBSG<span class="address"><span style="font-weight: normal"> 
recover the $</span></span>54,000 in identified overpayments.&nbsp; BCBSG agreed with 
our findings.&nbsp; BCBSG stated it had recovered $13,000 of the identified 
overpayments and was in the process of recovering the remaining $42,000.</p>
