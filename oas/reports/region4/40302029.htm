<p>This report points out that overall, Kentucky&#8217;s inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and skilled nursing facility
  upper payment limit (UPL) payments were made within the terms of the approved State plan amendments.&nbsp; In addition,
  Kentucky&#8217;s methodologies for the UPL calculations were reasonable.&nbsp; However, some minor computational errors
  resulted in UPL overpayments of $75,748 (Federal share $52,926) associated with its inpatient hospital UPL calculations
  and $227,916 (Federal share $159,405) associated with its outpatient hospital UPL calculations.&nbsp; We recommended that
  Kentucky reimburse the Federal Government $212,331 for the Federal share of the overpayments.&nbsp; We also recommended
  that Kentucky improve procedures to review the UPL calculations for accuracy.</p>
