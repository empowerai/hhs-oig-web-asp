<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Sarasota Memorial Hospital (the hospital)
  complied with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its fiscal year (FY) 2003
  Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital did not fully comply with Medicare requirements
  for reporting wage data in its FY 2003 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital understated
  its wage data by $2,926,445 and 175,695 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the hospital (1) submit a revised FY 2003 Medicare cost report to the
  fiscal intermediary to correct the understatements in the wage data totaling $2,926,445 and
  175,695 hours and (2) implement review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage
  data reported on future Medicare cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in compliance
  with Medicare requirements.&nbsp; The hospital agreed with the findings and recommendations.</p>
