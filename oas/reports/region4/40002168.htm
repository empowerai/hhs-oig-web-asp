<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no statutory or regulatory authority governing allowability of costs in the revised ACR process. Using
  reasonable cost guidelines applicable to other areas of the Medicare program, we identified $13,107,786 in costs that could
  have been eliminated when computing the ACR if Federal Acquisition Regulations contract cost principles were applied to
  risk-based MCOs. The $13,107,786 included: $889,103 for such costs as travel and entertainment, alcoholic beverages, public
  relations, goodwill, contributions, unsupported costs, and costs that had no relation to the Medicare program; $531,542
  for public relations fees, radio and television announcements, video, printing, and courier services applicable to a private
  clinic not associated by ownership with the Plan; and $11,687,141 in excessive administrative costs allocated to Medicare
  as the result of the Plan using an unreasonable cost allocation methodology. </p>
<p>The effect of including these administrative costs in the Plan's ACRP was to increase the amounts needed for administration,
  thus reducing any potential &quot;excess&quot; from the Medicare payment amounts. In addition, this methodology impacts
  the amounts available to Medicare beneficiaries for additional benefits or reduced premiums. Using the resultant $67.86
  per member-per month rate reduction computed by eliminating these costs from the ACRP base year, we estimate that Medicare
  beneficiaries were adversely impacted in CY 2000 by about $13.8 million (based on the Plan's projected Medicare enrollment
  levels). The $13.8 million could have been used to eliminate the premiums and copayments the Plan charged during CY 2000
  or the Plan could have offered its enrolled Medicare beneficiaries additional benefits above those originally provided. </p>
<p>While this review examined only one plan, we believe that the review results of this plan, and others previously reviewed
  highlight a significant problem - administrative costs deemed unallowable under Medicare's reasonable cost principles are
  being paid with Medicare funds. We are continuing our reviews at other MCOs. The results of these reviews will be shared
  with HCFA in the coming months so that appropriate legislative changes can be considered. </p>
