<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare fee-for-service claims paid for services provided to incarcerated
  beneficiaries during the 3-year period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999 were in compliance with federal regulations
  and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.&nbsp; This review is part of a nationwide review requested
  by the Senate Finance Committee.&nbsp; We found that prisoner data from the Social Security Administration was not contained
  in CMS’s records; therefore, the Medicare fiscal intermediary and carrier in Florida did not have controls in place to
  detect claims submitted on behalf of incarcerated beneficiaries.&nbsp; Once CMS' common working file edit and modifier
  are initiated, corrective actions can be implemented.&nbsp; We will provide CMS, for their referral to the State, with
  specific examples of instances in which due diligence was not pursued and corrective actions may be necessary.</p>
