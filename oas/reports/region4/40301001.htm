<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if the Miami-Dade Eligible Metropolitan Area, managed by the Miami-Dade County
  Office of Management and Budget&#8217;s (Budget Office), ensured that its contractor, Minorities Overcoming the Virus through
  Education and Spirituality, Inc. (MOVERS), provided the expected program services and followed Federal requirements for
  charging costs.&nbsp; We found that the Budget Office did not ensure that MOVERS provided the expected level of services
  to CARE Act Title I eligible clients.&nbsp; In addition, MOVERS did not follow Federal requirements in charging costs to
  the program.&nbsp; As a result, the Budget Office reimbursed MOVERS $1,505,505 with little assurance that services were
  provided, as reported, to the HIV community, and that the reimbursement was based on allowable costs.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Budget Office improve its program and fiscal monitoring systems, conduct an in-depth review of MOVERS&#8217; billed
  services, and work with MOVERS to determine and review its actual costs for FY 2001.&nbsp; Both the Budget Office and MOVERS
  concurred with our findings and recommendations and both are taking corrective actions to improve their CARE Act Title
  I programs.</p>
