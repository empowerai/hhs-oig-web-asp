<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoSubtitle"><span style="font-weight: normal">During our review 
period, the Kentucky Division of Child Support (the State agency)</span>
<span style="font-weight: normal">did not recognize any undistributable child 
support collections, nor did it report any of them as program income</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal">.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-weight:normal">As of December 2005, the State agency 
had not recognized or reported program income totaling $2,681,571 ($1,769,837 
Federal share) for undistributable child support collections and interest income 
earned from uncashed State </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Department 
of Treasury (Treasury)</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> checks.<br>
<br>
</span>We recommended that the State agency (1) ensure that undistributable 
collections totaling $2,040,753 ($1,346,897 Federal share) are transferred to 
the State’s general fund or Treasury and reported as program income, (2) 
recognize and report program income totaling $640,818 ($422,940 Federal share) 
for interest earned from uncashed Treasury checks, (3) implement policies and 
procedures to ensure that uncashed checks and undistributed collections are 
transferred to Treasury and reported as program income, (4) implement policies 
and procedures to recognize and report as program income the interest earned 
from uncashed Treasury checks, and (5) recognize and report program income for 
collections that became eligible for forfeiture or abandonment and interest 
earned from uncashed Treasury checks subsequent to our audit period.&nbsp; The State 
agency concurred with our findings.</p>
