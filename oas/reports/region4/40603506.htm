<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">From 1998 to 2001, the State agency appropriately 
recognized and reported program income for undistributable child support 
collections.&nbsp; However, for 2002 through 2005, the State agency did not report 
program income totaling $360,286 ($237,789 Federal share) for undistributable 
collections that it had recognized as abandoned.&nbsp; State agency officials said 
that they did not report the undistributable collections as program income 
because their accounting personnel were not aware of the Federal reporting 
requirements.<br>
<br>
Except as discussed in the “Other Matter” section of our report, the State 
agency appropriately reported program income for interest earned on its child 
support collections.<br>
<br>
We recommend that the State agency (1) ensure that the $360,286 ($237,789 
Federal share) in undistributable child support collections previously reported 
on Federal Form OCSE-34A, “Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Report of 
Collections,” is reported as program income on the next quarterly Federal Form 
OCSE-396A, “Child Support Enforcement Program Financial Report,” and (2) provide 
guidance and training to its accounting personnel on how to accurately report 
undistributable child support collections recognized as abandoned on Form 
OCSE-34A as program income on Form OCSE-396A to offset program expenditures.&nbsp; 
The State agency concurred with our recommendations.</p>
