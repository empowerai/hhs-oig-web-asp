<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report, prepared by Ollie Green &amp; Company, certified public accountants, points out that Blue Cross
  and Blue Shield of Florida (Plan) claimed unallowable costs of about $14.7 million for administering the Medicare Part
  B program during the period October 1987 through September 1990. The unallowable costs consisted of; (1) costs of $11.7
  million incurred and claimed in excess of budgeted amounts, (2) questionable costs of $2.7 million for legal and settlement
  expenses as a result of a lawsuit filed by an unsuccessful bidder, and (3) other unallowable costs totaling $0.2 million.
  We recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements. </p>
