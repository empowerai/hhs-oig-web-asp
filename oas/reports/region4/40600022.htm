<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the Georgia 
Department of Community Health (the Medicaid agency) claimed costs for targeted 
case management (TCM) services for individuals deemed at risk of incarceration, 
in compliance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; Based on our sample results, 
we estimate that during Federal fiscal years (FY) 2003 and 2004, the Medicaid 
agency claimed $4,654,984 ($2,835,507 Federal share) in TCM costs for services 
not in compliance with Federal and State requirements.&nbsp; The Medicaid agency 
inappropriately claimed Federal financial participation (FFP) for unallowable services provided by the Georgia Department of 
Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because neither the Medicaid agency nor DJJ had adequate 
controls to ensure that the services claimed were eligible for FFP.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the Medicaid agency refund to the Federal Government the 
$2,835,507 estimated overpayment for Federal FYs&nbsp;2003 and 2004, examine claims 
made during the period subsequent to our audit for compliance with these 
requirements and refund any overpayments identified, and establish monitoring 
procedures to provide reasonable assurance that DJJ complies with Federal and 
State requirements in submitting TCM claims.&nbsp; The Medicaid agency stated that it 
would refund the Federal share once a final determination has been made as to 
the overpayment for Federal FYs 2003 and 2004 and that it would comply with our 
second and third recommendations.</p>
