<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our audit showed that Parkway did not meet Medicare cost guidelines in two areas:&nbsp; documenting the reasonable cost
  of the management fees, and claiming rental costs not related to patient care.&nbsp; Parkway did not maintain records to
  demonstrate that it carried out its fiduciary responsibilities to ensure costs are reasonable as outlined in the Medicare
  cost guidelines.&nbsp; As a result, we cannot render an opinion as to the reasonableness of the nearly $8.9 million the
  Medicare program reimbursed Parkway for the outpatient oncology clinic.&nbsp; Our audit also showed that Parkway claimed
  rental charges on the 1999 Medicare cost report that were not related to patient care.&nbsp; We estimate Medicare overpaid
  Parkway about $52,000 .&nbsp; We are recommending that Parkway:&nbsp; (1) strengthen its procedures to ensure that Parkway
  record its justifications for future management support service agreements and to have that documentation available for
  review; and (2) remove unallowable rental charges from the cost report for the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 1999.</p>
