<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the allowability of Title IV-E training costs the State agency
  claimed for the period April 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003.&nbsp; The State agency did
  not always follow Federal regulations regarding allowability of Eastern Kentucky University
  (EKU) and other Title IV-E training costs.&nbsp; These deficiencies occurred because the
  State agency:&nbsp; (1) was not always aware of Title IV-E laws, regulations, and program
  policies and (2) did not have adequate procedures to ensure that it claimed only eligible
  training costs.</p>
<p> We recommended the State agency:&nbsp; (1) reduce reported Federal reimbursement by $1,063,743
  (Federal share) for training courses provided by EKU, (2) work with the Administration for
  Children and Families (ACF) to determine the allowable portion of&nbsp; $9.7 million (Federal
  share) in both EKU training costs ($2.6 million) and State agency employee salaries and fringe
  benefits ($7.1 million) allocated to the Title IV-E program and (3) develop additional procedures.&nbsp; State
  agency officials agreed to return $484,910 of the $1,063,743 (Federal share), work with ACF
  to determine the allowable portion of costs we set aside, and implement and maintain additional
  procedures.</p>
