<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides for a lower payment for home health services
  rendered to beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital within 14 days immediately preceding admission to home
  health care.&nbsp; Based on a statistically valid sample, we estimate overpayments of approximately $10 million to home
  health agencies (HHAs) were made by Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators (Palmetto) for fiscal year 2001 for claims
  that did not meet this 14-day requirement.&nbsp; These overpayments occurred because HHAs did not provide the necessary
  or correct information to Palmetto, and Palmetto had not established adequate postpayment controls to detect HHA claims
  that were billed incorrectly.&nbsp; In addition to financial adjustments, we recommended that Palmetto provide education
  to HHAs to ensure that beneficiary discharge data is completed accurately on patient assessment instruments.</p>
