<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report presents the results of an Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audit Services, review of duplicate
  Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) payments at Capital Health Plan (CHP).&nbsp; Our review indicated that Medicare FFS made
  $30,283 in erroneous payments by paying for services that were claimed on CHP&#146;s 1999 cost report and that were also
  billed directly to Medicare.&nbsp; Because Medicare paid physicians directly for these services, and reimbursed CHP for
  its expenses related to paying for the services, Medicare has paid twice for the same services.&nbsp; The OIG recommends
  that CHP refund the $30,283 in overpayments made on behalf of CHP enrollees.</p>
