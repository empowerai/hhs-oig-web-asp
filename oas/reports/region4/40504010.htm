<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the State agency 
allowed durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers to remain in the Medicaid 
program after their Medicare supplier numbers had been revoked.&nbsp; The State agency took no action against eight suppliers who violated Federal 
standards and had their Medicare numbers revoked.&nbsp; Of the eight suppliers that 
we identified, the State agency paid $2,084,390 (Federal share $1,459,073) to 
four suppliers after their Medicare supplier numbers were revoked.&nbsp; The other 
four suppliers had not billed for any DME, even though they maintained active 
Medicaid supplier numbers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended the State agency revise the DME enrollment and 
renewal process to include verifying the validity of an applicant’s Medicare DME 
supplier number and consider suspending or terminating Medicaid DME suppliers 
who have had their Medicare supplier numbers revoked.&nbsp; The State said that 
it would take our findings and recommendations under advisement.</p>
