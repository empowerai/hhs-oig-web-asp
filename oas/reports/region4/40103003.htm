<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to:&nbsp; (1) determine the amount of non-tax delinquent debt owed to Medicare that
  existed at September 30, 2000; and (2) assess the collectibility of the delinquent debt at the contractor level for the
  same period.&nbsp; The accounts receivable balances Palmetto Government Benefit Administrators (PGBA) reported to the Centers
  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for financial statement purposes for the period ending September 30, 2000 for Part
  A (non-Medicare Secondary Payor (MSP) and MSP) accounts receivable was $1,280,443,717.&nbsp; We reconciled the subsidiary
  accounts for Part A to the general account.&nbsp; Other audit tests we performed on statistical samples of Part A non-MSP
  balances showed the vast majority of receivables were recorded, supported, complete, properly valued and existed at September
  30, 2000.&nbsp; However, we did recommend that the contractor reduce five Part A balances totaling over $10 thousand that
  were either not adequately supported or had improperly applied payments.&nbsp; PGBA officials concurred with th e recommendations
  and agreed to take corrective action to reduce the accounts receivable balance we identified in the report.</p>
