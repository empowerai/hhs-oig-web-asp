<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if Methodist Hospital’s (Hospital) claim for Medicare disproportionate share
  hospital (DSH) reimbursement was in compliance with Medicare reimbursement criteria.&nbsp; The hospital claimed $22,059,968
  in Medicare DSH reimbursement.&nbsp; Our review focused on the Medicaid eligible days and the Supplemental Security Income
  (SSI) ratio used by the hospital to support its claim.&nbsp; We found that the Hospital’s Medicare DSH claim included $3,057,727
  that was unsupported and/or otherwise unallowable.&nbsp; The unallowable claim occurred because the Hospital overstated
  the Medicaid eligible days and the supplemental security income ratio used in its revised DSH calculation.&nbsp; We found
  9,522 of the 67,068 Medicaid eligible days included in the Hospital’s claim to be either unsupported or non-allowable.&nbsp; The
  Hospital’s SSI ratio was incorrect because the Hospital improperly combined two SSI ratios in its DSH calculation.&nbsp; The
  Hospital used a blended SSI ratio of 15.62 percent, while the correct ratio for FY 1999 was 15.335 percent.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Hospital reduce the amount claimed for Medicare DSH by $3,057,727.&nbsp; We also recommended that the Hospital
  improve its procedures for verifying Medicaid eligibility.</p>
