<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if the costs CIGNA claimed on its Final Administrative Cost Proposals for
  administering the Medicare Part B and DMERC contracts for the period October 1, 1995 through September 30, 2001 were reasonable,
  allocable, and allowable for Medicare reimbursement.&nbsp; We concluded that $370,602 of direct costs were unallowable
  and $30,690,542 of indirect costs were considered unsupported and set aside for adjudication by the Centers for Medicare
  and Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp; We recommended financial adjustments and procedural improvements.</p>
