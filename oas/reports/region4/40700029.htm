<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For fiscal year 2006, Kindred Hospital South Florida’s 
(Kindred) average Medicare inpatient length of stay exceeded 25 days.&nbsp; Thus, 
Kindred complied with Federal regulations governing average length of stay, and 
its classification as a long-term care hospital (LTCH) was proper.&nbsp; Hospitals 
classified as LTCHs must have an average Medicare inpatient length of stay of 
greater than 25 days, which includes all Medicare covered and noncovered days 
and omits all Medicare leave and pass days. &nbsp;However, hospitals that were 
excluded from the prospective payment system in 1986 were subject to a different 
length of stay requirement.&nbsp; These hospitals must have an average inpatient 
length-of-stay for all patients of greater than 20 days.&nbsp; Kindred was subject to 
the 25 day average length-of-stay requirement.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services, which administers the Medicare program, directed the Medicare 
fiscal intermediaries to verify that LTCHs complied with Federal requirements.</p>
<p class="CM29" style="line-height: normal; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric ideograph-other">
Because Kindred complied with Federal regulations, we are 
not offering any recommendations.</p>
