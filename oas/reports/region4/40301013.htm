<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if the Miami-Dade Eligible Metropolitan Area, managed by
  the Miami-Dade County Office of Management and Budget&#8217;s (Budget Office), ensured that its contractor, South Shore
  Hospital and Medical Center (South Shore), provided the expected program services and followed Federal requirements for
  charging costs.&nbsp; The Budget Office did not ensure that South Shore complied with Federal cost principles in managing
  its contract.&nbsp; This occurred because the Budget Office did not provide appropriate fiscal monitoring, and South Shore&#8217;s
  accounting records did not support the costs reported to the Budget Office.&nbsp; As a result, the Budget Office had little
  assurance that the $936,285 reimbursed to South Shore was used as intended to serve HIV/AIDS clients.&nbsp; We recommended
  that the Budget Office improve its fiscal monitoring system and ensure South Shore implement accounting procedures and
  a time and effort reporting system to properly record CARE Act Title I costs.&nbsp; In addition, the Budget Office should
  work with South Shore to determine its CARE Act Title I costs for fiscal year 2001 to the present, and request that South
  Shore refund $8,300 it overstated in the final cost report.&nbsp; Both the Budget Office and South Shore generally concurred
  with our findings and recommendations and both are taking corrective actions to improve their CARE Act Title I programs.</p>
