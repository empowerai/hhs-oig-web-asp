<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that for the year ended September 30, 1997, Medicare fiscal intermediaries (FI) paid community
  mental health centers (CMHC) in five States $229 million (about 91 percent of the total amount paid of $252 million) for
  unallowable or otherwise highly questionable partial hospitalization program (PHP) services. The services were unallowable
  or questionable because: (1) beneficiaries were ineligible for PHP services; (2) the services were not reasonable and necessary
  for the patient's condition; (3) the services were not properly authorized by or furnished under the general supervision
  of a physician; and (4) services were not documented or were inadequately documented. Among other things, we recommended
  the recovery of improper payments, and that the Health Care Financing Administration take strong action against those facilities
  which did not meet the requirements to be CMHCs , including termination of provider agreements, where appropriate. The
  HCFA concurred with our recommendations. </p>
