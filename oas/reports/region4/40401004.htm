<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether costs recorded by the National Institute of Environmental
  Health Sciences (NIEHS) were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; We
  found that the NIEHS Superfund costs recorded for the audit period were allowable, allocable, and reasonable.&nbsp; We
  also determined that NIEHS took appropriate action to ensure that its Superfund grantees submit required audit reports.&nbsp; This
  report contained no recommendations.</p>
