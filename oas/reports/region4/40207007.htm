<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this review were to determine the appropriateness of Medicaid 
  fee-for-service payments made on behalf of dually eligible beneficiaries enrolled 
  in Medicare health maintenance organizations (HMO) and to ensure that services 
  purchased from Medicare HMOs through capitation payments were not also paid 
  by Medicaid through a capitation payment.&nbsp; We found that the Florida Agency 
  for Health Care Administration&nbsp;(FL-AHCA) made fee-for-service payments 
  that were the responsibility of Medicare HMOs.&nbsp; In addition, capitation 
  payments were made to both Medicare and Medicaid HMOs on behalf of the same 
  beneficiary.&nbsp; This occurred because the Florida Medicaid Management Information 
  System was not updated to reflect the enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in 
  Medicare HMOs. &nbsp;As a result, FL-AHCA made over $3.9 million in improper 
  payments during our audit period ($2.2 million federal share).</p>
