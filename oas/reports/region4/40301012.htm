<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Georgia Department of Human Resources (Georgia) generally accounted for program
  funds&nbsp; ($3.4 million received for the 2-year period ending March 31, 2004) in accordance with the terms and conditions
  of the cooperative agreement with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and applicable departmental regulations
  and guidelines.&nbsp; Georgia did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase, or by priority area in its accounting
  system.&nbsp; Although segregation was not required, budget restrictions were specified in the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; Georgia
  officials acknowledged the importance of tracking expenditures in order to comply with the budget restrictions.&nbsp; In
  addition, Georgia’s sub-recipients must submit reports on their activities and expenditures.&nbsp; Although Georgia officials
  had not completed any site visits to sub-recipients, it was in the process of developing a site visit component.&nbsp; Further,
  Georgia officials stated that HRSA funding had not been used to supplant programs previously provided by other organizational
  sources.&nbsp; We recommended Georgia make changes to its accounting system to segregate expenditures by phase and priority
  area; and, implement the site visit component and address problem areas as they are identified.&nbsp; Georgia concurred
  with our findings and recommendations and stated it would take the necessary steps to fully comply with the HRSA grant
  guidelines.</p>
