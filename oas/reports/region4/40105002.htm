<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our review, performed in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Audits, identified improper laboratory service payments
  of $1,762,835 (Federal share $1,072,639) by the Georgia Department of Community Health for the period October 1, 1996 through
  June 30, 1999.&nbsp; The overpayments resulted from inadequate edits and audits in the claims processing system.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the State adjust the HCFA-64 report for the Federal portion of the overpayments, initiate recovery from
  providers for the full overpayment amounts and correct the deficiencies in their claims processing system. </p>
