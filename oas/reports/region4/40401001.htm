<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether costs claimed for reimbursement for the 4 years ended September 30,
  2003 were allowable under terms of the contract and Federal regulations.&nbsp; Our audit showed that the contract was charged
  for costs that were neither allowable nor reasonable, including:&nbsp; salaries, wages and fringe benefits of employees
  who did not actually work on the project; equipment that was not and would not ever be used for project operations; and
  payments to firms with business relationships to the Co-Principal Investigator, even though the services were either not
  rendered or were not related to project operations.&nbsp; Of the $4,070,528 claimed for reimbursement, we recommend $565,820
  for financial adjustment and set aside $1,786,568 for adjudication.&nbsp; The University has initiated a number of significant
  actions to enhance their internal and management controls over federally funded projects and will negotiate a settlement
  of our financial recommendations with the National Library of Medicine.</p>
