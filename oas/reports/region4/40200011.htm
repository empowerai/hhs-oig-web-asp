<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that North Carolina claimed Federal reimbursement for unfunded retirement
  contributions totaling $127.4 million ($7.8 million Federal share).&nbsp; Under Federal cost principles, States are not
  entitled to seek reimbursement from the Federal Government for pension costs until such costs are funded.&nbsp; In a related
  matter, we noted that the North Carolina retirement fund’s assets exceeded actuarial liabilities by $4.4 billion ($315
  million Federal share) as of December 31, 2001.&nbsp; North Carolina had taken steps to address the actuarial surplus,
  reducing future employer contribution rates, granting cost-of-living increases to retirees, and reducing the assumed return
  on investment rates.&nbsp; However, the actuarial surplus continues.&nbsp; Therefore, North Carolina should continue its
  efforts to address the surplus and periodically reassess the contribution rates to ensure actuarial balance.&nbsp; We recommended
  that North Carolina refund the $7.8 million to the Federal Government.</p>
