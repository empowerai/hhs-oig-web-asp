<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare payments to Lifeline for home health
  services met Medicare eligibility and reimbursement requirements.&nbsp; Based on a statistical sample, we estimate that
  Lifeline was paid about $1.2 million for home health services that did not meet Medicare eligibility and reimbursement
  requirements.&nbsp; Lifeline billed for:&nbsp; beneficiaries who were either not homebound or whose homebound status was
  not adequately documented; beneficiaries who had no need for qualifying skilled services; services that were not reasonable
  or necessary for the beneficiary’s condition; services not properly authorized by a physician; and services not supported
  by documentation.&nbsp; We recommended that Lifeline:&nbsp; (1) examine the errors identified and develop additional admission
  controls, financial controls, and training to ensure that these types of errors do not occur in the future, and (2) work
  with the fiscal intermediary to reimburse the Medicare program the estimated overpayment of $1.2 million.</p>
