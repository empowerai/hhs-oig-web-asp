<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The objectives of this audit were to:&nbsp; (1) determine the amount
    of non-tax delinquent debt owed to Medicare that existed at September 30, 2000; and (2) assess the collectibility of
    the delinquent debt at the contractor level for the same period.&nbsp; The accounts receivable balances First Coast Service
    Options, Inc., (FCSO) reported to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for financial statement purposes
    for the period ending September 30, 2000 for Part A (non-Medicare Secondary Payor (MSP) and MSP) accounts receivable
    was $309,333,980 and the balance for Part B (non-MSP and MSP) was $129,570,480.&nbsp; Our reconciliation of the subsidiary
    accounts to the general account showed the Part B non-MSP was overstated over $9 million.&nbsp; Other audit tests we
    performed on statistical samples of Part A non-MSP and Part B non-MSP balances showed the vast majority of receivables
    were recorded, supported, complete, properly valued and existed at September 30, 2000.&nbsp; However, we did recommend
    that the contractor:&nbsp; (1) reduce four Part A balances totaling over $33 thousand and two Part B balances totaling
    over $144 thousand; (2) correct status codes on seven Part A and one Part B balances to show the accurate location of
    the balances; and (3) establish a system of internal control that will provide adequate and timely tracking of its collection
    activities.&nbsp; </span>Contractor officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
