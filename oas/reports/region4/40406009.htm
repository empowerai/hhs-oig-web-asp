<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether Ohio State University Hospital (the Hospital) included
  the appropriate number of dental residents in its full-time equivalent (FTE) counts when
  computing Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments for fiscal years (FYs) 2000
  through 2002. &nbsp;The Hospital inappropriately included a total of 75.04 direct GME FTEs
  and 92.29 indirect GME FTEs in the counts for FYs 2000 through 2002 without incurring all
  of the costs of training dental residents in nonhospital sites for those years.&nbsp; As
  a result, the Hospital overstated its direct and indirect GME claims by a total of $3.5 million
  for FYs 2000 through 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended:&nbsp; that the Hospital file an amended cost report that will result in
  a refund of $3,524,633; that the Hospital establish and follow written procedures to ensure
  that the FTE counts for residents in nonhospital settings include only those FTEs for which
  the Hospital has incurred all or substantially all of the training costs; and that the Hospital
  determine whether errors similar to those identified in our review occurred in Medicare cost
  reports after FY 2002 and refund any overpayments.&nbsp; The Hospital generally disagreed
  with our findings and recommendations.</p>
