<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">In a follow-up audit of Tennessee’s Medicaid drug rebate 
program, we found that as of June 30, 2006, the State had implemented the 
recommendations from our prior audit that related to verifying all amounts 
reported on the Form CMS 64.9R to ensure that those amounts tie directly back to 
the amounts recorded in the accounting records.&nbsp; Manufacturers may make their 
outpatient drugs eligible for Federal Medicaid funding by entering into a rebate 
agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and paying 
quarterly rebates to the States.&nbsp; We also found that the State had established 
controls over collecting rebates on single-source drugs administered by 
physicians. &nbsp;Therefore, we did not offer any recommendations.</p>
