<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<h1><span style="font-weight: normal">F</span><span style="font-weight: normal">or 
the quarters ended June 2004 through March 2007, t</span><span style="font-weight: normal">he 
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical 
Assistance, did not claim Federal share for Medicare Part B premiums that it 
paid on behalf of some Medicaid beneficiaries (buy-in) in accordance with 
Federal requirements. &nbsp;The Social Security Act allows States to use Medicaid 
funds to pay Medicare Part B premiums on behalf of certain persons eligible for 
both Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Of the
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">$722&nbsp;million that the State claimed,</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> 
$698 million was eligible for Federal share, and approximately $24 million 
(approximately $16 million </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Federal 
share)</span> <span style="font-weight: normal">was</span>
<span style="font-weight: normal">for beneficiaries in buy-in eligibility 
categories that were ineligible for Federal share.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We recommended that the State (1) refund 
to the Federal Government the $16 million incorrectly claimed for Federal share 
for Part B premiums, (2) perform a review of claims after the end of our audit 
period and refund any unallowable Federal share, and (3) develop adequate 
internal controls to ensure that Part B premiums claimed for Federal share are 
only for beneficiaries in eligible categories.&nbsp; The State concurred with our 
finding and recommendations.</span></h1>
