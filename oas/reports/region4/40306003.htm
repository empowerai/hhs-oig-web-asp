<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This review was part of a multistate audit.&nbsp; Our objective was to determine whether the State reported Medicaid provider reclaiming adjustments and overpayment adjustments in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; We found that 41 of 42 reclaiming adjustments that we reviewed, totaling $57 million ($31.9 million Federal share), were not reported in accordance with Federal requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, the State did not report 43 overpayment adjustments, totaling $25.7 million ($14.5 million Federal share), within 60 days of discovery).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) refund to the Federal Government $14.5 million, representing the outstanding balance of the $57 million ($31.9 million Federal share) in improper reclaiming adjustments; (2) establish and implement procedures to ensure that improper reclaiming adjustments are not included on the CMS-64; (3) provide training to staff; (4) centralize collection activity and add staff; (5) ensure that future overpayments are reported timely; and (6) identify overpayments that were handled incorrectly following the audit period and refund any money due to the Federal Government.&nbsp; In response, the State generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
