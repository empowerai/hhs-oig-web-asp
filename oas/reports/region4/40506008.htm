<p>The objective of our review
    was to determine whether Vista Healthplan of South Florida, Inc.’s (Vista’s) use of its
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increase was
    adequately supported and allowable.&nbsp; Vista submitted a revised proposal for contract
    year 2004 that reflected an increase of $10.7 million in Medicare capitation payments that
    were provided by the MMA legislation.&nbsp; Vista appropriately used the MMA payment increase
    to stabilize and enhance beneficiary access to providers through increased provider payments.&nbsp; The
    increased payments resulted when Vista revised many provider contracts to include higher
    compensation percentages.&nbsp; Vista’s increased provider payments were adequately supported
    and allowable.&nbsp; Therefore, we did not make any recommendations.</p>
