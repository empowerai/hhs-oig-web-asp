<p> <strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>This final report points out that for the period July 1, 1993 through March 31, 2000, the State did not adhere to Federal
  regulations concerning Medicaid escheated warrants.&nbsp; Specifically, the State:&nbsp; (1) could not identify the amount
  and timeliness of escheated warrants credited during the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994; (2) did not report
  any escheated warrants and as a result, drew down $4.4 million ($2.5 million Federal share) of Medicaid funds in excess
  of immediate program needs during the period July 1, 1994 through September 30, 1996; and (3) untimely credited $11.3 million
  ($6.3 million Federal share) of escheated warrants during the period October 1, 1996 through March 31, 2000.&nbsp; The
  Medicaid funds drawn in excess of immediate program needs were subsequently credited to the Federal Government.&nbsp; However,
  the State earned about $2 million&nbsp; ($1.1 million Federal share) in interest on the $11.3 million.&nbsp; Our analysis
  showed that the State repaid only $493,922 of the $1.1 million using its methodology for computing interest under the Cash
  Management and Improvement Act, leaving $613,891 due the Medicaid program.&nbsp; Along with procedural recommendations,
  we recommended that the State refund the $613,891.</p>
