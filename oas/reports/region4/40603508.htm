<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">The Florida Department of Revenue, Child Support 
Enforcement Program agency (the State agency) generally reported program income 
for undistributable child support collections in accordance with Federal 
requirements.&nbsp; In Florida, child support collections are not subject to the 
State’s abandoned property laws.&nbsp; Instead, the State agency has to determine the 
collections to be undistributable or unidentifiable before processing them as 
program income.&nbsp; From 1982 through 2005, the State agency accumulated about $31 
million in child support collections. <a name="OLE_LINK19">&nbsp;</a>During our audit 
period (October 1998 through 2005), the State agency reported only $1.4 million 
as program income as a result of an Office of Child Support Enforcement audit.&nbsp; 
In 2001 and 2002, the State agency improperly reversed $696,802 ($459,889 
Federal share) of the program income related to outstanding checks.&nbsp; These funds 
represented checks that were not exempt from the State’s abandoned property 
laws.<br>
<br>
We found that the accumulation of collections was possible, despite the State 
agency’s compliance with Federal requirements, because of (1) the State’s 
exemption of outstanding checks derived from child support collections from its 
abandoned property laws, (2) the State agency’s significant delay in 
establishing a rule for determining when collections are considered 
undistributable, and (3) the lack of a policy to deal with child support checks 
that are characterized as distributed but remain uncashed indefinitely.<br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) report program income for outstanding 
checks totaling $696,802 ($459,889 Federal share) that was incorrectly reversed 
and transfer this amount back to the State’s General Fund and (2) develop a 
rule, as directed by Florida statutes, defining when a collection is deemed 
undistributable.&nbsp; The State agency disagreed with our first recommendation but 
agreed with our second recommendation.&nbsp; </p>
