<p style="margin-top:10px;">Did you know that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the largest grant-making organization in the Federal Government? In fiscal year (FY) 2011 alone, HHS awarded over 82,000 grants totaling approximately $385 billion.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Through its Global HIV/AIDS Program, CDC implemented the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), working with ministries of health and other in-country partners to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health systems and building sustainable HIV/AIDS programs in more than 75 countries.  CDC's office in Windhoek, Namibia (CDC Namibia), is responsible for PEPFAR funds awarded to government agencies and for-profit and nonprofit organizations (recipients) in Namibia.  </p>

<p>Our audit found that CDC Namibia did not always monitor recipients' use of PEPFAR funds in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements.  There was evidence that CDC Namibia performed some monitoring of recipients' use of PEPFAR funds.  However, most of the recipient cooperative agreement files did not include required documents or evidence that CDC Namibia had monitored all cooperative agreements.  CDC Namibia did not consistently monitor the cooperative agreements in accordance with HHS and other Federal requirements because it did not have written policies and procedures for the monitoring process.  As a result, CDC Namibia did not have assurance that PEPFAR funds were used as intended by law.  </p>

<p>We recommended that CDC Namibia implement standard operating procedures for monitoring recipients' use of PEPFAR funds.  CDC concurred with our recommendation.  </p>
