<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to evaluate the reasonableness and allowability of costs claimed for reimbursement by
  the contractor on its final administrative cost proposals for the period October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1998.&nbsp; We
  identified $5,158,255 of unallowable charges to the Medicare program and set aside $104,836,580 for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
  Services (CMS) resolution.&nbsp; We also identified several areas where improvements in the contractor's internal controls
  and cost allocation system are needed.&nbsp; We recommended that the contractor reduce its claim by $5,158,255,&nbsp; provide
  documentation to the CMS contracting officer to support the allowability and allocability of the $104,836,580 of costs
  set aside, and implement various procedural recommendations to ensure that administrative costs charged to Medicare are
  allowable.&nbsp; A follow-up report&nbsp; was issued on April 21, 2003 (<a href="40302024.htm">report number A-04-03-02024</a>).</p>
