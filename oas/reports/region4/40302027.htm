<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objectives were to determine whether Alabama (1) 
calculated the upper payment limit (UPL) for State and non-State government hospitals and for 
non-State government nursing facilities in accordance with Federal regulations 
and the approved State plan amendments and (2) properly included UPL payments in 
the calculation of hospital-specific disproportionate share hospital (DSH) limits.&nbsp; We found that for State fiscal 
year (FY) 2003, Alabama generally calculated the State and non-State government 
hospital outpatient UPLs in compliance with Federal regulations and its State 
plan amendment.&nbsp; However, Alabama did not comply with its State plan amendment 
when calculating the State and non-State government hospital inpatient UPLs, nor 
did it comply with the revised Federal regulations when calculating the 
non-State government nursing facility UPL.&nbsp; Also, Alabama did not include all hospital UPL payments in its calculation of 
hospital-specific DSH limits.&nbsp; The 
actual DSH limits and associated overpayments cannot be computed until the UPL 
findings in this report are resolved.&nbsp; Thus, we are leaving this matter to the 
State and CMS for resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0in">We recommended that 
Alabama (1) refund to the Federal Government $25,746,634<b> </b>in UPL 
overpayments to State and non-State government facilities, (2) comply with the 
approved State plan when calculating hospital inpatient UPLs for State and 
non-State government facilities for periods subsequent to our audit period, (3) 
remove the State facility from the non-State government nursing facility UPL 
calculation for periods subsequent to our audit period, (4) work with CMS to 
resolve potential DSH overpayments currently valued at $47,685,747, and (5) 
include all UPL payments when calculating hospital-specific DSH limits for 
periods subsequent to our audit period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0in">With respect to our second recommendation, 
Alabama said that it did comply with its State plan amendment in the UPL 
calculations for inpatient hospital services and that CMS had determined that 
Alabama’s UPL calculations were in compliance with the State plan.&nbsp; With respect 
to our fourth recommendation on resolving potential DSH overpayments, the State 
replied that it had properly calculated the cost of uncompensated care and was 
working with CMS on this issue.&nbsp; The State’s response did not warrant any 
revisions to the results of our review or to our recommendations.</p>
