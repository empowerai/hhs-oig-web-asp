<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to review the records and supporting documentation relating to $104.8 million of administrative
  costs set-aside in a prior audit of costs claimed by Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Florida (Contractor) during the period
  from fiscal years (FY) 1995 through 1998 and to determine if the costs were reasonable, allocable and allowable for Medicare
  reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Contractor was able to support the $104,836,580 in costs previously set-aside in our earlier audit (<a href="49905561.htm">report
    number A-04-99-05561, issued in July 2002</a>).&nbsp; We found the Contractor to be much more responsive to our audit
    requests for supporting documentation.&nbsp; For the most part, the FY 1998 costs we reviewed were adequately supported,
    their allocation to Medicare was reasonable, and the costs were considered allowable.&nbsp; We found certain Return on
    Investment (ROI) costs claimed to be unallowable for reimbursement ($1,277,247).&nbsp; However, we also concurred with
    the Contractor’s revised claim for additional ROI reimbursement totaling $1,433,237.</p>
<p>Additionally, information presented by the Contractor about the method of cost allocation in the prior years (FY 1995-1997)
  provided assurance that we could apply our FY 1998 results to the prior years.&nbsp; Therefore, we recommend that $104,992,570
  be allowed for Medicare reimbursement purposes.&nbsp; This amount represents the original amount set-aside of $104,836,580
  less $1,277,247 for non-allowable ROI costs plus $1,433,237 for additional allowable ROI costs.</p>
