<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to evaluate whether State controls were
  adequate to prevent improper Medicaid payments to nursing homes under the denial
  of payment remedy, and ensure the mandatory denial of payment remedy for substandard
  quality of care was applied in nursing homes that were not in substantial compliance
  with the prescribed Medicaid participation requirements.&nbsp; Our audit included
  denial of payment sanctions, which were in effect or should have been in effect
  from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2001.&nbsp; We found that the State permitted
  improper Medicaid payments for new admissions totaling $176,853 ($99,957 Federal
  share) to sanctioned nursing homes.&nbsp; We recommended a financial adjustment
  and implementation of additional procedures to ensure payments to provider
  are suspended timely.&nbsp; In response, the State agreed that $135,397 of
  the $176,853 ($99,957 Federal share) recommended for adjustment was unallowable.&nbsp; They
  concurred with our recommendation for implementation of additional procedures.</p>
