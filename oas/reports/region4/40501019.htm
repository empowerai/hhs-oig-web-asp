</p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether costs recorded by the National Institute
  of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance
  with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; The NIEHS Superfund costs recorded for the period
  from October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2004, were allowable, allocable, and reasonable.&nbsp; We
  also determined that NIEHS took appropriate action to ensure that its Superfund grantees
  submitted required audit reports.&nbsp; Because the report contained no recommendations,
  we did not request a response from NIH.</p>
