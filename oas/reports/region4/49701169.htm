<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report estimates that Med Tech Home Health Services, Inc. was overpaid Medicare funds totaling at least
  $1.9 million in Calendar Year 1996 for services that did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements. A statistical sample
  of 100 claims disclosed unallowable payments for: (1) 288 services included in 20 claims that were provided to beneficiaries
  who were not homebound; (2) 233 services included in 16 claims that were not reasonable or necessary in the opinion of
  medical personnel; and (3) 56 services included in 6 claims for home health aide services provided to beneficiaries who
  had contracted with private agencies to receive similar type services, therefore, the aide services were unnecessary. We
  are recommending that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) instruct the Fiscal Intermediary (FI) to recover
  overpayments of $1.9 million, and require the FI to instruct Med Tech on its responsibilities to properly monitor subcontractors
  for compliance with Medicare regulations. The HCFA concurred with our recommendations. </p>
