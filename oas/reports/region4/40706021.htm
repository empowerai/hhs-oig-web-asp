<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Of the 300 high-dollar 
payments in our random samples of claims that First Coast Service Options, Inc. 
(First Coast) paid to providers, 299 were appropriate.&nbsp; First Coast overpaid a 
provider during calendar years (CY) 2004–2006, $12,356 for the remaining claim.&nbsp; First Coast made the overpayment in 
calendar year 2005 because the provider incorrectly claimed excessive units of 
service.&nbsp; In addition, the Medicare claim processing systems did not have 
sufficient edits in place during CYs 2003–2005 to detect and prevent payments 
for these types of erroneous claims.&nbsp; We recommended that First Coast 
recover the $12,000 overpayment.&nbsp; First Coast agreed to recover the $12,000 
overpayment.</p>
