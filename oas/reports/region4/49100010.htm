<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report points out that the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) made cash and
  medical assistance payments to refugees who were not eligible for assistance and in a few instances assistance was erroneously
  provided to nonrefugees. This occurred primarily because the HRS did not have edits in its computerized payment system
  to identify refugees whose eligibility period had expired. We recommended procedural changes to improve HRS' administration
  of the refugee resettlement program. We also recommended a financial adjustment of $1,112,350 for the ineligible cash and
  medical assistance payments. </p>
