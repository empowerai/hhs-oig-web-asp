<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether the State had established systems and procedures to properly monitor,
  report, identify, collect and write-off Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) overpayments; and to evaluate the
  adequacy of the systems and procedures in place to assure that overpayments were processed accurately, timely, and in compliance
  with Federal regulations.&nbsp; The State's systems and procedures appeared adequate to assure that overpayments were processed
  accurately, timely, and in compliance with Federal regulations.&nbsp; However, for the period April 1, 1997 through March
  31, 2001, the State included Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) overpayment recoveries totaling $77,742 in the
  AFDC overpayment amount returned to the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).&nbsp; The State should have retained
  the Federal share of TANF overpayment recoveries for use in funding the TANF program.&nbsp; This problem occurred because
  of computer programming errors discovered in two of the State’s reporting systems.&nbsp; We recommended that the State
  correct its reporting systems and make an adjustment for the recoupments refunded to ACF in error.&nbsp; State officials
  agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
