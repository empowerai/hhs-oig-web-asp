<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of the $13.81 million of costs reviewed from August 1, 
2002, through July 31, 2005, $13.66 million 
appeared reasonable for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; Of the remaining costs, QSource, 
the Tennessee Quality Improvement Organization (QIO), 
incurred $31,000 of costs that were unallowable and $124,000 of costs that were 
potentially unallowable.&nbsp; The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services 
contracts with QIOs in each State to improve the quality of care.&nbsp; We 
conducted this review at the request of the Senate Finance Committee.<br>
<br>
We recommended that QSource (1) refund $6,700 for unallowable physician 
consultant fees, (2) reduce the indirect cost pool by $24,000 for the balance of 
unallowable costs incurred, and (3) work with the CMS contracting officer to 
determine what portion of the $124,000 incurred for conference-related costs 
during our audit period should be excluded from the indirect cost pool for 
purposes of determining final rates.<br>
<br>
In its written comments on our draft report, QSource agreed in part and 
disagreed in part with our findings and recommendations and submitted additional 
documentation regarding conference costs.&nbsp; The comments and additional 
documentation did not change our findings or recommendations.</p>
