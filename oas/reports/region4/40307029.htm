<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</B></P>
<p>Our objective was to identify any Medicaid overpayments resulting from payments to providers for medical
  services claimed to have been rendered after the month in which a beneficiary died.&nbsp; We found
  that Florida made Medicaid payments for medical services claimed to have been rendered after the month
  of a beneficiary’s death.&nbsp; Specifically, for a sample of 200 Medicaid payments made on behalf
  of eligible beneficiaries who died during our audit period, the State made 48 payments after the beneficiaries’ deaths
  that amounted to $15,765 ($8,811 Federal share).&nbsp; We recommended that the State:&nbsp; (1) review
  our sampling universe to identify and recover, where appropriate, overpayments estimated at $11.6 million
  ($6.5 million Federal share) made on behalf of deceased beneficiaries and (2) improve its procedures
  for identifying deceased beneficiaries to prevent overpayments in the future.&nbsp; In response to
  our draft report, the State Medicaid agency agreed to implement our recommendations.</p>
