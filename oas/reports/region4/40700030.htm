<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For fiscal year 2005, Specialty Hospital of Jacksonville’s 
(Specialty) average Medicare inpatient length of stay exceeded 25 days.&nbsp; Thus, 
Specialty complied with Federal regulations governing average length of stay, 
and its classification as a long-term care hospital (LTCH) was proper.&nbsp; 
Hospitals classified as LTCHs must have an average Medicare inpatient length of 
stay of greater than 25 days, which includes all Medicare covered and 
noncovered days and omits all Medicare leave and pass days. &nbsp;However, hospitals 
that were excluded from the prospective payment system in 1986 were subject to a 
different length of stay requirement.&nbsp; These hospitals must have an average 
inpatient length of stay for all patients of greater than 20 days.&nbsp; Specialty 
was subject to the 25-day average length-of-stay requirement.&nbsp; The Centers for 
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, which administers the Medicare program, directed 
the Medicare fiscal intermediaries to verify that LTCHs complied with Federal 
requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because Specialty complied with 
Federal regulations, we are not offering any recommendations.</p>
