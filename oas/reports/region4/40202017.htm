<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine if the costs claimed by Tampa General Hospital (TGH) were properly stated
  in accordance with the Medicare reimbursement criteria.&nbsp; Our review focused on the organ acquisition costs claimed
  by TGH totaling $7,001,918 on the Medicare cost report for fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 1999.&nbsp; The Medicare
  reimbursement for organ acquisition costs in FY 1999 was overstated by $1,459,070.&nbsp; The majority of the excess reimbursement
  was the cumulative result of TGH overstating the direct costs for kidney and liver acquisition and understating the direct
  costs for heart acquisitions on the cost report.&nbsp; We recommended that TGH file an amended cost report for FY 1999
  to incorporate these adjustments and reduce its claim for Medicare reimbursement by $1,459,070.&nbsp; We also recommended
  that TGH establish procedures and accounting controls to assure the proper reporting of organ acquisition costs allocated
  to Medicare.&nbsp; In addition, we recommended that TGH review its cost reports for subsequent years and file amended cost
  reports as necessary to ensure that the cost reports are free of the types of errors identified during our audit.</p>
