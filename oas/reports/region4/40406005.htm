<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether University of Louisville Hospital included the appropriate
  number of dental residents in its full-time equivalent (FTE) counts when computing Medicare
  graduate medical education (GME) payments for fiscal years (FYs) 2000 through 2002. &nbsp;Although
  the Hospital appropriately included dental residents in its FTE counts used to compute FYs
  2000 and 2001 GME payments, in FY 2002 the Hospital inappropriately included a dental resident
  who was a graduate of a foreign dental school.&nbsp; As a result, the Hospital overstated
  its direct and indirect GME claims by $15,759 for FY 2002.&nbsp; The Hospital also included
  didactic, i.e., classroom, time for the residents when working in nonhospital settings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We recommended that the Hospital:&nbsp; (1) file an amended cost report to refund $15,759,
  (2) establish and follow procedures for foreign dental school graduates, (3) determine whether
  similar errors occurred after FY 2002 and refund any overpayments, and (4) work with CMS
  to resolve the $139,704 related to FYs 2000 through 2002 FTEs for the didactic time of residents
  assigned to nonhospital settings.&nbsp; The Hospital concurred with our first, third, and
  fourth recommendations.</p>
