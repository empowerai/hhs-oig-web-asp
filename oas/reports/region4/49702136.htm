<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria Behavioral Health Services, a Community Mental Health Center located in Miami, Florida, received reimbursement
  for partial hospitalization services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The audit showed that the center did not meet
  the certification requirements established under Sections 1916(c)94) of the Public Health Service Act and 1861 of the Social
  Security Act. Further, we found that none of the 20 medicare beneficiaries in our sample were eligible for partial hospitalization
  benefits and that $1,196,664 of the $1,959,296 paid for services provided to the 20 beneficiaries in our sample were unnecessary,
  unreasonable and unallowable under Medicare coverage and reimbursement criteria. We also found that the center claimed
  reimbursement for unreasonable and unallowable administrative costs, including related party costs that had not been properly
  disclosed. </p>
<p>Based on the audit, we recommended that the entire $4,510,161 paid to the center during their participation in the Medicare
  program be disallowed. Medicare payments to the center were suspended with notice and the findings were referred for possible
  criminal prosecution. </p>
