<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Mississippi Action for Progress&#8217; (MAP) compensation
  practices for the top five key executives and for teachers were reasonable and consistent with Federal requirements and
  guidelines.&nbsp; MAP&#8217;s compensation for teachers appeared reasonable and consistent with Federal requirements when
  compared to other Head Start grantees in Mississippi as well as teachers employed by the State.&nbsp; Also, cost of living
  allowances were allocated and quality improvement funds used in a manner consistent with Administration for Children and
  Families program instructions.&nbsp; However, MAP did not have a current wage study to support the compensation paid to
  its employees.&nbsp; MAP also did not comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-122 when allocating executive
  compensation charges to Head Start and other programs.&nbsp; We also identified four aspects of MAP&#8217;s financial operations
  that needed improvement.&nbsp; MAP officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
