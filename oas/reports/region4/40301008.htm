<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that the Florida Department of Health (Florida)
  generally accounted for program funds&nbsp;($6.4 million received for the 2-year period ending March 31, 2004) in accordance
  with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
  and applicable departmental regulations and guidelines.&nbsp; Florida did not segregate expenditures by phase, within phase,
  or by priority area in its accounting system; however, Florida tracked expenditures by phase and priority area on spreadsheets.&nbsp; Although
  segregation was not required, budget restrictions were specified in the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; Florida officials
  acknowledged the importance of tracking expenditures in order to comply with the budget restrictions.&nbsp; In addition,
  Florida’s sub-recipients must submit reports on their activities and expenditures.&nbsp; Although Florida officials had
  not completed any site visits to sub-recipients, it was in the process of developing a site visit component.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
  Florida officials stated that HRSA funding had not been used to supplant programs previously provided by other organizational
  sources.&nbsp; We recommended Florida make changes to its accounting system to segregate expenditures by phase and priority
  area; and, implement the site visit component and address problem areas as they are identified.&nbsp; Florida concurred
  with our findings and recommendations and stated it would take the necessary steps to fully comply with the HRSA grant
  guidelines.</p>
