<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine the reasonableness and allowability of Medicaid costs claimed for reimbursement by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (the State agency) as a result of contingency fee arrangements with consultants.&nbsp;The State agency overstated its claims for reimbursement by $125,361 (Federal share) for cost report adjustments owing to the use of misclassified expense data during computation of the claim.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency refund $125,361.&nbsp;The State agency agreed.</p>
