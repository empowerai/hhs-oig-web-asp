<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">In response to Hurricane Katrina, section 6201 of the 
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 authorized Federal funding for the total costs of 
medically necessary uncompensated care furnished to evacuees and affected 
individuals without other coverage in eligible States, i.e., States that 
provided care to such individuals under section 1115 projects.&nbsp; The University 
of Mississippi Medical Center (the Medical Center) received $17.9 million in 
uncompensated care reimbursement.<br>
<br>
The State agency generally claimed reimbursement for services provided by the 
Medical Center in accordance with the approved section 1115 demonstration and 
uncompensated care pool plan.&nbsp; Of the 200 sampled claims, 196 claims were 
allowable.&nbsp; The remaining four claims totaling $22,379 were improper because the 
individuals who received the services had health care coverage under other 
programs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) the $22,379 paid to the Medical Center for improper 
uncompensated care claims and (2) consider reviewing the Medical Center’s claims 
that were not included in the sample to ensure that no other health care 
coverage was available and make refunds to CMS if appropriate.&nbsp; The State agency 
did not fully agree with the recommendations but said that it would make the 
proper adjustments in cooperation with CMS.</p>
