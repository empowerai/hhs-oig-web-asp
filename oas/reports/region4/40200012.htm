<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our audit was designed to assess whether Florida appropriately charged the Federal Government for the pension expenses
  of State agency employees.&nbsp; We found that Florida appropriately used funds designated as retirement contributions
  during the 3 years ended June 30, 2002, solely to pay pension-related expenses.&nbsp; However, we found that these contributions
  were in excess of the amounts reasonable and necessary to fully fund benefits.&nbsp; Florida has maintained a surplus relating
  to State-agency contributions totaling about $3 billion ($267 million Federal share).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Florida attributes the surplus primarily to exceptional investment performance and has taken steps to reduce the
  surplus.&nbsp; However, the rate stabilization mechanism established by Florida’s State legislature prevents the entire
  surplus from being available for contribution rate reductions or benefit enhancements.&nbsp; We believe the long-term continuation
  of this surplus continues to violate the Federal cost principle contained in Section C.1.a. of Office of Management and
  Budget Circular A-87, Attachment A that requires costs:&nbsp; “Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient performance
  and administration of Federal awards.”&nbsp; We recommended that Florida reduce contribution rates to a level necessary
  to fully fund pension expenses over the long term, including amending as necessary its “rate stabilization mechanism” contained
  in the Florida Statutes.&nbsp; As an alternative, Florida may repay $267,138,120 to the Federal Government.&nbsp; Florida
  officials generally disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
