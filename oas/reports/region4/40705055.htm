<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Although Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators, LLC (Cahaba GBA) generally claimed over $14 million in depreciation expense that was reasonable, allowable, and allocable during fiscal years 2001 through 2004, it inappropriately claimed approximately $36,152 in unallowable depreciation expenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cahaba GBA&rsquo;s unallowable claims for depreciation expenses were caused by insufficient controls over depreciation and associated assets.&nbsp;During our audit period, Cahaba GBA significantly improved its controls over depreciation.&nbsp;However, further upgrades are necessary to integrate the system for tracking assets with the system for tracking the depreciation claimed for those assets.&nbsp;We recommended that Cahaba GBA reimburse the Medicare program $36,152 for unallowable depreciation expenses and establish controls that integrate depreciation costs with accountability of the assets being depreciated.&nbsp;Cahaba concurred with our recommendations. </p>
