<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that North Carolina has an opportunity to increase enrollment in the State
  Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and have noncustodial parents pay a portion of the associated premiums.&nbsp; Based
  on a statistical sample, we estimated that 30,809 Title IV-D children would have been eligible to receive SCHIP benefits
  from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002.&nbsp; The noncustodial parents of 20,637 of these children could have contributed
  $16.4 million toward the $24.9 million in premiums that would have been incurred if the children had been enrolled.&nbsp; We
  also determined that 8,776 Title IV-D children received SCHIP benefits during the audit period.&nbsp; An estimated 3,686
  of these children had noncustodial parents who could have contributed $1.9 million toward the $3.6 million in SCHIP premiums
  paid on behalf of their children.&nbsp; We recommended that North Carolina take appropriate steps to recover SCHIP premiums
from noncustodial parents with medical support orders and the ability to pay for their dependent children.</p>
