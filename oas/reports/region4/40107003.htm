<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of this survey was to determine whether the Medicare program might be paying for services that should be
  covered by the Florida Workers’ Compensation (WC) program.&nbsp; Our survey indicated that there is a high vulnerability
  of the Medicare program to erroneous payments being made to WC beneficiaries in Florida.&nbsp; We recommended that the
  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Region IV:&nbsp; continue to implement procedures within the regional
  office for acquiring, tracking, evaluating, and responding to WC settlements; provide training to regional office staff
  and to contractor staff responsible for reviewing WC settlements; establish a point of contact with a representative of
  the Florida Division of WC, and persuade the individual of the need for CMS to have access to State WC records on a continual
  basis in order to match potential claims; and consider the ICD-9 diagnosis codes that we identified in this survey as being
  associated with WC claims in the State, in developing any future edits that may be implemented by CMS.&nbsp; The CMS Region
  IV generally concurred with our findings and recommendations. </p>
