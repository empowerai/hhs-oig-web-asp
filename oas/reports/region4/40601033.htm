<strong>



<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">The audit objectives were to 
(1) summarize the findings in our eight individual reports and (2) determine 
whether CDC had resolved the audit recommendations in those reports in a timely 
manner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The individual audits found that<b> </b>each of the eight 
entities had appointed a Responsible Official to provide management oversight of 
its select agent program.&nbsp; However, certain other controls at all eight entities 
did not comply with Federal regulations and each entity had weaknesses in at 
least one control area that could have compromised their ability to safeguard 
select agents from accidental or intentional loss.<br>
<br>
In responding to our draft report, CDC stated that it had resolved our 
recommendations at five of the eight entities and that the remaining three 
entities had withdrawn their certificates of registration and no longer 
possessed select agents.&nbsp; CDC attached audit clearance documents resolving the 
recommendations in our reports to all eight entities.&nbsp; Therefore, this final 
report contains no recommendation.</p>
