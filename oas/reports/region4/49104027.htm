<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report points out that the percentage of AIDS grant funds used for administrative expenses may have been too high
  at two grantees in Florida. We found that about $4.3 million of $10.7 million (40 percent) was used for administrative
  costs. Precedents exist for limiting the percentage of funds which can be expended for administrative costs. Had this been
  done for these grants, a significant amount of funds would have been available for providing direct services to AIDS patients. </p>
