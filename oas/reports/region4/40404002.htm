<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Based on our review of 145 current direct care employees, we found that Glen
  Haven complied with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations. &nbsp;However,
  we noted differences in the direct care hours per resident per day that we
  calculated and the hours of care reported in the Nursing Home Compare website.&nbsp; Glen
  Haven agreed with our finding and recommendation and stated that a new system
  has been implemented that will allow the hours to be verified.</p>
