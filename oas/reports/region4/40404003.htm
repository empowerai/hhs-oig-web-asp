<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Based on our review of 100 current direct care employees, we found that Dublinair complied
  with the specific Federal and State staffing laws and regulations that we reviewed.&nbsp; Further,
  Dublinair complied with the State background check requirement for all current direct care
  employees.&nbsp; However, we noted differences in the direct care hours per resident per
  day that we calculated and the hours of care reported in the Nursing Home Compare web site.&nbsp; We
  recommended that Dublinair establish a control to independently confirm the validity of the
  direct care hours that are provided to the Georgia State Survey Agency for input into the
  Nursing Home Compare web site.&nbsp; The Dublinair Administrator agreed with our finding
  and recommendation and stated that in the future the number reported to the State Survey
  Agency will be taken directly from the facility’s computerized payroll records and that the
  records will be produced at the time of the survey and maintained in the facility’s records
  for future reference.</p>
