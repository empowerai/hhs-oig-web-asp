<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This report points out that Alabama made disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments that did not comply with the hospital-specific
  DSH payment limits mandated by the Social Security Act.&nbsp; As a result, hospitals participating in the managed care
  arrangement were overpaid about $66 million ($46 million Federal share) in fiscal years 1999 and 2000.&nbsp; In addition
  to a financial adjustment for th4e $46 million, we recommended that Alabama calculate DSH limits to include an offset for
  all Medicaid enhanced payments received by hospitals and calculate uncompensated care costs annually.&nbsp; We also recommended
  that Alabama establish controls to ensure the reasonableness and allowability of future uncompensated care costs.</p>
