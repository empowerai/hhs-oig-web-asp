<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether costs recorded by National Institute
  of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) were allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance
  with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; The NIEHS Superfund costs recorded for the period
  from October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2004, were allowable, allocable, and reasonable.&nbsp; NIEHS
  obligated about $80.4 million and disbursed about $80.2 million in Superfund resources.&nbsp; We
  also determined that NIEHS took appropriate action to ensure that its Superfund grantees
  submitted required audit reports.&nbsp; Since this report contained no recommendations, no
  response was necessary.</p>
