<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether the Medicaid Management
  Information Systems (MMIS) expenditures claimed at the 75 percent Federal financial participation rate by the Georgia Medicaid
  agency during Federal fiscal year 2002 were adequately supported and allowable.&nbsp; Overall, the MMIS costs claimed by
  the State for Federal reimbursement at the 75&nbsp;percent rate were adequately supported and allowable.&nbsp; Of the costs
  reviewed, we found only $12,232 (Federal share $9,174) that was not related to the MMIS services, and was considered unallowable
  for Federal reimbursement.&nbsp; The State concurred with our findings and recommendation to reimburse the Federal share.</p>
