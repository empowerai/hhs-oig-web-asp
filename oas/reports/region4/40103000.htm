<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this audit were to:&nbsp; (1) determine the amount and collectibility of non-tax delinquent debt owed
  to Medicare that existed at September 30, 2000; and (2) assess the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Region
  IV Regional Office&#146;s (RO) management activities to ensure that pro-active measures are taken to collect the delinquent
  debt before it is referred to the Treasury for collection.&nbsp; The accounts receivable balances CMS RO reported on the
  R751 for financial statement purposes for the period ending September 30, 2000 for Part A (non-MSP (Medicare Secondary
  Payor), MSP and Currently Not Collectible (CNC)) accounts receivable was $25,120,726 in principal and $19,531,898 in interest
  and the balance for Part B (non-MSP, MSP and CNC) was $161,654,066 in principal and $89,712,836 in interest.&nbsp; Our
  reconciliation of these balances to the subsidiary records showed the Part A non-MSP was understated by $102,927,298 and
  the Part B non-MSP was overstated by $2,608,769.&nbsp; We also determined that the Part A MSP balance was overstated by
  $3,516.&nbsp; Other audit tests we performed on statistical samples of Part A non-MSP and Part B non-MSP balances showed
  the vast majority of receivables were recorded, supported, complete, properly valued and existed at September 30, 2000.&nbsp; We
  recommended that the RO:&nbsp; (1) promptly reconcile their support before reporting the amounts on the R751, RC751 and
  the RM751; (2) increase the Part A balances totaling $102,923,782 and reduce the Part B balances totaling $3,653,761; (2)
  correct status codes on three Part B balances to show the accurate location of the balances; (3) establish a system of
  internal control that will provide adequate and timely tracking of its collection activities; and (4) transfer two Part
  A MSP balances totaling $4,114 back to the contractor.</p>
