<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Our objective was to determine whether the University of 
California at San Francisco Medical Center (the Hospital) included the 
appropriate number of dental residents in its full-time equivalent (FTE) counts 
when computing Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments for fiscal 
years (FYs) 2000 through 2002.&nbsp; The Hospital overstated its direct and indirect 
GME claims by a total of $3,904,526 for FYs 2000 through 2002.&nbsp; The Hospital 
inappropriately included a total of 153.88 direct GME FTEs and 159.69 indirect 
GME FTEs in the counts for FYs 2000 through 2002.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We recommended that the Hospital (1) file an amended cost 
report, which will result in a refund of $3,904,526 associated with FTEs for 
which the Hospital did not incur all or substantially all of the training costs; 
(2) establish and follow written procedures to ensure that the FTE counts for 
residents in nonhospital settings include only those FTEs for which the Hospital 
has incurred all or substantially all of the training costs; and (3) determine 
whether errors similar to those identified in our review occurred in Medicare 
cost reports after FY 2002 and refund any overpayments.&nbsp; The Hospital generally 
disagreed with our findings and recommendations.</p>
