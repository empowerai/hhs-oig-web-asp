<p><font color="#000080">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</font></strong><font color="#000080"> <br>
<br>
The objective of this audit </font> <span style="color:#000080">was t</span><font color="#000080">o determine 
whether the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) made Refugee Cash 
Assistance (RCA) payments only to beneficiaries whose eligibility periods had 
not expired.&nbsp; We found that during the 3-year period end June 30, 2005, DCF 
made payments totaling at least $55,530 to beneficiaries whose 
eligibility periods had expired.&nbsp; In addition, DCF’s computerized eligibility 
system contained missing or inaccurate dates of entry or of asylum for some 
beneficiaries, allowing erroneous payments to occur. &nbsp;As a result, DCF made 
$9,561 in additional erroneous payments to 20 beneficiaries.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In addition to certain procedural recommendations, we  
recommended that DCF make a financial adjustment of $55,530 for the RCA payments 
made to ineligible beneficiaries and $9,561 for RCA payments to 20 
beneficiaries whose dates of entry or of asylum were not documented in the case 
files.&nbsp; DCF generally concurred with our recommendations.&nbsp; However, DCF did not 
address what steps it would take regarding the 20 beneficiaries whose case files 
did not contain documents that established their eligibility for RCA payments.&nbsp; 
Therefore, we continued to recommend that DCF recover the $9,561 in overpayments 
for these 20 beneficiaries.</font></p>
