<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine whether Florida appropriately
  charged the Federal Government for administrative expenses of selected trust
  funds.&nbsp; We found that the State inappropriately assessed an administrative
  fee totaling $108,850 on the interest earnings of two trust funds maintained
  by the State Department of Juvenile Justice.&nbsp; The State used these administrative
  fees to support general government operations.&nbsp; OMB Circular A-87 prohibits
  the use of Federal funds for the cost of general government.&nbsp; The State
  did not adequately monitor the trust funds to ensure that all trust funds that
  contained Federal funds were exempt from the administrative fee assessment.&nbsp; In
  addition to procedural recommendations, we recommended that the State repay
  the $108,850 to the State&#8217;s Department of Juvenile Justice trust funds.&nbsp; The
  State concurred with our findings and recommendations.</p>
