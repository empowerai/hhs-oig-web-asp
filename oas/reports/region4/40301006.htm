<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
  <p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Medicare properly reimbursed Morton Plant Hospital for outpatient
  cardiac rehabilitation services.&nbsp; We found no documentation to support physician supervision during exercise sessions.&nbsp; In
  addition, we did not find sufficient evidence in the medical records to indicate that the cardiac rehabilitation services
  were provided “incident to” the medical director’s professional services.&nbsp; Also, from our claims review for 30 sampled
  beneficiaries who received outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services during calendar year 2001, we determined that the
  hospital received Medicare payments of $4,426 for services provided to beneficiaries where medical documentation may not
  have supported Medicare covered diagnoses and for services not otherwise allowable. We recommended correction of internal
  control weaknesses and other procedural improvements.</p>
