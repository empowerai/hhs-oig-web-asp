<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The Florida Adult Care Enterprises, a Community Mental Health Center located in Hollywood, Florida, received reimbursement
  for partial hospitalization program services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Our audit showed that none of the services
  provided to a sample of 40 beneficiaries were medically necessary and therefore allowable for reimbursement under Medicare
  coverage and reimbursement criteria. The services provided were not ordered by a physician, were not provided to eligible
  beneficiaries and were not properly documented. </p>
<p>Based on the audit, we recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) instruct the fiscal intermediary
  to recover the $1,709,245 paid to the center for unallowable services to the sample beneficiaries. In addition, HCFA also
  terminated the center's provider agreement under the Medicare program. </p>
