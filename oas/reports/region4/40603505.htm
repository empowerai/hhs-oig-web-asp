<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether the State agency equitably allocated
  administrative costs to the Title IV-E program from April 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003. &nbsp;The
  State agency undermined the statistical validity of the random moment study (RMS) by altering
  the random moment for employees with nontraditional work schedules and adding unapproved
  positions that may have skewed the results of the RMS, resulting in either an understated
  or overstated percentage of time charged to Title IV-E activities.&nbsp; These conditions
  occurred because the State agency failed to design an RMS that complied with Federal guidelines
  and statistical sampling standards.&nbsp; As a result, the State agency may not have equitably
  allocated $49.1 million ($24.5 million Federal share) in administrative costs to the Title
  IV-E program.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency continue to work with the Department
  of Health and Human Services, Division of Cost Allocation to ensure that the time study methodology
  equitably allocates costs to the benefiting programs.&nbsp; The State agency agreed with
  our recommendations.</p>
