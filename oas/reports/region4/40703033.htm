<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">For the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, we 
estimate that the Georgia Department of Community Health (the State agency), which 
manages the Georgia Medicaid program, paid $4,332,000 ($2,622,000 Federal share) 
on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been eligible due to their 
Medicaid eligibility in Florida.&nbsp; Medicaid eligibility in each State is based on 
residency.&nbsp; If a resident of one State subsequently establishes residency in 
another State, the beneficiary’s Medicaid eligibility in the previous State 
should end.&nbsp; From a statistical random sample of 100 beneficiary-months totaling 
$83,000 in Medicaid services, the State agency made payments for 29 
beneficiary-months totaling $45,000 for services provided to beneficiaries who 
should not have been eligible to receive Medicaid benefits in Georgia.&nbsp; The 
remaining 71 beneficiary-months were for services to beneficiaries who were 
eligible to receive the benefit.&nbsp; We recommended that the State agency work with 
the Florida Medicaid agency to share available Medicaid eligibility information 
for use in determining accurate beneficiary eligibility status and reducing the 
amount of payments made on behalf of beneficiaries residing in Florida.&nbsp; The 
State agency generally agreed with our recommendations.</p>
