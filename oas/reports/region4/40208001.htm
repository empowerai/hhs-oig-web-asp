<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The final report points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had not implemented a system to
  allocate its organization-wide indirect costs on a reasonable and consistent basis, as required by Federal accounting standards.&nbsp; Instead,
  CDC relied on allocation methodologies that resulted in overcharges and undercharges affecting almost all programs and
  activities.&nbsp; With the assistance of a consulting firm, CDC made some modifications to its allocation methods in 1998
  and was able to reduce some of the overcharges and undercharges.&nbsp; Agency projections showed, however, that HIV/AIDS,
  one of CDC's largest programs, was charged about $11.9 million for excessive indirect costs during FYs 2000 and 2001.&nbsp; Implementation
  of the indirect costing system was delayed because CDC, viewing the system developed by the consulting firm in 1999 as
  overly complex and difficult to maintain, contracted with a public accounting firm to evaluate and simplify the proposed
  system.&nbsp; CDC first implemented the simplified system in FY 2002, and, after evaluating the implementation and making
  some minor modifications, fully implemented it in FY 2003.&nbsp; We believe the new system represents a significant improvement
  by allocating indirect costs more equitably and providing accurate information on the full costs of CDC's program and activities.&nbsp; We
  recommended that CDC evaluate the effects of overcharging indirect costs to HIV/AIDS and its other programs to assure a
  correct accounting of program activities.&nbsp; In addition, because program funding levels and requirements may change
  over time, we also recommended that CDC periodically evaluate indirect costing methods to ensure a continued equitable
  allocation of such costs.&nbsp; CDC concurred with our recommendations.</p>
