<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final audit report discusses Federal grant funds awarded to Rural Health Services, Inc., d/b/a the Margaret J. Weston
  Medical Center, under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Our audit was initiated following allegations from
  a former member of the Center's Board of Directors related to misappropriation and mismanagement of grant funds as well
  as fraudulent billings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. </p>
<p>Our audit disclosed no misappropriation of Federal grant funds or fraudulent billings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
  However we found significant deficiencies in almost every aspect of the Center's fiscal and administrative operations during
  the period June 1, 1994 through May 31, 1998. </p>
<p>In response to the deteriorating conditions and the Center's apparent unwillingness to implement the necessary corrective
  actions, the Health Resources and Services Administration made continuation grant support to the Center conditional upon
  formation of a new Board of Directors. The new Board took office in May 1998 and employed a new Executive Director to manage
  Center operations in 1998. We are recommending that the Board of Directors and Executive Director continue their efforts
  to rebuild the Center's fiscal and administrative operations. </p>
