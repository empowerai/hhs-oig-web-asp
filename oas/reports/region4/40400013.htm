<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) coded claims as &ldquo;discharged to home with home health agency services&rdquo; in compliance with Medicare&rsquo;s transfer regulation during fiscal year 2003.&nbsp;IRFs did not always code claims in compliance with Medicare&rsquo;s transfer regulation.&nbsp;Nationwide, we identified 585 IRF claims coded and paid as discharges to home with home health agency services that potentially should have been paid as transfers.&nbsp;We visited or contacted four IRFs to verify the coding of 44 of these claims and found that all 44 claims should have been coded as transfers.&nbsp;We also repriced a sample of 100 of the 585 claims and estimated that overpayments to IRFs totaled $2,331,042 in fiscal year 2003.</p>
<p>We recommended that CMS: (1) instruct the fiscal intermediaries to review the claims in question and to recover, as appropriate, the estimated $2,331,042 in overpayments; (2) instruct the fiscal intermediaries to review claims paid after our audit period for possible coding errors; and (3) implement edits in the Common Working File to identify potentially miscoded claims.&nbsp;CMS concurred with the recommendations.</p>
