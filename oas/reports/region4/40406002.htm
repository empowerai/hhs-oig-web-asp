<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our objective was to determine whether York Hospital included the appropriate
  number of dental residents in its full-time equivalent (FTE) counts when computing Medicare
  graduate medical education payments for fiscal years (FYs) 2001 and 2002.&nbsp; The Hospital
  generally included the appropriate number of dental residents in its FTE counts.&nbsp; However,
  the number of FTE residents claimed included didactic, i.e., classroom, time for the residents
  when working in nonhospital settings.&nbsp; We recommended that the Hospital work with CMS
  to resolve the $579,977 for the didactic time of residents assigned to nonhospital settings.&nbsp; In
  comments, the Hospital stated that, although the didactic time was claimed based on a CMS
  letter providing general guidance on this matter, the Hospital concurred with our recommendation.</p>
