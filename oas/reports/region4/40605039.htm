<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Of 197 Medicaid-related information technology (IT) 
recommendations that the Office of Inspector General made to State Medicaid agencies 
in 16 final reports between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2005, the Centers 
for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) resolved 17 within the 6-month periods 
following issuance, as required by regulations. &nbsp;CMS resolved an additional 124 
recommendations after the 6-month periods had expired. &nbsp;The remaining 56 
recommendations had not been resolved as of June 30, 2007.&nbsp; CMS did not design 
its procedures for resolving IT audit recommendations to ensure that the 
recommendations were resolved within 6 months.<br>
<br>
We recommended that CMS establish procedures to ensure that all IT audit 
recommendations are resolved within 6 months of receiving an audit report. &nbsp;CMS 
concurred with our recommendation and described steps it has taken to improve 
the audit resolution process.</p>
