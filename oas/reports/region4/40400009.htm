<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>Our objective was to determine whether Georgia’s method of computing inpatient hospital
  cost outlier payments effectively limited outlier payments to high-cost cases.&nbsp; We found
  that Georgia’s method of computing inpatient hospital cost outlier payments did not effectively
  limit outlier payments to high-cost cases.&nbsp; Instead of applying a current cost-to-charge
  ratio (costs divided by charges) to current billed charges from July 1998 through December
  2002, the State agency applied an outdated cost-to-charge ratio to current billed charges,
  thus increasing cost outlier payments.</p>
<p>The State agency relied on historical cost-to-charge ratios because its State plan amendments
  required the use of audited cost report data to calculate cost-to-charge ratios.&nbsp; Audited
  cost reports typically run about 4 years behind the current year.&nbsp; Had the State agency
  applied current cost-to-charge ratios to convert billed charges to costs, it could have saved
  approximately $22.7 million in cost outlier payments between 1998 and 2002 at the three hospitals
  reviewed.</p>
<p>We recommended that the State agency amend its Medicaid State plan to require that the data
  for calculating cost-to-charge ratios be based on submitted cost reports instead of audited
  cost reports.&nbsp; The State agreed with our recommendation.</p>
