<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this review was to determine whether Mountain View was in compliance with Federal and
  State staffing laws and regulations for nursing homes.&nbsp; We found, with minor exceptions, that Mountain View complied
  with Federal and State staffing laws and regulations.&nbsp; For one direct care employee, Mountain View did not comply
  with the State background check requirement.&nbsp; We also noted differences in the direct care hours per resident per
  day that we calculated and the hours of care reported in the Nursing Home Compare website.&nbsp; Mountain View agreed to
  take corrective action to assure that it obtains background checks on all new employees and prohibits employees from working
  directly with the residents if the background checks are not received by the facility.&nbsp; Mountain View also agreed
  to establish a control to independently confirm the validity of the direct care hours that are provided to the Georgia
  State Survey Agency for input into the Nursing Home Compare website.</p>
