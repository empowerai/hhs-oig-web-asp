<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of our review was to determine whether Florida Hospital Heartland (the hospital)
  complied with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data in its fiscal year (FY) 2003
  Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital did not fully comply with Medicare requirements
  for reporting wage data in its FY 2003 Medicare cost report.&nbsp; The hospital overstated
  its wage data by $909,856 and 52,895 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommended that the hospital (1) submit a revised FY 2003 Medicare cost report to the
  fiscal intermediary to correct the wage data overstatements totaling $909,856 and 52,895
  hours and (2) implement review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage data
  reported on future Medicare cost reports are accurate, supportable, and in compliance with
  Medicare requirements.&nbsp; The hospital agreed with our findings and recommendations except
  for our finding regarding home office costs resulting from unallowable supplemental executive
  compensation.</p>
