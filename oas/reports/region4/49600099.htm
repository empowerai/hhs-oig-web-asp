<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>Our review showed that the Capital Area Community Action Agency, Inc. (CACAA) has not developed and implemented an adequate
  internal control system for the proper management of cash receipts, cash disbursements, procurement and accountability
  for property. As a result, there is no assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services' funds are or can be
  expected to be expended and accounted for in accordance with grant terms and conditions. </p>
<p>The internal control system is inadequate because CACAA management did not implement recommendations by the Administration
  for Children and Families (ACF), other funding sources, and independent auditors (CPA) over a period of at least 15 years.
  We recommend that ACF take appropriate actions to address problems at this grantee, including consideration of suspension
  or termination of all ACF funding. </p>
<p>The ACF agreed with our findings and recommendation. The ACF is determining the feasibility of initiating termination
  proceedings against CACAA. </p>
