<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this audit was to determine if managed care organizations (MCO) in Florida received capitation payments
  under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the same services provided to the same beneficiaries during concurrent enrollment
  periods.&nbsp; We found that there were dually eligible beneficiaries concurrently enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid
  MCOs.&nbsp; Our audit indicated there is a need for CMS to work with the Florida Medicaid agency to ensure that both duplicate
  capitation payments as well as duplicate fee-for-service payments will not occur.&nbsp; CMS generally concurred with our
  finding and recommendation.</p>
