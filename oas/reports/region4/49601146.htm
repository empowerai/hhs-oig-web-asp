<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This report provides the results of the Operation Restore Trust audit of the Arbors at Bayonet Point Skilled Nursing Facility
  (SNF) in Hudson, Florida. The objective of the audit was to determine whether charges billed to the Medicare Fiscal Intermediary
  were allowable. </p>
<p>Based on the audit results, we questioned $113,547 of $1,072,765 (10.6%) in Medicare charges reported by the SNF. As can
  be seen in Appendix A, the amount questioned is comprised of $55,415 of charges for which the SNF could not produce adequate
  supporting documentation, $37,602 for services which were not reasonable or medically necessary, and $20,530 for services
  provided individuals who did not meet pre-admission requirements. We attributed the noted discrepancies to poor administrative
  internal controls. </p>
