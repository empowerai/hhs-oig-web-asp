<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that Mississippi retroactively claimed costs under Title IV-E for foster care administrative
  and maintenance payments that did not Federal requirements for reimbursement. Approximately $9.4 million in administrative
  costs included costs that were unallowable, not documented, or claimed at an incorrect Federal sharing rate. Also, maintenance
  payments of about $3.1 million were unallowable for various reasons or were not documented. Finally, $2.5 million represents
  consultant fees unallowable because they were based on a contingency fee arrangement that did not meet Office of Management
  and Budget reimbursement requirements. We recommended financial adjustments. We also recommended procedural improvements
  to help the State preclude such problems in the future. The State generally disagreed with our recommendations for financial
  adjustments, but concurred with many of our recommendations for procedural improvements. </p>
