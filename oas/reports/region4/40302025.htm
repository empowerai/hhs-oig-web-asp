<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</p>
</strong>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our objectives were to determine whether Mississippi calculated (1)
  the upper payment limits (UPLs) for non-State government nursing facilities in accordance
  with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment and (2) the inpatient and
  outpatient UPLs for private, State, and non-State government hospitals in accordance with
  Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendments.&nbsp; Mississippi calculated
  the State fiscal years (FY) 2002 and 2003 UPLs for non-State government nursing facilities
  in accordance with Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment.&nbsp; However,
  for those years, the State did not comply when calculating the inpatient and outpatient UPLs
  for private, State, and non-State government hospitals.&nbsp; As a result, from October 2000
  through December 2002, Mississippi potentially overstated hospital inpatient UPL payments
  by about $183 million and hospital outpatient UPL payments by about $41 million.<span style="font-weight: normal"><br />
  <br />
  We recommended that Mississippi (1) continue to work with CMS to resolve the potential UPL
  overpayments of approximately $224 million ($171 million Federal share) for hospital inpatient
  and outpatient services, (2) implement procedures to ensure that future UPL calculations
  comply with Federal regulations, and (3) identify and refund any overpayments made subsequent
  to our audit period.&nbsp; In commenting on our draft report, the State said that it had
  requested that CMS waive any requirement for the repayment of potential UPL overpayments,
  based on the Katrina disaster.&nbsp; The State added that it had implemented procedures to
  ensure that future UPL calculations comply with Federal regulations and that it was not aware
  of any overpayments made subsequent to our audit period.&nbsp; The State’s comments did not
  warrant any revisions to the results of our review or to our recommendations.</span></p>
