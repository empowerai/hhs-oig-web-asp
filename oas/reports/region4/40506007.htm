<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/HR noshade.lbi" --><hr noshade="noshade" /><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> </p>
<p>The objective of our review
    was to determine whether WellCare of Florida, Inc.’s (WellCare’s) use of its Medicare Prescription
    Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) payment increase was adequately supported
    and allowable under MMA.&nbsp; WellCare appropriately used the MMA payment increase to
    reduce beneficiary cost sharing for basic radiology services, to enhance over-the-counter
    drug benefits, to stabilize beneficiary access to providers through increased provider
    payments, and to cover the administrative costs of offering exclusive Medicare discount
    drug cards to plan members.&nbsp; WellCare’s use of its increased MMA payments was adequately
    supported and allowable.&nbsp; Therefore, we did not make any recommendations.</p>
