<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>This final report points out that of the $707,830 claimed for reimbursement as inpatient Medicare bad debts on Jackson’s
  Fiscal Year 1999 cost report, $157,179 did not comply with the Medicare reimbursement criteria and was therefore unallowable.&nbsp; Many
  of the unallowable bad debts resulted from the hospital’s not making collection efforts on patients who were not indigent.&nbsp; We
  also found instances of clerical errors, duplicate claims, and inadequate documentation to support that patient indigency
  determinations were made or that collection efforts were made on indigent patients.&nbsp; We recommended that Jackson establish
  automated procedures and additional policies to improve their bad debt reporting practices.&nbsp; We also recommended that
  the hospital file an amended cost report for FY 1999 and reduce allowable bad debts claimed by $157,179.</p>
