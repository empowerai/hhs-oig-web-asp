<h2 class="line">Summary</h2>

<p>Twenty portable x-ray suppliers exhibited questionable billing patterns according to criteria we established.  In addition, Medicare paid approximately $12.8 million for return trips to nursing facilities on a single day and, contrary to Federal regulations, Medicare paid approximately $6.6 million for services ordered by nonphysicians (which are not covered).			    </p>
<p>Medicare paid approximately $225 million for x-rays of the extremities, pelvis, spine, skull, chest, and abdomen rendered in 2009 by portable x-ray suppliers.  Portable x-ray suppliers are entities that furnish x-rays at a beneficiary's location using mobile diagnostic equipment.  Medicare pays portable x-ray suppliers separately for the transportation and setup of the mobile equipment in addition to the administration of the test and interpretation of the results.  Pursuant to Federal regulations, portable x-rays must be ordered by a licensed physician.  We used 2008 and 2009 Medicare claims data, nursing home stay data, and provider enrollment data to examine portable x-ray suppliers' billing patterns and to identify individual claims that may warrant further review.</p>
<p>We identified 20 suppliers with billing patterns that met our criteria for questionable billing patterns.  We also found that Medicare paid approximately $12.8 million for return trips to nursing facilities on a single day.  Lastly, contrary to Federal regulations, Medicare paid approximately $6.6 million for services ordered by nonphysicians.</p>
<p>We  recommend that CMS (1) take appropriate action on portable x-ray suppliers referred by OIG, (2) establish a process to periodically identify portable x-ray suppliers that merit greater scrutiny and follow up as appropriate, (3) determine what portion of the $12.8 million it paid for return trips in 2009 actually reimbursed suppliers for incorrectly billed transportation component claims and collect any overpayments, (4) collect the $6.6 million in overpayments it made for portable x-ray services rendered in 2009 that were ordered by nonphysicians, and (5) implement procedures to ensure that it pays for portable x-ray services only when they are ordered by a physician and establish appropriate controls.  CMS concurred with our recommendations. </p>
