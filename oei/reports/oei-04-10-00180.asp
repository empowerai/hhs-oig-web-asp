<h2 class="line">Summary</h2>


<h3>WHY WE DID THIS STUDY </h3>

<p>Between 2001 and 2010, Medicare payments for Part B goods and services increased by 43 percent, from $77 billion to $110 billion.  During this same time, Medicare payments for evaluation and management (E/M) services increased by 48 percent, from $22.7 billion to $33.5 billion.  E/M services have been vulnerable to fraud and abuse.  In 2009, two health care entities paid over $10 million to settle allegations that they fraudulently billed Medicare for E/M services.  CMS also found that certain types of E/M services had the most improper payments of all Medicare Part B service types in 2008.  This report is the first in a series of evaluations of E/M services.  Subsequent evaluations will determine the appropriateness of Medicare payments for E/M services and the extent of documentation vulnerabilities in E/M services.  </p> 

<h3>HOW WE DID THIS STUDY</h3>

<p>Using the Part B Analytics Reporting System, we analyzed E/M services provided to beneficiaries to determine coding trends from 2001 to 2010.  Using Part B Medicare claims data, we analyzed physicians' E/M claims to identify physicians who consistently billed higher level (i.e., more complex and more expensive) E/M codes in 2010.  We did not determine whether the E/M claims from these physicians were inappropriate. </p>

<h3>WHAT WE FOUND</h3>

<p>From 2001 to 2010, physicians increased their billing of higher level E/M codes in all types of E/M services.  Among these physicians, we identified approximately 1,700 who consistently billed higher level E/M codes in 2010.  Although these physicians differed from others in their billing of E/M codes, they practiced in nearly all States and represented similar specialties.  The physicians who consistently billed higher level E/M codes also treated beneficiaries of similar ages and with similar diagnoses as those treated by other physicians.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE RECOMMEND</h3>

<p>CMS concurred with our recommendations to (1) continue to educate physicians on proper billing for E/M services and (2) encourage its contractor to review physicians' billing for E/M services.  CMS partially concurred with our third recommendation, to review physicians who bill higher level E/M codes for appropriate action. </p>
