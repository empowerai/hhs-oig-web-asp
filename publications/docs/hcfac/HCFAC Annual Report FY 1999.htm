      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    </center>
  </H1>
  <HR width="70%">
  <P>The detection and elimination of health care fraud and abuse is a top priority 
    of federal law enforcement. Our efforts to combat fraud were consolidated 
    and strengthened considerably by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
    Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse 
    Control Program (the Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney General 
    and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<A href="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, 
    acting through the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed to coordinate 
    federal, state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health 
    care fraud and abuse. HIPAA brought much needed and powerful new criminal 
    and civil enforcement tools and financial resources that permitted the government 
    to expand and intensify the fight against health care fraud. 
  <P>The third year of operation under the Program saw a continuation of the collaborative 
    efforts of Federal and state enforcement and oversight agencies to identify 
    and prosecute the most egregious instances of health care fraud, to prevent 
    future fraud or abuse, and to protect program beneficiaries. 
  <P><STRONG>Civil and Criminal Enforcement Actions</STRONG> 
  <P>Federal prosecutors filed 371 criminal indictments in health care fraud cases 
    in 1999 -- a 16 percent increase over the previous year. A total of 396 defendants 
    were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes in 1999. There were also 
    2,278 civil matters pending, and 91 civil cases filed in 1999. 
  <P><STRONG>Monetary Results</STRONG> 
  <P>In 1999, the federal government won or negotiated more than $524 million 
    in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care fraud 
    cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well as prior year 
    judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the federal government 
    in 1999 collected $490 million. It should be noted that some of the judgments, 
    settlements, and administrative impositions in 1999 will result in collections 
    in future years, just as some of the collections in 1999 are attributable 
    to actions from prior years. 
  <P>Nearly $369 million of the funds collected and disbursed in 1999 were returned 
    to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional $4.7 million was recovered as the 
    federal share of Medicaid restitution. 
  <P><STRONG>Exclusion from Federally Sponsored Programs</STRONG> 
  <P>HIPAA expanded and strengthened the government's ability to prohibit companies 
    or individuals who have been convicted of certain health care offenses, lost 
    their licenses, or engaged in other professional misconduct from participating 
    in Medicare, Medicaid or other federally sponsored health care programs. In 
    1999, HHS excluded 2,976 individuals and entities. 
  <P><STRONG>Collaboration</STRONG> 
  <P>One of the fundamental principals of the Program is to maximize the effectiveness 
    and efficiency of law enforcement efforts by promoting information sharing 
    and collaboration among the many federal, state and local allies in the fight 
    against health care fraud.<STRONG> </STRONG>Such collaboration has increased 
    during 1999, through heightened data sharing, establishment of a National 
    Health Care Fraud Task Force chaired by the Deputy Attorney General (bringing 
    together federal, state, and local prosecutors and other enforcement officials) 
    and joint training, to name a few. In addition to the many joint health care 
    investigations undertaken daily across the country, collaborative efforts 
    have also produced effective new beneficiary outreach initiatives, and fraud 
    prevention efforts. 
  <P><STRONG>Preventing Health Care Fraud</STRONG> 
  <P>Preventing health care fraud and abuse is a central component of the Program. 
    The Program's prevention efforts include the promulgation of formal advisory 
    opinions to industry on proposed business practices, industry-specific program 
    compliance guidance, special fraud alerts, corporate integrity agreements 
    with providers who settle allegations of fraud, and beneficiary and provider 
    education and outreach. Fraud prevention and compliance efforts are reaping 
    significant results; the most recent audit of the Medicare payment error rates 
    showed a $10.6 billion or 45 percent drop in improper fee-for-service payments 
    over the last two years. 
  <P><STRONG>Administrative Penalties for "Patient Dumping"</STRONG> 
  <P>The government expanded its efforts under the Patient Anti-Dumping Statute, 
    which requires hospitals' emergency departments to provide emergency medical 
    screening and stabilizing treatment, entering settlement agreements with 60 
    hospitals and physicians, and received one default judgment for a total of 
    61 individuals and entities -- up from a previous high of 53 settlements in 
    1998. The Government collected $1.725 million in civil monetary penalties 
    associated with these cases.

      Section 1817(k)(5) of the Social Security Act</strong>

  <P> 
    <CENTER>
      <STRONG><U><FONT size=+1>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</FONT></U></STRONG>
    </CENTER>
  <P> 
  <P>The Social Security Act Section 1128C(a), as established by the Health Insurance 
    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA or the Act), 
    created the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (the Program), a far-reaching 
    program to combat fraud and abuse in health care, including both public and 
    private health plans. 
  <P>The Act requires that an amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations 
    -- including criminal fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, 
    and administrative penalties, but excluding restitution, compensation to the 
    victim agency, and relators' shares -- be deposited in the Medicare<A href="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
    Trust Fund. All funds deposited in the Trust Fund as a result of the Act are 
    available for the operations of the Trust Fund. 
  <P>As stated above, the Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund 
    to a newly created expenditure account, called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse 
    Control Account (the Account), in amounts that the Secretary and Attorney 
    General jointly certify are necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. The 
    maximum amounts available for expenditure are specified in the Act. Certain 
    of these sums are to be available only for activities of the HHS/OIG, with 
    respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 1999, the third year of the 
    Program, the Secretary and the Attorney General certified $137.5 million for 
    appropriation to the Account. A detailed breakdown of the allocation of these 
    funds is set forth later in this report. These resources supplement the direct 
    appropriations of HHS and DOJ that are devoted to health care fraud enforcement. 
    (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received $66 million 
    from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.) 
  <P>Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the 
    Program's goals are: 
  <P>(1) to coordinate federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating 
    to health care fraud and abuse; 
  <P>(2) to conduct investigations, audits, and evaluations relating to the delivery 
    of and payment for health care in the United States; 
  <P>(3) to facilitate enforcement of all applicable remedies for such fraud; 
  <P>(4) to provide guidance to the health care industry regarding fraudulent 
    practices; and 
  <P>(5) to establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse 
    actions against health care providers. 
  <P>The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit a joint 
    annual report to the Congress which identifies: 
  <P>(A) the amounts appropriated to the HI Trust Fund for the previous fiscal 
    year under various categories and the source of such amounts; and 
  <P>(B) the amounts appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use by 
    the Attorney General and the Secretary and the justification for the expenditure 
    of such amounts. 
  <P>This annual report is submitted in fulfillment of the above statutory requirements.

  As required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the amounts 
  deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source of such 
  deposits. In 1999, as a result of the combined anti-fraud actions of the federal 
  and state governments and others, the federal government collected $490 million 
  in connection with health care fraud cases and matters<A href="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>. 
  These funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA), transferred to other federal agencies administering

  <H3>Accomplishments</H3>
  <P><STRONG>Collections</STRONG> 
  <P>During this year, the federal government won or negotiated more than $524 
    million in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health 
    care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well 
    as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the 
    federal government in 1999 collected $490 million in cases resulting from 
    health care fraud and abuse, of which nearly $369 million was returned to 
    the Medicare Trust Fund, and $4.7 million was recovered as the federal share 
    of Medicaid restitution. It should be emphasized that some of the judgments, 
    settlements, and administrative impositions in 1999 will result in collections 
    in future years, just as some of the collections in 1999 are attributable 
    to actions from prior years. 
  <P> 
  <P><STRONG>Judgments/Settlements</STRONG> 
  <P>Working together, we have brought to successful conclusion the investigation 
    and prosecution of numerous costly health care fraud schemes. Among them, 
    are the following. 
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>A major provider of home health services and one of its subsidiaries entered 
      into a global settlement totaling $61 million, including approximately $10 
      million in criminal fines, to resolve the corporation's criminal, civil, 
      and administrative liability arising from Medicare fraud investigations 
      in Georgia, Florida, and New York. In Georgia and Florida, the investigation 
      examined a series of transactions in which the home health services corporation 
      paid another large health care corporation for the right to provide Medicare-reimbursable 
      management services to that corporation. These payments included large cash 
      contributions to the other corporation, enabling it to purchase home health 
      agencies of third parties. In consideration of these payments, and of an 
      agreement by the defendant to sell its own home health agencies to the other 
      corporation at a reduced price, the defendant received the right to manage 
      the visits resulting from these transactions for a management fee which 
      was fully reimbursed by Medicare. The effect of these transactions was to 
      disguise non-reimbursable acquisition costs as management fees, which Medicare 
      does not reimburse. As a result of this investigation, the subsidiary pled 
      guilty to conspiracy, mail fraud, and violation of the Medicare anti-kickback 
      statute in three districts. In New York, a separate investigation focused 
      on allegations that the corporation submitted unallowable expenses on its 
      Medicare cost reports, including personal expenses of executives, gifts 
      and entertainment, and merger costs. In addition to paying $61 million, 
      the corporation entered into a comprehensive corporate integrity agreement 
      with the Government. </LI>
  </UL>
  <UL>
    <P> 
    <LI>In Pennsylvania, a company providing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) services 
      through a network of subsidiary corporations it had acquired, agreed to 
      pay the Government $16.5 million to resolve allegations of false Medicare 
      claims submitted by one of the subsidiaries. The claims arose from the sale 
      of Medicare-reimbursable noninvasive diagnostic tests between 1992 and 1995. 
      The subsidiary companies provided financial inducements to primary care 
      physicians and to renal dialysis facilities in exchange for the referral 
      of patients for diagnostic testing. As a result, a percentage of the tests 
      performed by the subsidiaries were medically unnecessary. The final settlement

    <LI>A key component of the HCFAC effort to protect the integrity of the Medicare 
      trust funds is the investigation of allegations of fraud by contractors 
      enlisted by HCFA to process and pay Medicare claims. Stemming from a <EM>qui 
      tam</EM> complaint filed in New Mexico, two former Medicare contractors 
      agreed to settle their False Claims Act, criminal, and administrative liability 
      for misrepresenting their performance. In order to resolve allegations of 
      manipulating certain computer files to obtain a better score on the Contractor 
      Performance Evaluation Program, one of the corporations agreed to pay the 
      Government $6.84 million. On or after May 1, 2001, the United States may, 
      at its sole discretion, demand that the other corporation pay the Government 
      $5.86 million, after considering the corporation's financial condition, 
      for attempting to conceal evidence of poor performance on their audits of 
      Medicare Part A providers. In addition, both corporations will forgo contract 
      claims for overbudget and termination costs totaling $3.1 million. Both 
      corporations also entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with 
      the OIG. In addition, as part of the global settlement, the former contractors 
      pled guilty to obstruction of a Federal audit and conspiracy to obstruct 
      a Federal audit. A third corporation, co-owned by the contractors to provide 
      them with management services, pled guilty to conspiring to obstruct a Federal 
      audit as well. The United States should ultimately receive $15.8 million 
      in criminal fines, the civil settlement, and the contract claims. </LI>

    <LI>On October 15, 1998, the United States reached an agreement with a major 
      metropolitan fire department and a local hospital corporation to resolve 
      allegations in a <EM>qui tam</EM> complaint that the defendants routinely 
      had submitted false claims to the United States to obtain reimbursement 
      for medically unnecessary ambulance transportation. The city agreed to pay 
      the Government $9.5 million. Among other things, the complaint alleged that 
      the fire department misrepresented the diagnosis of patients in order to 
      receive reimbursement from Medicare for ambulance transportation. As part 
      of the settlement, the company entered into a comprehensive institutional 
      compliance agreement which will be monitored and enforced by the HHS/OIG 
      for the next 5 years. </LI>
  </UL>
  <P>These and other settlements reflect the culmination of investigations that 
    have been ongoing for several years. Though settled in 1999, the fines and 
    restitution generated by some of these cases will not be credited to the Medicare 
    Trust Funds until 2000. 
  <P><STRONG>Collaboration</STRONG> 
  <P>Effective health care fraud and abuse control requires close collaboration 
    and regular exchanges of information among federal, state and local law enforcement 
    entities. Shown here are a few of the many instances of collaborative effort 
    between DOJ, HHS, and many other organizations involved in combating health 
    care fraud. 
  <P> 
  <DD><STRONG>National Health Care Fraud Task Force.</STRONG> In 1999, the Administration 
    launched a new National Health Care Fraud Task Force, chaired by the Deputy 
    Attorney General, in which HHS/OIG, HCFA, DOJ and State and local prosecutors 
    will work together in formulating strategies to combat health care fraud and 
    abuse and safeguard the well-being of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. 
    While the task force will focus on a wide range of health care fraud and abuse 
    policy issues, particular attention will be devoted to fighting nursing home 
    fraud and abuse and excluding dishonest and abusive providers from participation 
    in Medicare, Medicaid and other Government-funded health care programs. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Nursing Homes.</STRONG> The destructive impact of fraudulent billing 
    is not measured in dollars only. During 1999, the Program continued to pursue 
    investigations, prosecutions, audits and evaluations that directly affect 
    not only financial losses, but also the <EM>quality</EM> of care provided 
    to Medicare, Medicaid and other beneficiaries of government funded health 
    care programs. Quality of care in nursing homes has been identified as a priority 
    for both DOJ and HHS; and in October 1998, DOJ launched a major new initiative 
    to crack down on fraud, abuse and neglect in nursing homes and other residential 
    care facilities. The Nursing Home Initiative, coordinated by the Civil Division, 
    focuses on enhanced enforcement; training; outreach to industry, resident 
    advocates, medical professionals, academics and others; new legislation to 
    address gaps in federal law; an analysis of the applicable state laws and 
    improved inter-agency and governmental coordination, use of data, and services 
    to victims. 
    <P>DOJ began a series of regional training conferences in 1999 that brought 
      together representatives of federal, state, and local law enforcement, regulatory, 
      survey, oversight and advocacy entities. During the conferences, State Working 
      Groups (SWG) were formed (or expanded where they existed), including representatives 
      of the many entities that play a role in nursing home quality of care. These 
      SWGs provide an on-going opportunity to promote quality of care by establishing 
      a forum for key players to meet, share information and skills, identify 
      problem facilities, best practices, and ways to address quality of care 
      given the unique situations in the various states. 
    <P>These and other investigative initiatives complement HCFA's ongoing Nursing 
      Home Initiative, which has already resulted in significant improvements 
      to nursing home oversight, enforcement and quality monitoring. Communication 
      and coordination are facilitated by monthly Nursing Home Steering Committee 
      meetings attended by the Civil Division, Criminal Division, Civil Rights 
      Division, FBI, HHS/OIG, HCFA, HHS/OGC as well as in Senior Staff and Executive 
      Level policy meetings during which nursing home fraud, abuse and neglect 
      are among the health care issues addressed. 
    <P>Examples of investigations of nursing homes for false claims relating to 
      the quality of care provided to their residents that were brought to successful 
      conclusion in 1999 include: 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>A survey by the state Department of Health of a Pennsylvania nursing 
        home disclosed inadequate wound care, incontinence care and nutrition. 
        After investigation, the nursing home entered a settlement agreement with 
        the government, agreeing to pay $195,000, to implement specific quality 
        of care protocols, and to appoint a monitor to oversee the quality of 
        patient care. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>In Kansas, a therapy service provider agreed to pay the Government $688,996 
        to settle allegations of impropriety in providing services to nursing 
        home patients. It was alleged that the provider billed for therapy that 
        was medically unnecessary and excessive, as well as billed for staff education 
        inappropriately, and overbilled for applications of splints and positioning 
        of patients. As part of the settlement, the provider agreed to adhere 
        to a 3-year comprehensive corporate integrity agreement. </LI>
    </UL>
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Beneficiary Outreach.</STRONG> On February 24, 1999, the HHS/OIG, 
    DOJ, HCFA, and the Administration on Aging (AoA) joined with the American 
    Association for Retired Persons (AARP) to launch an initiative against Medicare 
    fraud, waste, and abuse. The educational campaign -- entitled "Who Pays? You 
    Pay. Report Medicare Fraud" -- was held in 31 cities throughout the country, 
    and was attended by approximately 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Outreach 
    materials developed for the campaign include a brochure, entitled "What You 
    Can Do To Stop Medicare Fraud" in English and Spanish, a drain-image poster 
    entitled "Medicare Fraud is Money Down the Drain", and a 30-second public 
    service announcement. The award-winning announcement was produced by AARP 
    and is shown under the logos of AARP and HHS. 
    <P> 
    <P>Since the campaign kick-off, the collaborative partnership between HHS/OIG, 
      HCFA, AoA, DOJ, and AARP has continued. Monthly meetings are held to update 
      partners on the activities of each respective partner and to plan for future 
      collaborative activities. Since the event, the HHS/OIG Hotline 1-800-HHS-TIPS, 
      has served as an educational and reporting resource to approximately 300,000 
      callers (up from 76,000 calls in 1998). The Hotline has also experienced 
      a spike in calls from Puerto Rico and has established an active monitoring 
      and evaluation system to ensure that concerns of the Hispanic community 
      are addressed. To address this call increase, the Hotline has hired an additional 
      Spanish-speaking representative and has increased the number of Spanish 
      representatives at the contractor site in Chicago. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Data Sharing.</STRONG> In 1999, efforts continued to share information 
    &shy; both general data about trends in health care fraud and emerging investigative 
    and prosecutorial techniques -- and to communicate and coordinate with respect 
    to specific investigations. A general data sharing process was instituted 
    between the FBI and the HHS/OIG to ensure that complete, accurate and current 
    information on Federal health care fraud investigations is maintained and 
    readily accessible by both agencies. 
    <P><STRONG>Preventing Health Care Fraud</STRONG> 
    <P>The Program also continues to focus on <EM>prevention</EM> of health care 
      fraud and abuse through inclusion of rigorous corporate integrity provisions 
      in settlements with alleged offenders, industry-specific program compliance 
      guidance, formal advisory opinions, special fraud alerts, beneficiary outreach, 
      and exclusions from program participation. These activities, coupled with 
      the overall sentinel effect of our heightened enforcement efforts have netted 
      real results. Perhaps the most concrete evidence of the success of anti-fraud 
      and oversight efforts is the significant reduction in the error rates in 
      Medicare fee-for-service payments &shy; an overall 45 percent reduction 
      in improper payments in just 2 years. As part of the HHS/OIG audit of HHS's 
      1996 financial statements, HHS/OIG developed a statistically valid estimate 
      of improper payments amounting to $23.2 billion, or about 14 percent of 
      the total payments made in the fiscal year. Just 2 years later, improper 
      payments dropped by $10.6 billion to $12.6 billion, or about 7 percent of 
      the fiscal year total. 
    <P>According to Treasury Department and Congressional Budget Office statistics, 
      Medicare spending rose at an average annual rate of about 9 percent from 
      1994 to 1997, then dropped to 1.5 percent in 1998 -- the smallest increase 
      in the history of the program. 1998 also marked the first year that Medicare 
      spending grew more slowly than the Federal budget as a whole, which increased 
      by 3 percent. This downward trend is continuing; during 1999, Medicare spending 
      actually declined 0.7 percent. Even home health care expenditures, which 
      experienced explosive growth during most of the 1990's, declined. The Medicare 
      Trustees recently announced that the solvency of the Trust Fund had been 
      extended 7 years to 2015, after also being extended 7 years the prior year. 
    <P>A more detailed description of these and other accomplishments of the major 
      federal participants in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA follows. 
      While information in this report is presented in the context of a single 
      agency, most of these accomplishments reflect the combined efforts of HHS, 
      DOJ and other partners in the anti-fraud efforts. The continuing accomplishments 
      of the DOJ and HHS and our partners in the coordinated anti-fraud effort, 
      as well as prevention efforts, demonstrate that the increased funds to battle 
      health care fraud and abuse continue to be sound investments, as well as 
      good public policy. <A name=e>&nbsp;</A>

    <P> 
    <P>Certain of the funds appropriated under HIPAA are, by statute, set aside 
      for Medicare and Medicaid activities of the HHS/OIG. During the third year 
      of the Program, the Act provides that between $90 and $100 million be devoted 
      to these purposes. The Secretary and the Attorney General jointly allotted 
      $98.2 million to the HHS/OIG in 1999, an increase of $12 million over 1998. 
    <P>With these increased resources, HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 942 
      prosecutions or settlements in 1999. A total of 2,976 individuals and entities 
      were also excluded, many as a result of criminal convictions for program-related 
      crimes (550), criminal convictions for patient abuse or neglect (323), and 
      others were excluded based on licensure revocations (1,416). 
    <P>In addition to the HHS/OIG's role in bringing about the judgments and settlements 
      described in the Overview of Accomplishments, the Department of Health and 
      Human Services acted on HHS/OIG recommendations and disallowed $113.5 million 
      in improperly paid health care funds in 1999. HHS/OIG continues to work 
      with HCFA to develop and implement recommendations to correct systemic vulnerabilities 
      detected during HHS/OIG evaluations and audits. These corrective actions 
      often result in health care funds not expended (that is, funds put to better 
      use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG initiatives). In 1999, such funds 
      not expended on improper or unnecessary care amounted to approximately $11.8 
      billion -- about $10.8 billion in Medicare savings, and nearly $1 billion 
      in savings to the Medicaid program. 
    <P> 
    <P>HHS/OIG moved closer to its goal of extending its investigative and audit 
      staffs to cover <EM>all</EM> geographical areas in the country, particularly 
      those that were previously underserved. During 1999, overall HHS/OIG staff 
      levels increased from 1,258 to 1,363 by the end of the year, and HHS/OIG 
      opened 2 new investigative offices. The HHS/OIG also significantly increased 
      its staffing resources devoted to ensuring health care providers' compliance 
      with Federal health care program rules. 
    <P><STRONG>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</STRONG> 
    <P>The increased resources made available under HIPAA have enabled the HHS/OIG 
      to expand activities designed not just to uncover existing fraud and abuse, 
      but to <EM>prevent</EM> it. Vital prevention initiatives, such as those 
      listed below, inform and assist the health care industry, and patients. 
      Equally important, these prevention activities reduce the government's enforcement 
      costs and program losses. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Compliance Guidance. </STRONG>A key element of HHS/OIG's prevention 
    efforts has been the development of compliance program guidance to encourage 
    and assist the private health care industry to fight fraud and abuse. The 
    guidance, developed in conjunction with the provider community, identifies 
    steps that health providers may voluntarily take to improve adherence to Medicare 
    and Medicaid rules. In 1999, the OIG developed and released final compliance 
    program guidance for third party medical billing companies, hospices and the 
    durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and suppliers industry. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Corporate Integrity Agreements</STRONG>. Many health care providers 
    that enter agreements with the government in settlement of potential liability 
    for violations of the False Claims Act also agree to adhere to a separate 
    "corporate integrity agreement." Under this agreement, the provider commits 
    to establishing a compliance program or undertaking other specified steps 
    to ensure its future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules. The duration 
    of most corporate integrity agreements is 5 years, during which time the provider 
    must submit periodic reports to HHS/OIG. These agreements require a substantial 
    effort by the provider to ensure that the organization is operating in accordance 
    with Federal health care programs rules and regulations and the parameters 
    established by the corporate integrity agreement. Breach of the agreement 
    may result in a variety of sanctions, including exclusion of the provider. 
    At the close of 1999, HHS/OIG was monitoring more than 425 corporate integrity 
    agreements. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Industry Guidance. </STRONG>The centerpiece of the HIPAA guidance 
    initiatives is an advisory opinion process through which parties can obtain 
    binding legal guidance as to whether their existing or proposed health care 
    business transactions run afoul of the Federal anti-kickback statute, the 
    civil money penalties laws, or the exclusion provisions. The advisory opinion 
    process has become an integral part of the Inspector General's ongoing commitment 
    to preventing health care fraud. During 1999, the HHS/OIG accepted 39 requests 
    for advisory opinions and issued 15 opinions. Many requests are still being 
    processed; others were withdrawn or rejected as outside the scope of the advisory 
    opinion process. 
    <P>The advisory opinion process also serves to enhance the HHS/OIG's understanding 
      of new and emerging health care business arrangements and informed the development 
      of new safe harbor regulations, fraud alerts, and special advisory bulletins. 
      Topics so addressed in 1999 include hospital payments to physicians to reduce 
      or limit services to beneficiaries (commonly known as "gainsharing" arrangements); 
      the effect of exclusion from Federal health care programs on excluded providers 
      and those who employ or contract with them; physician liability for certifications 
      of medical necessity in the provision of medical equipment and home health 
      services; and the effects of exclusion from Federal health care programs 
      on current and prospective employees. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG made significant strides toward resolving pending safe harbor 
      regulations. Formal clearance was begun for a proposed anti-kickback safe 
      harbor for ambulance restocking arrangements between hospitals and ambulance 
      providers who transport patients to hospital emergency rooms and a proposed 
      safe harbor under the civil money penalty law for inducements to beneficiaries 
      to protect certain payments by ESRD facilities of insurance premiums for 
      their patients. Two final anti-kickback statute safe harbor rules were finalized 
      for issuance in early 2000 -- one promulgating eight new safe harbors and 
      a series of clarifications to existing safe harbors (originally proposed 
      in 1993 and 1994), and another addressing the statutory exception for shared 
      risk arrangements. 
    <P>In addition, HHS/OIG has made frequent presentations to industry groups 
      on areas of suspected fraud and abuse and measures they can take to avoid 
      trouble. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Medicare Error Rate: </STRONG>The HHS/OIG's annual audit of the 
    Department's financial statements included a statistically valid review of 
    the error rate in Medicare fee-for-service payments. This year's estimate 
    is $7.7 billion less than last year's estimate of $20.3 billion and $10.6 
    billion less than the previous year's estimate of $23.2 billion--a 45 percent 
    drop. While there is no empirical evidence supporting a specific causal relationship 
    between the error rate decline and particular corrective actions, we believe 
    that among the important causes for the reduced error rate are the fraud and 
    abuse prevention and detection initiatives, the Medicare Integrity Program 
    administered by HCFA and the cooperative efforts of major provider groups. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Recommendations for Systemic Improvements: </STRONG>Frequently, 
    investigations (and resulting civil settlements or criminal prosecutions), 
    audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or incentives for fraud in agency 
    programs or administrative processes. As required by the Inspector General 
    Act, the HHS/OIG makes recommendations to correct these vulnerabilities, and 
    thereby promote economy and efficiency in HHS programs and operations. Relying 
    on the independent factual information generated by HHS/OIG, agency managers 
    fashion legislative proposals and other corrective actions that, when enacted 
    or implemented, close loopholes and avoid ineffective expenditures or improper 
    conduct. The net savings from these joint efforts toward program improvements 
    can be substantial. 
    <P>An example of an HHS/OIG study that provided evidence and ideas supporting 
      proposals for significant cost savings issued during 1999 was the series 
      of reports on the early effects of the prospective payment system (PPS) 
      on access to skilled nursing facilities and the appropriateness of Medicare 
      payments for physical and occupational therapy in skilled nursing facilities. 
      The studies found that there are no serious problems in placing Medicare 
      beneficiaries in nursing homes; however, nursing homes are changing their 
      admission practices in response to the new PPS. One-fifth of the hospital 
      discharge planners say that it has become more difficult to place patients 
      who require extensive services while it has become easier to place patients 
      who need rehabilitation services. Most nursing home patients were appropriate 
      candidates for and benefitted from the physical and occupational therapy 
      they received. However, 13 percent of the therapy was improperly billed 
      to Medicare. In terms of dollar amounts, Medicare reimbursed skilled nursing 
      facilities almost $1 billion for improperly billed physical and occupational 
      therapy and almost $331 million for undocumented physical and occupational 
      therapy. 
    <P>The reports recommended that HCFA instruct Medicare fiscal intermediaries 
      to provide more training to facility and therapy staff on Medicare coverage 
      criteria and guidelines, local medical review policies, and monitoring procedures 
      for therapy and adequately fund Medicare contractors to perform medical 
      reviews of therapy. 
    <P><STRONG>Focus on Collaboration</STRONG> 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Federal-State Audit Partnership</STRONG>. In 1994, the HHS/OIG initiated 
    a partnership between federal and state auditors to enhance and provide broader 
    audit coverage of the Medicaid program. Collaboration among HHS/OIG, State 
    auditors, inspectors general, Medicaid agencies and HCFA maximizes scarce 
    resources at both the Federal and State levels. The focus of the partnership 
    effort is not on the traditional identification and recovery of unallowable 
    Medicaid costs; rather the program focuses on identifying program improvements 
    and reducing the cost of providing necessary services to Medicaid recipients. 
    HHS/OIG auditors provide computer support, audit programs and guides, training, 
    information-sharing and other specialized assistance to State auditors, as 
    well as direct audit support. 
    <P>To date, active partnerships flourish in 22 states. This partnership effort 
      has been a resounding success. State auditors have shown a great interest 
      in creating partnerships and we continue to get inquiries on other potential 
      joint projects. By the end of 1999, these State partnerships generated approximately 
      $145 million in Federal and State savings since the partnership began. Many 
      of these recommendations related to Medicaid prescription drugs. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Roundtable on Compliance</STRONG>. In conjunction with the health 
    care industry, the HHS/OIG conducted a joint roundtable on health care compliance 
    to gain new insights into the challenges of creating effective compliance 
    programs. The event reflects HHS/OIG's commitment to engage in ongoing discussions 
    with the health care compliance industry about practices and policies related 
    to compliance programs, including the impact of compliance recommendations 
    advanced by HHS/OIG. More than 125 compliance officers, government representatives 
    and others attended the event. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Self-Disclosure Protocol</STRONG>. In October 1998, the HHS/OIG 
    implemented a self-disclosure program, to assist providers and suppliers in 
    investigating and reporting potential violations of Federal health care laws. 
    The program offers providers an opportunity to police themselves, correct 
    underlying problems and work cooperatively to resolve these matters. Since 
    issuance of the protocol, 40 health care providers have submitted self-disclosures 
    to the HHS/OIG. Two of these were successfully resolved through the return 
    of overpayments to the Federal Government; the others are under investigation. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Data Sharing.</STRONG> With the increased focus on investigations 
    that are national in scope, close collaboration among investigative and prosecutive 
    agencies has become critical. To this end, the HHS/OIG Office of Investigations 
    and the FBI have initiated an efficient information sharing system. Copies 
    of all healthcare fraud referrals and allegations received by HHS/OIG are 
    sent to the FBI Health Care Fraud Unit at FBI Headquarters. The FBI then serves 
    as an informational contact and dissemination point for DOJ and its prosecutors 
    nationwide. In turn, the FBI provides information on their health care investigative 
    matters to HHS/OIG. All such cases, wherever generated, are entered into the 
    HHS/OIG Case Information Management System, which serves as a comprehensive 
    data base for Federal health care investigations. This prompt information 
    sharing system fosters efficient investigative teamwork, supports criminal 
    prosecutions and deters health care fraud. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Beneficiary Outreach</STRONG>. The HHS/OIG's outreach efforts are 
    not limited to industry; equally important is enlisting the beneficiary population 
    in the fight against fraud and abuse. The HHS/OIG continues to distribute 
    hundreds of its Medicare fraud educational materials to beneficiaries through 
    AoA grantees, the AoA network, AARP regional offices, and to public libraries 
    in each State. HHS/OIG has developed a working relationship with national 
    Asian American and Hispanic organizations to seek advice on translating and 
    printing HHS/OIG Medicare fraud materials into Chinese, and to distribute 
    these materials and those already printed in Spanish, respectively, to Chinese 
    Americans and a wider Spanish-speaking population. 
    <P><STRONG>Focus on Quality of Care</STRONG> 
    <P>Some of the HHS/OIG's most important investigations, audits and evaluations 
      focused on the <EM>quality</EM> of care furnished to program beneficiaries. 
      These include the investigations described in the Overview section of this 
      report, as well as the following activities: 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Patient Anti-Dumping Enforcement</STRONG>. Both HCFA and the HHS/OIG 
    continue to vigorously pursue potential violations under the patient anti-dumping 
    statute. Federal law requires that an emergency medical screening examination 
    and stabilizing treatment be provided by the emergency department of a Medicare 
    participating hospital. In 1999, HHS/OIG entered 61 settlement agreements 
    with hospitals and physicians and collected civil monetary penalties of $1.7 
    million. This is an increase from the previous high of 53 settlements in 1998, 
    and reflects the commitment of both HCFA and HHS/OIG to ensure patient access

  <DD><STRONG>Quality of Care in Nursing Homes</STRONG>. The HHS/OIG released 
    a series of inspection reports concluding that serious problems with quality 
    of care continue to exist in nursing homes. This is demonstrated by an increase 
    in survey and certification "quality of care" deficiencies as well as an increase 
    in ombudsman complaints, especially about resident care. Other findings include 
    inadequate nursing home staffing levels; weaknesses in the survey system; 
    inadequate resources in the ombudsman program; and inconsistent and unreliable 
    State systems to safeguard nursing home residents. The problems described 
    in this inspection will require continuing attention. An effective strategy 
    would include actions to enhance the survey and certification process; strengthen 
    the ombudsman program with increased resources; improve nursing home staffing 
    levels; and improve coordination between State survey agencies and ombudsmen. 
    Additionally, further evaluation and performance measurement of the Omnibus 
    Budget Reconciliation Act 1987 and the conditions in nursing homes would make 
    an important contribution to efforts to advance nursing home care. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Hospital Quality Oversight</STRONG>. A two-year study by the HHS/OIG 
    found major deficiencies in the external oversight system intended to make 
    sure the nation's hospitals are safe and recommended how those agencies responsible 
    for oversight can provide leadership in improving quality and accountability. 
    The study received significant national media attention when it was released. 
    Four evaluation reports assessed the key roles in hospital quality oversight 
    played by the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 
    the State survey and certification agencies, and HCFA, which oversees Medicare. 
    Overall, the reports concluded that while the system of oversight that HCFA 
    relies upon has some strengths, it also has deficiencies that warrant serious 
    attention. The HCFA does little at present to hold either the Joint Commission 
    or the State survey agencies accountable for their performance. 
    <P>The reports called for HCFA to exert leadership in addressing the shortcomings. 
      The HHS/OIG urged HCFA to steer the external review process so that it represented 
      a balance between the educationally oriented approaches of the Joint Commission 
      and the enforcement-oriented approaches of the State agencies. In recommendations, 
      the HHS/OIG presented a number of steps HCFA should take to hold both the 
      Joint Commission and the States more fully accountable for their performance 
      in reviewing hospitals. In addition, the HHS/OIG called for HCFA to determine 
      the appropriate minimum cycle for conducting certification surveys of non-accredited 
      hospitals. Since the publication of the final report, the Joint Commission 
      has made several changes to its review and accreditation process, based 
      on HHS/OIG recommendations, that have made the process more meaningful and 
      more accountable.

  <DD><STRONG>Mental Health Services</STRONG>. A settlement agreement was reached 
    with a university to resolve its civil liability for the submission of false 
    claims to Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health care programs from 1992 
    through 1997. At issue were claims for mental health services rendered at 
    its clinics by non-paid, unsupervised students. The university submitted the 
    claims and was reimbursed as if qualified mental health providers (psychologists 
    or psychiatrists) had provided the services. The university agreed to enter 
    a 5-year comprehensive corporate integrity agreement with the HHS/OIG. It 
    also agreed to pay the government a total of over $4 million. Monetary payment 
    will be made to the federal government for both the Medicare damages and the 
    federal portion of Medicaid damages. However, the State agreed that the university 
    could satisfy its liability for the state share of the Medicaid damages through 
    the provision of services rather than through a cash payment. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG also completed a five-State study of partial hospitalization 
      program services provided in community mental health centers. This program 
      is an intensive outpatient psychiatric program which provides services to 
      acutely ill individuals in order to prevent their hospitalization. Medical 
      reviewers found that over 90 percent of the Medicare payments ($229 million 
      of $252 million) were for unallowable or highly questionable services. Cost 
      reports at selected centers contained significant unallowable and nonreimbursable 
      items. Further, HCFA's enrollment initiative in nine States found that a 
      high percentage of the nearly 700 centers covered did not meet certification 
      requirements to qualify for Medicare payments. To address these problems, 
      HCFA developed a 10-point plan under which approximately 150 centers have 
      already been terminated (this includes voluntary terminations and cessation 
      of business). Instructions were issued to fiscal intermediaries on intensified 
      medical review and provider education. HCFA is also implementing a prospective 
      payment system for partial hospitalization program services, and has started 
      the process of deactivating billing numbers for centers that have not billed 
      Medicare within 6 months. <A name=h>&nbsp;</A>

    <P>The Act mandates that the HHS/OIG and DOJ establish a national health care 
      fraud and abuse data collection program for the reporting and disclosure 
      of certain final adverse actions (excluding settlements in which no findings 
      of liability have been made) taken against health care providers, suppliers, 
      and practitioners. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
      has been authorized to design, implement and operate this program, currently 
      named the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). In 1999, 
      HRSA received $4.4million from the Account to continue development of the 
      HIPDB as an all electronic system that will collect, store and disseminate 
      reports to the law enforcement community and health plans upon request. 
    <P>The Act requires Secretarial rulemaking for certain features of the HIPDB, 
      including access, information dissemination, disclosures to the subjects 
      of reported information and report corrections, and any other optional reporting 
      elements that the Secretary chooses to request. Decisions were made jointly 
      by HHS and DOJ to continue the development of the data base in 1999 in anticipation 
      of the publication of the Final Rule. Final regulations were published in 
      the Federal Register in October1999 and plans are underway to open the data 
      bank in early 2000. 
    <P>Development of the HIPDB has included activities related to data base design 
      specifications, reviews of required hardware and software, modification 
      of physical facilities, and the procurement and installation of equipment. 
      The forms and methods of information to be collected to populate the data 
      base has also been part of the HIPDB development process. Most of the information 
      reported to the HIPDB will come from Federal agencies and State licensing 
      authorities. Data acquisition activities have included working with: DOJ, 
      HCFA, HHS/OIG, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and various 
      health care related and health professional organizations, including those 
      representing Nursing and Chiropractic Licensing Boards. 
    <P>Operations will be supported by charging a fee for searching the data base. 
      When the HIPDB becomes operational, the query fee payment will be collected 
      via an interface with Mellon Bank. To date, more than 2,300 entities have 
      registered to query the HIPDB in anticipation of its opening for operation.

    <P>The Office of the General Counsel's (OGC) headquarters divisions (the Health 
      Care Financing Division and the Business and Administrative Law Division) 
      as well as its 10 regional offices provide legal support consistent with 
      the statutory authority of the HCFAC Program. These OGC components, in partnership 
      with other HHS components --- including HCFA, HHS/OIG and DOJ, work jointly 
      to combat health care fraud and abuse. 
    <P>OGC was allocated $2.3 million in HCFAC funding for 1999. These funds were 
      used primarily for litigation activity, both administrative and judicial. 
      OGC continues to experience an increase in the number of new Program Integrity 
      Litigation items: an approximate increase in new cases for fiscal years 
      1998 and 1999 of 17 and 18 percent, respectively. Pending cases for those 
      fiscal years increased 34 and 14 percent respectively. It is our anticipated 
      new litigation and pending litigation that drives OGC's activities. The 
      bulk of the administrative (non-court) litigation involved: (1) Civil Money 
      Penalties (CMPs) and other sanctions imposed on nursing facilities; (2) 
      revocations, terminations or denials of provider status (especially nursing 
      facilities, home health agencies, as well as Community Mental Health Centers 
      (CMHCs) under the Operation Restore Trust CMHC Initiative); (3) Medicare 
      Secondary Payor (MSP) cases; and, (4) suspensions of Medicare payments to 
      providers and suppliers. The bulk of the court litigation involved MSPs 
      or bankruptcies. The dollars reflected here are not included in the Monetary 
      Results section of this report. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments</STRONG> 
    <P>Within this year's framework of prominent HCFAC themes such as civil and 
      criminal enforcement actions; exclusions from federally sponsored programs; 
      initiatives for preventing health care fraud; administrative penalties for 
      Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and 
      collaborative and outreach efforts, OGC had the following HCFAC accomplishments: 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>OGC's HCFA Division worked with OIG to draft a Special Advisory Bulletin 
        to clarify the applicability of the EMTALA to managed care organizations. 
        That Division also assisted HCFA in its efforts to draft a regulation 
        to clarify the scope of EMTALA so that hospitals will know when their 
        obligations under EMTALA begin and end and whether the obligations under 
        EMTALA apply to hospital inpatients. Other EMTALA efforts included a presentation 
        by Region X staff to the Washington State Bar Association on EMTALA requirements. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>Region V staff assisted in successfully defending against federal district 
        court and bankruptcy court suits seeking to enjoin recoupment of overpayments 
        from a home health agency in Indiana ($5 million) and from a nursing facility 
        ($1 million). </LI>
    </UL>
    <P> 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>Region VI's collaborative and outreach efforts are plentiful and significant: 
        for example, in ongoing collaborative efforts with HCFA, the Texas Department 
        of Human Services and the Texas Attorney General's Office, an action plan 
        to preserve patient health and safety when nursing home chains become 
        insolvent or file for bankruptcy was coordinated. These efforts arose 
        out of the bankruptcy of a Texas nursing home chain where issues of fraud, 
        suspension of payments, patient safety and bankruptcy were all present. 
        As a result, this model will be used in similar OGC efforts in the future. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>Region VI also was successful in protecting HCFA's interests when a 
        nursing home chain in Texas (90 facilities) filed for bankruptcy. Through 
        the efforts of Region VI's staff, HCFA was able to recoup a $3 million 
        cost report overpayment over a 12-month period. Additionally, they were 
        able to arrange for continued repayment of a $885.9 thousand settlement 
        of 29 civil monetary penalty cases. </LI>
    </UL>
    <P> 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>OGC's Region III and Region X offices collaborated with efforts to sustain 
        denial of $4.8 million in payments to a Medicare supplier, headquartered 
        in Pennsylvania, of orthotics and lymphedema pumps. The supplier filed 
        for bankruptcy protection which most likely would have resulted in HCFA 
        (as an unsecured creditor) receiving pennies on the dollars for its claims. 
        However, OGC was able to convince the unsecured creditors' committee that 
        the debtor's claims were fraudulent, and that the appeal of the denial 
        of claims would be fruitless. Medicare was able to retain the $4.8 million 
        as a result of these offices' efforts. </LI>

    <P>In 1999, the Administration on Aging (AoA) was allocated $1.4 million in 
      HCFAC funds to train and educate both paid and volunteer aging network staff 
      to recognize and report potential practices and patterns of fraud, waste, 
      and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These activities were focused 
      on training nursing home ombudsmen, health insurance counselors, state and 
      area agency on aging staff, senior center directors, social workers, eldercare 
      information specialists, and other professionals in 18 states how to identify 
      and report potentially fraudulent practices. 
    <P>This funding also helped to support the technical assistance and nationwide 
      infrastructure for educating beneficiaries to be the "eyes and ears" of 
      the Medicare system. The AoA and its network agencies engaged in coordinated 
      outreach and educational activities designed to assist older persons and 
      their families to recognize and report fraudulent and abusive situations 
      and to prevent or minimize victimization of such behavior.

          brochures, and public information documents designed to recruit volunteers, 
          involve providers in the campaign, and inform beneficiaries of what 
          they should do if they have questions regarding their Explanation of 
          Medicare Benefits Statement or Medicare Summary Notice. Educational 
          materials were developed in a variety of languages, and outreach initiatives 
          were targeted to high-risk populations. The AoA entered into a contract 
          to develop culturally sensitive videos and brochures targeted to the 
          African American, Hispanic, and Chinese communities.

          care waste, fraud, and abuse. Special initiatives were undertaken to 
          include local health care providers in these activities. Two examples 
          of these efforts include the assistance of physicians in developing 
          a personal health care journal that beneficiaries can use to record 
          the services they receive during a doctor or hospital visit, and a collaboration 
          with hospitals in developing and distributing an informational brochure 
          on waste, fraud, and abuse that individuals receive when they are discharged 
          from the hospital.

          than 9,800 calls concerning potential cases of health care fraud, waste, 
          and abuse which were screened by the projects, approximately half were 
          referred to Medicare carriers, intermediaries, or regional durable medical

    <P>Health care fraud involves a variety of schemes that defraud public and 
      private insurers and providers nationwide. In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, 
      a number of federally funded health benefit programs have been the targets 
      of these schemes. The fraudulent activity may include double billing schemes, 
      kickbacks, billing for unnecessary or unperformed tests, or may be related 
      to the quality of care provided to patients. In addition to monetary losses, 
      in some instances these improper activities endanger patient safety. United 
      States Attorneys' offices (USAOs) are responsible for civilly and criminally 
      prosecuting health care professionals, providers, and other specialized 
      business entities who engage in health care fraud and abuse. 
    <P>USAOs continue to strengthen cooperative efforts with federal, state and 
      local law enforcement agencies involved in the prevention, evaluation, detection, 
      and investigation of health care fraud and abuse. In addition to the FBI, 
      HHS/OIG and HCFA, USAOs offices work with State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, 
      Offices of Inspectors General for a number of federal agencies, the Drug 
      Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative 
      Service and TRICARE Support Office. Each USAO has appointed both a civil 
      and criminal health care fraud coordinator to assist in coordination and 
      facilitate communication between federal, state and local law enforcement 
      groups. 
    <P>Over the past year, USAOs have diligently worked to enhance provider understanding 
      of the Department's enforcement responsibilities and efforts. A number of 
      outreach presentations have been made to health care professionals, provider 
      organizations, and beneficiary groups around the country in this regard. 
    <P>Prior to the enactment of HIPAA, USAOs dedicated substantial resources 
      to combating health care fraud and abuse. HIPAA allocations have supplemented 
      these efforts. 
    <P><STRONG>Training</STRONG> 
    <P>The Executive Office for the United States Attorneys' Office of Legal Education 
      (OLE) is tasked with the responsibility for providing health care fraud 
      training for USAO and DOJ attorneys, investigators, and auditors. During 
      1999, OLE conducted a number of courses and presentations on health care 
      fraud, including:

      agency counsel and investigative personnel were also invited to participate 
      as presenters and students. In addition to OLE sponsored training a number 
      of USAO attorneys, auditors and investigators participated in multi-agency 
      health care fraud training courses over the last year. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Criminal Prosecutions</STRONG> 
    <P>The primary objective of criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the 
      integrity of our nation's health care programs and to punish and deter those 
      who, through their improper activities, adversely affect the health care 
      system and the taxpayers. 
    <P>Each time a criminal case is referred to a USAO from the FBI, HHS/OIG, 
      or other law enforcement agency, it is opened as a matter pending in the 
      district. A referral remains a matter until an indictment or information 
      is filed or the case is declined for prosecution. In 1999, the USAOs had 
      1,994 criminal matters pending involving 3,158 defendants, a 6.9 percent 
      increase in the number of criminal matters over 1998. During 1999, 371 cases 
      were filed involving 506 defendants. This represents a 16.3 percent increase 
      over cases filed in 1998. A total of 396 defendants were convicted for health 
      care fraud-related crimes in 1999. Health care fraud convictions include 
      both guilty pleas and guilty verdicts. 
    <P>In one case, 20 individuals were convicted for their involvement in a massive 
      and sophisticated scheme to defraud Medicare. The convictions arose from 
      an almost five-year investigation (conducted by HHS/OIG, FBI, the Internal 
      Revenue Service, and the Department of Labor) of a home health agency, which 
      from 1991 to 1994 was the largest Medicare-certified home health agency 
      in Miami. During that time, the home health agency was paid approximately 
      $120 million by Medicare for reimbursement of services, including nursing 
      and home health aide visits, which either had not been provided, were not 
      necessary, or were provided to persons who were not eligible. In some cases, 
      Medicare was billed for services provided to persons who were already deceased 
      when the billed services were supposedly rendered. The two highest level 
      home health agency administrators admitted to illegal hidden partnerships 
      in literally hundreds of subcontractor groups and the conspirators' involvement 
      in hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payoffs to everyone from 
      "professional beneficiaries" to home health aids, nurses and doctors. The 
      convicted defendants, in what eventually became two separate federal court 
      cases, arising from two separate series of indictments, received sentences 
      ranging from 18 months imprisonment to, in the case of the highest level 
      administrator, 12 years imprisonment. A single defendant returned $1.1 million 
      in fraudulently obtained assets. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Civil Cases</STRONG> 
    <P>Civil health care fraud efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative 
      Civil Enforcement (ACE) activities. The ACE Program helps ensure that federal 
      laws are obeyed and that violators provide compensation to the government 
      for losses and damages they cause. Civil health care fraud matters ordinarily 
      involve the United States utilizing the False Claims Act, as well as common 
      law fraud remedies, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment and conversion 
      to recover damages from those who have submitted false or improper claims 
      to the United States. 
    <P>Each time a civil referral is made to a USAO it is opened as a matter pending 
      in the district. Civil health care fraud matters are referred directly from 
      federal or state investigative agencies, or result from filings by private 
      persons known as "relators," who file suits on behalf of the Federal Government 
      under the 1986 <EM>qui tam</EM> amendments to the False Claims Act. Relators 
      may be entitled to share in the recoveries resulting from these lawsuits. 
      At the end of 1999, the USAOs had 2,278 civil health care fraud matters 
      pending. A matter becomes a case when the United States files a civil complaint, 
      or intervenes in a <EM>qui tam </EM>action, in United States District Court. 
      The vast majority of civil health care fraud cases and matters are settled 
      without a complaint ever being filed. In 1999, 91 civil health care fraud 
      cases were filed. 
    <P>A multimillion dollar settlement was reached with one of the largest home 
      health care companies in Texas, which agreed to pay the Government $10 million 
      to resolve allegations involving its subsidiary, a provider of home health 
      care and infusion therapy services. Allegedly, the subsidiary improperly 
      charged Medicare for unallowable costs including salaries, travel, and legal 
      fees. In addition, the subsidiary allegedly conspired with and caused skilled 
      nursing facilities to overcharge Medicare for infusion therapy drugs, supplies, 
      and nursing services. As part of the settlement, the subsidiary also entered 
      into a comprehensive corporate integrity agreement with HHS/OIG. <A

        Civil Division
      </CENTER>
      </STRONG></FONT> 
    <P>Civil Division attorneys vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care 
      fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors General 
      of HHS and Defense, as well as other federal and state law enforcement agencies. 
      Cases involve health care providers, carriers and fiscal intermediaries 
      that defraud Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. 
    <P>The Department's Nursing Home Initiative, launched in October 1998 to crack 
      down on fraud, abuse and neglect in nursing homes and other residential 
      care facilities, is coordinated by a Civil Division attorney, and focuses 
      on eight key areas: (1) stepped up enforcement; (2) improved coordination 
      among federal agencies and among federal, state and local law enforcement, 
      regulatory agencies and resident advocates; (3) development and use of data 
      systems to target facilities that provide inadequate care; (4) focused training, 
      particularly training that brings together prosecutors, investigators, regulators, 
      surveyors, advocates and others;(5) outreach efforts to industry to promote 
      compliance and to patient advocates, medical professionals and academics; 
      (6) new legislation to address gaps in federal law; (7) improved services 
      to victims of fraud, abuse and neglect; and (8) analysis of state laws to 
      identify effective or promising state abuse and neglect statutes and enforcement 
      practices. This Initiative complements the efforts being undertaken at HCFA 
      and HHS/OIG, communication and coordination are facilitated by monthly Steering 
      Committee meetings attended by the Criminal Division, FBI, HHS/OIG, and 
      HCFA. 
    <P>The financial crisis in the nursing home industry has to date resulted 
      in bankruptcy filings by two of the ten largest nursing home chains and 
      several smaller chains. These bankruptcy cases, the largest ever involving 
      health care providers, raise both financial and quality of care issues, 
      and require significant on-going coordination between the Civil Division's 
      Corporate Finance (bankruptcy experts) and Civil Fraud sections, the Criminal 
      Division, HCFA, and HHS/OIG. 
    <P>The Civil Division continues to chair the Managed Care Fraud Working Group, 
      which meets quarterly and coordinates the managed care enforcement activities 
      of DOJ, FBI, HHS/OIG, HCFA, TRICARE Management activity of the Department 
      of Defense, Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General, 
      The National Association of Attorneys General, the National Association 
      of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments</STRONG> 
    <P>In 1999, 182 new health care fraud matters were initiated. In addition 
      to pursuing more health care fraud allegations, the Civil Division is pursuing 
      an increasing number of health care fraud cases in which the apparent single 
      damages are particularly high. Following is a discussion of some of the 
      significant cases the Division has been involved in during 1999. 
    <P>A $32 million payment was received from a university -- the largest recovery 
      ever in a case involving either the Food and Drug Administration or the 
      National Institutes of Health (NIH). The case established favorable new 
      case law and its settlement resolved allegations that, for more than two 
      decades, the University had illegally profited from selling an unlicensed 
      drug, failed to report the sales income to NIH, improperly tested the drug 
      on patients and improperly used grant funds. 
    <P>The Civil Division, in conjunction with 39 USAOs, is handling<EM> </EM>a 
      <EM>qui tam</EM> action alleging that 100 hospitals located nationwide upcoded 
      pneumonia diagnosis codes to falsely obtain higher Medicare reimbursements. 
      Thus far, settlements have been reached with eight defendants for a total 
      recovery of $15.4 million. 
    <P>A $15 million settlement resolved a case against a billing service and 
      its physician founder, for submitting false claims on behalf of emergency 
      physicians around the country. The settlement with the United States and 
      twenty-eight states was reached after a trial on liability in which the 
      court found both the company and the owner liable for violating the False 
      Claims Act. In addition to the civil settlement, the owner was excluded 
      from participation in all federal health care programs for fifteen years. 
    <P>A drugstore chain paid nearly $8 million to settle allegations of submitting 
      false prescription claims to state Medicaid and other federally-funded health 
      programs. The case was the first to address a common practice of billing 
      insurance programs for the full amount of prescriptions which were only 
      partially filled. 
    <P>Vital resources were made available from the Account to provide the Civil 
      Division with Automated Litigation Support (ALS), auditors and consultants. 
      These resources supplemented other Civil Division funds. During 1999, ALS 
      was provided to 14 cases while auditor/consultant support was provided to 
      21 cases. Four of the supported cases have settled, yielding more than $44 
      million. Recoveries in the remaining cases are expected to reach hundreds 
      of millions of dollars.

      to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to carry out the purposes described

    <P>Successful health care fraud enforcement cannot be achieved by any one 
      agency alone. Investigations must be a cooperative effort if they are to 
      be successful in combating the increasing problems of health care fraud. 
      The FBI is involved in this cooperative effort. The FBI works many health 
      care fraud cases on a joint basis with other federal agencies, including 
      the HHS/OIG. These two federal agencies collaborate through attendance at 
      health care fraud working groups, attend each other's training conferences, 
      and have a liaison program between the two organizations. In addition, the 
      Health Care Fraud task forces represent the coordinated efforts of the FBI, 
      state and local law enforcement, investigative agencies such as Inspectors 
      General, and private industry. The FBI and HHS/OIG share a common commitment 
      to ending fragmented health care fraud enforcement. 
    <P>In addition to providing new statutory tools to combat health care fraud, 
      HIPAA specified mandatory funding to the FBI for health care fraud enforcement. 
      In 1999, $66 million was provided by HIPAA for 651 positions (380 agents). 
      The FBI used this funding, in large part, to fund an additional 40 agents 
      and 42 support positions for health care fraud and to create several new 
      dedicated Health Care Fraud Squads. This increase in personnel resources 
      along with the direct FBI funding increased the number of FBI agents addressing 
      health care fraud in the fourth quarter of 1999 to approximately 493 agents 
      as compared to 112 in 1992. 
    <P>As the FBI has increased the number of agents assigned to health care fraud 
      investigations, the caseload has increased dramatically from 591 cases in 
      1992, to 3,027 cases through 1999. The FBI caseload is divided between those 
      health plans receiving government funds and those that are privately funded. 
      Criminal health care fraud convictions resulting from FBI investigations 
      have risen from 116 in 1992, to 548 in 1999. 
    <P>Health care fraud investigations are among those investigations having 
      the highest priority within the FBI. The investigations are generally complex 
      and require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully investigate. 
      Often sophisticated, innovative and creative ideas are needed to combat 
      and eventually prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes. As the complexity 
      and long-term nature of health care fraud investigations increase, the FBI 
      anticipates that the number of FBI investigations and convictions will begin 
      to level off. 
    <P>As part of the FBI's national strategy to address health care fraud, the 
      Bureau utilizes proactive investigative techniques, to include the use of 
      undercover operations. A major FBI led undercover investigation culminated 
      in 1999 with the last of over 40 subjects either entering guilty pleas or 
      being found guilty at trial as a result of their participation in a fraud 
      scheme that robbed the Medicare Program of millions of dollars. During this 
      investigation the FBI actually purchased a bogus home health agency and 
      through various business dealings with the subjects uncovered a system rampant 
      with fraud from top to bottom. 
    <P>A considerable portion of the increased funding was utilized to support 
      major health care fraud investigations. In addition, operational support 
      has been provided for FBI national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical 
      diversion, chiropractic fraud, and medical clinics. Further, the Health 
      Care Fraud Unit, FBI Headquarters, supported individual field offices with 
      equipment and supplies to assist in numerous individual investigations. 
    <P>The funding made available through HIPAA also made possible two Basic Health 
      Care Fraud training conferences which provided the expertise necessary for 
      an additional 200 FBI agents to address the health care fraud crime problem. 
      A total of 82 additional FBI agents received specialized training on fraud 
      schemes plaguing a particular provider service that has been historically 
      vulnerable to fraud. The HIPAA funding also allowed FBI headquarters staff 
      to conduct specialized training sessions in a number of FBI field offices 
      and to make numerous presentations to various industry groups. <A name=q>&nbsp;</A>
