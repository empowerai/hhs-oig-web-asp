<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established 
a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC or the Program), 
under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS)<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, acting through 
the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed to coordinate federal, 
state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and 
abuse. In its seventh year of operation, the Program's continued success again 
confirmed the soundness of a collaborative approach to identify and prosecute 
the most egregious instances of health care fraud, to prevent future fraud or 
abuse, and to protect program beneficiaries.</p><p><b>Monetary Results</b></p><p> 
In 2003, the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.8 billion in judgments 
and settlements in health care fraud matters. As a result of enforcement actions, 
judgments, settlements, and administrative proceedings, the Federal government 
collected more than $1.4 billion and distributed more than $1.03 billion during 
FY 2003. Over $500 million that was collected during the FY 2003 reporting period 
was distributed in early 2004 and the distribution of these funds will be described 
in greater detail in the Annual Report for 2004<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. 
Of the amount distributed to victim agencies in FY 2003, approximately $723 million 
was returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and $151.6 million was returned to the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") as the Federal share of Medicaid 
restitution. The HCFAC account has returned over $5.69 billion to the Medicare 
Trust Fund since the inception of the program in 1997.</p><p><b>Enforcement Actions</b></p><p>Federal 
prosecutors filed 362 criminal indictments in health care fraud cases in 2003. 
A total of 437 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes 
during the year. There were also 1,277 civil matters pending, and 231 civil cases 
filed in 2003. HHS excluded 3,275 individuals and entities from participating 
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federally sponsored health care 
programs, most as a result of convictions for crimes relating to Medicare or Medicaid, 
for patient abuse or neglect, or as a result of licensure revocations. </p><p> 
<hr width="70%"> <h1 align="center"><a name="2"></a>INTRODUCTION</h1><hr width="70%"> 
<p align="center"><b> ANNUAL REPORT OF<br> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SECRETARY<br> 
DETAILING EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES<br> UNDER THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE 
CONTROL PROGRAM<br> FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003<br> </b></p><p><b> <center> As Required 
by<br> Section 1817(k)(5) of the Social Security Act </center></b></p><p> <center> 
<h2><b><u>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</u></b> </h2></center><p></p><p>The Social Security 
Act section 1128C(a), as established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA or the Act), created the Health Care Fraud and 
Abuse Control Program, a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse in health 
care, including both public and private health plans.</p><p>The Act requires that 
an amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations -- including criminal 
fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, and administrative penalties, 
but excluding restitution, compensation to the victim agency, and relators' shares 
-- be deposited in the Medicare Trust Fund. All funds deposited in the Trust Fund 
as a result of the Act are available for the operations of the Trust Fund<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p><p>The 
Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund to an expenditure account, 
called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (the Account), in amounts 
that the Secretary and Attorney General jointly certify as necessary to finance 
anti-fraud activities. The maximum amounts available for certification are specified 
in the Act. Certain of these sums are to be used only for activities of HHS/OIG, 
with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2003, the Secretary and the 
Attorney General certified $240.558 million for appropriation to the Account. 
A detailed breakdown of the allocation of these funds is set forth later in this 
report. These resources generally supplement the direct appropriations of HHS 
and the Department of Justice (DOJ) that are devoted to health care fraud enforcement, 
though they provide the sole source of funding for Medicare and Medicaid enforcement 
by HHS/OIG. (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received $114 
million from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.)</p><p>Under the joint 
direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the Program's goals are:</p><ol> 
<li>to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating to 
health care fraud and abuse;<br> <br> </li><li> to conduct investigations, audits 
and evaluations relating to the delivery of and payment for health care in the 
United States;<br> <br> </li><li> to facilitate enforcement of all applicable 
remedies for such fraud;<br> <br> </li><li> to provide guidance to the health 
care industry regarding fraudulent practices; and<br> <br> </li><li> to establish 
a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions against health 
care providers.</li></ol><p>The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary 
to submit a joint annual report to the Congress which identifies both:</p><ol> 
<li> the amounts appropriated to the Trust Fund for the previous fiscal year under 
various categories and the source of such amounts; and<br> <br> </li><li>the amounts 
appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use by the Attorney General 
and the Secretary and the justification for the expenditure of such amounts.</li></ol><p>This 
annual report fulfills the above statutory requirements. </p><p> <hr width="70%"> 
<h1 align="center"><a name="3"></a>MONETARY RESULTS</h1><hr width="70%"> <p>As 
required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the amounts 
deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source of such 
deposits. In 2003, over $1.03 billion was deposited with the Department of the 
Treasury and CMS, transferred to other federal agencies administering health care 
programs, or paid to private persons during the fiscal year. In addition, over 
$500 million collected in 2003 was distributed in the first quarter of fiscal 
year 2004 and will be described in greater detail in the Annual Report for 2004<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

</table><h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2><p><b><u>Overall Recoveries</u></b></p><p>In 2003, 
the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.8 billion in judgments and 
settlements in health care fraud matters. As a result of enforcement actions, 
judgments, settlements, and administrative proceedings, the Federal government 
was able to distribute during 2003 $1.03 billion of the funds collected. Approximately 
$723 million of this amount was returned to the Medicare Trust Fund, and $151.6 
million was recovered as the Federal share of Medicaid restitution. Some of the 
judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in 2003 will result in 
distributions in future years, just as some of the distributions in 2003 are attributable 
to actions from prior years. As noted previously, over $500 million collected 
in fiscal year 2003 was distributed early in fiscal year 2004.</p><p>This fiscal 
year, HHS and DOJ have brought to successful conclusion the investigation and 
prosecution of numerous health care fraud schemes. These achievements confirm 
once again the importance of coordination between HHS and DOJ to maximize recoveries 
for taxpayer-funded health care programs victimized by fraud and/or abuse, and 
to promote prompt detection, punishment and deterrence of those who exploit health 
care programs for personal or corporate gain. In addition to the enforcement actions 
described in this report, numerous audits, evaluations and other coordinated efforts 
have yielded substantial recoveries of overpaid funds, protected vulnerable beneficiaries, 
and prompted changes in Federal health care programs that reduce susceptibility 
to fraud. During FY 2003, the many significant accomplishments of the HCFAC Program 
included the following:</p><p><b><u>Pharmaceutical Companies</u></b></p><ul> <li><b>AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals and Zeneca, Inc. (AstraZeneca)</b>, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, 
pled guilty and agreed to pay $355 million to resolve criminal and civil fraud 
allegations arising from its marketing of Zoladex, a drug used to treat prostate 
cancer. As a result of an investigation conducted by the United States Attorney 
for the District of Delaware, working with the HHS/OIG, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the FBI, AstraZeneca pled 
guilty to violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act by causing false claims 
to be filed for Zoladex that was furnished to urologists as free samples. In addition, 
the company agreed to pay more than $265 million to settle allegations that it 
caused false claims to be filed with Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Railroad 
Retirement Board, and another $24.9 million for failing to pay proper rebates 
owed to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. AstraZeneca also entered 
into a rigorous 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the HHS/OIG, under 
which the company agreed to affirmatively report certain drug prices to Medicare 
and Medicaid, and to take other steps to promote proper billing practices. <br><br> 
<li><b>Bayer Corporation</b> paid more than $257 million in global settlement 
of the FCA and criminal allegations that it attempted to evade paying required 
rebates to state Medicaid programs for sales of two drugs, Cipro (an antibiotic) 
and Adalat (an anti-hypertensive). In what is known as a "lick and stick scheme," 
Bayer allegedly sold re-labeled drugs to a large HMO at significant discount, 
then concealed the discounts and so avoided having to pay millions of dollars 
in rebates to Medicaid. Bayer also pled guilty to charges filed by the United 
States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts that it violated the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by failing to notify FDA that it was producing private 
label Cipro. The company also agreed to extend an ongoing CIA with the HHS/OIG, 
and strengthen its terms to ensure that Bayer will accurately report its best 
price information to the government. <br><br> <li><b>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</b>, 
In a similar case, GSK settled its civil liability under the FCA for repackaging 
Paxil (an anti-depressant) and Flonase (a nasal spray) for sale at deep discounts 
to the same large HMO. Again, the company concealed these discounts, and so underpaid 
rebates due to the Medicaid program. GSK agreed to pay more than $87 million, 
and to comply with the terms of a CIA designed to ensure that GSK will accurately 
reports its "best price" information to the government in the future. <br><br> 
The monies recovered in the AstraZeneca, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline settlements 
were shared among the Federal Government, 49 states, the District of Columbia, 
and the Public Health Service.<br> <br> <li><b>Pfizer Corporation and Subsidiaries, 
Warner-Lambert and Parke-Davis (Pfizer)</b>, agreed to pay $49 million to resolve 
alleged false claims arising from sale of the cholesterol-lowering drug, Lipitor. 
The company allegedly failed to report accurately to CMS its "best price" as required 
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. By overstating its price, the company 
allegedly retained more than $20 million in rebates owed to the Medicaid program. 
Pfizer also entered into a five-year CIA under which Pfizer must certify its process 
for determining best price, and adopt internal safeguards to prevent improper 
reporting in the future. </ul><p><b><u>Prescription Drug Fraud</u></b></p><ul> 
<li> A South Florida defendant was sentenced after conviction at trial to 10½ 
years' incarceration for her role as the mastermind behind a conspiracy that fraudulently 
billed Medicare for over $20 million worth of prescription drugs. The conspiracy 
centered around four Miami pharmacies that illegally manufactured prescription 
aerosol drugs. The pharmacies sold the illegally manufactured drugs although in 
some cases, only labels or half-portions were actually delivered to DME companies 
that billed Medicare directly under Medicare rules that allow for payment for 
drugs taken by way of medical equipment. The fraudulently manufactured drugs were 
intended for bogus patients who had been paid for use of their Medicare numbers; 
approximately 1400 patients in the Miami area were involved in the scam. To enable 
the fraud, physicians were paid to sign blank prescriptions, and, in almost every 
case, the physicians never examined the patients or even looked at fraudulent 
charts that were concocted to fool Medicare inspectors. Five other individuals 
were also convicted at trial and sentenced to terms of incarceration for their 
participation in the conspiracy; eighteen other defendants entered pleas of guilty 
and were sentenced in connection with the scheme. <br><br> <li> A South Florida 
urologist pleaded guilty to 59 counts of health care fraud and unlawful distribution 
of prescription drugs. Between July 2000 and November 2001, he prescribed Lupron, 
a drug used for the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer, to a number 
of patients, and undertook to administer it to the patients in the form of injections. 
However, the defendant did not administer the prescribed and requisite dosages 
of Lupron to at least 32 patients who came to him for treatment. The physician 
billed the patients and their health insurance carriers for the cancer treatments, 
regardless of whether the drug was actually administered. In addition, he unlawfully 
distributed Lupron wholesale through a series of sales totaling more than $1.5 
million. In pleading guilty, he was sentenced to 51 months of incarceration and 
3 years of supervised release in addition to also surrendering his medical license. 
</ul><p><b><u>Internet Pharmacy Fraud</u></b></p><ul> <li>In October 2003, a Texas 
pharmacist was convicted of a drug king-pin count and for money laundering for 
his role in conspiring to illegally dispense hydrocodone in an Internet pharmacy 
operation he ran. The pharmacist, who owned Friendly Pharmacy located in Texas 
and MainStreet Pharmacy located in Oklahoma, employed three doctors and paid them 
$40-100 per signed prescription. Customers of the internet websites would fill 
out a simple questionnaire, request their drug of choice (in most cases, hydrocodone 
- a Schedule III controlled substance) and then pay both a "doctor consultation 
fee" and the fee for the prescription drugs. The doctors reported they never declined 
a prescription, and never examined the patients. One doctor admitted at trial 
that he never reviewed the questionnaires filled out by the customers and another 
doctor fell asleep while signing the prescriptions. Neither of the online pharmacies 
had any way of verifying the age of the recipient. Unlike when the patient sees 
the doctor, a minor can easily log onto a website and fill out an inaccurate age. 
Tragically, a La Mesa, California high school honors student and athlete died 
at home from an overdose of Vicodin ordered from one of the pharmacies. <br><br>	
The pharmacist faces a mandatory 20 year to life sentence. All of the other participants 
were either found guilty by a jury or pled guilty. The government also obtained 
a $5.6 million asset forfeiture judgment against the pharmacist. <br><br> <li>A 
South Florida husband and wife were sentenced to terms of 37 months and 24 months 
imprisonment, respectively, after being convicted by a jury of unlawfully distributing 
prescription drugs through the Internet. The defendants sold powerful prescription 
pain killers through web sites operated from their home without requiring a physician's 
review or a prescription and placed no restrictions on the quantities or frequency 
with which customers could purchase drugs. In an effort to evade detection by 
law enforcement, the defendants cut out the manufacturer's lot numbers placed 
on each of the drug containers they sold, thereby making the drugs untraceable; 
concealed their identities through using false names; used 32 variations of false 
return addresses on packages; and advertised that they were an overseas company. 
In little over a year, the defendants earned in excess of $1.2 million in gross 
revenues, all of which went to an off-shore bank account in the Cayman Islands. 
</ul><p><b><u>Hospitals</u></b></p><ul> <li><b>HCA Inc.</b> (formerly known as 
Columbia/HCA and HCA-The Healthcare Company), entered a settlement agreement with 
the Federal government, marking the end of the most comprehensive multi-agency 
health care fraud investigation of a provider ever undertaken by federal enforcement 
authorities. Under the agreement, HCA paid $631 million plus interest to resolve 
civil liability for alleged false claims arising from a variety of practices, 
including false cost reports to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE, and kickbacks. 
When added to earlier criminal pleas and a 2001 FCA settlement, and a separate 
settlement with the CMS, the government recovered a total of $ 1.7 billion from 
HCA. The settlement agreement also incorporates the terms of a Corporate Integrity 
Agreement with the HHS/OIG, under which HCA will maintain comprehensive compliance 
measures into the year 2009. <br><br> <li><b>Lovelace Health Systems, Inc.</b> 
(Lovelace) agreed to pay the government $24.5 million and implement certain integrity 
requirements to resolve its liability under the FCA. The Cigna-owned hospital 
and health maintenance organization allegedly falsified its Medicare cost reports 
for the ten years ending in 1998. Among the allegations, Lovelace improperly shifted 
costs of its health maintenance organization (HMO) patients to Medicare and otherwise 
inflated Medicare reimbursement. The investigation stemmed from a <em>qui tam</em> 
filed by an employee of a financial consultant that prepared cost reports for 
Lovelace. <br><br> <li><b>St. Luke's Subacute Hospital and Nursing Center, Inc.</b> 
and its president and CEO were convicted of six counts of Medicare fraud. The 
officer directed his employees to manipulate the company's books to inflate the 
amount of reimbursable nursing time spent on Medicare patients. In 1997, 1998 
and 1999, he submitted reimbursement claims to Medicare for nursing costs that 
overstated St. Luke's Hospital's entitlement by nearly $3 million. He then directed 
an employee to create false nursing schedules in an attempt to hide inflated nursing 
costs from Medicare auditors, a fraud that was uncovered when law enforcement 
compared the false nursing schedules to true nursing schedules that were seized 
during a 1996 search warrant. <br><br> <li><b>Rapid City Regional Hospital</b> 
paid $6 million to settle civil allegations arising from unlawful patient referrals 
from oncologists with whom the hospital had financial relationships. The parties 
allegedly violated the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, better known as the "Stark" 
law, which is designed to ensure that patients receive the benefit of unbiased 
medical judgment from their physicians. The statute prohibits doctors from referring 
patients to clinical laboratories, diagnostic centers, and other facilities in 
which they hold financial interests, and prohibits hospitals from paying for referrals 
from physicians with whom they have financial relationships. The FCA case involved 
allegations that the hospital had supplied Oncology Associates with office space, 
staff services, and other benefits to induce the oncologists to refer their cancer 
patients to the hospital. The physician practice, Oncology Associates, also paid 
the United States an additional $525,000 for overbilling Medicare for their patients' 
office visits. <br><br> <li><b>Public Health Trust of Miami-Dade County, d.b.a. 
Jackson Memorial Hospital</b> paid the United States $16.8 million to settle civil 
allegations that it had submitted duplicate claims for the same services as both 
outpatient clinic and inpatient services. <br><br> <li><b>McLeod Regional Medical 
Center of Pee Dee, Inc.</b> paid the United States $15.9 million to settle civil 
allegations that it submitted false claims to the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE 
programs for hospital and home health services ordered by physicians with whom 
McLeod, and its for-profit subsidiary, McLeod Physician Services, had unlawful 
compensation arrangements. The FCA suit alleged that McLeod's financial relationships 
with the physicians violated the Stark law and the Anti-Kickback Statute because 
the hospital had agreed to pay the physicians more than fair market value for 
their practices, then paid them salaries exceeding fair market value, to induce 
and maintain referral relationships with the physicians. The Government also alleged 
that McLeod included false claims for Medicare reimbursement of unallowable costs 
on the hospital's cost reports as a means to offset losses incurred in acquiring 
the practices. <br><br> <li>Five hospital subsidiaries of <b>Tenet Healthcare 
Corporation</b> agreed to pay over $4.15 million to settle civil allegations that 
they "upcoded" Medicare patients' pneumonia and septicemia diagnoses. Hospitals 
receive Medicare reimbursement by assigning codes that reflect a patient's diagnosis 
at the time of discharge. Upcoding is the practice of assigning a code that reflects 
a falsely high level of patient acuity and medical service in order to generate 
higher reimbursement than the provider otherwise would receive. The five Florida 
hospitals involved were Coral Gables Hospital, Coral Gables; Florida Medical Center, 
Fort Lauderdale; Hialeah Hospital, Hialeah; Hollywood Medical Center, Hollywood; 
and Parkway Regional Medical Center, Miami. <br><br> <li><b>Columbia University</b> 
paid $5.1 million to settle civil charges that, for more than a decade, the university 
improperly billed the Medicaid program for deliveries and other obstetrical procedures 
conducted at New York-Presbyterian Hospital's Allen Pavilion. The Government alleged 
that the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at the hospital routinely had physicians 
whose services would be reimbursed by Medicaid claim they themselves had treated 
patients when, in fact, the patients were seen by health care providers ineligible 
for reimbursement, such as midwives. </ul><p><b><u>Durable Medical Equipment</u></b></p><ul> 
<li>20 defendants pleaded guilty in Arizona to engaging in a fraud scheme in which 
they falsely billed Medicare for more than $25 million in DME. The defendants 
created approximately 30 sham DME entities in the western United States. For 3½ 
years, they used unlawfully obtained Medicare information to falsely bill Medicare 
for DME either not provided or not ordered by a physician, including expensive 
motorized wheelchairs, hospital beds with special mattresses, and products used 
for delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract. <br><br> <li>A 
South Florida DME supplier was sentenced to 84 months in prison and ordered to 
pay nearly $14.5 million in restitution for two schemes to defraud the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs. The court also entered a more than $14.8 million forfeiture 
order. The defendant and others fraudulently billed Medicare and Medicaid for 
items such as motorized wheelchairs and alternating pressure mattresses. To date, 
12 corporations and 14 individual defendants have pleaded guilty in connection 
with the schemes, and one person was convicted after a jury trial. The supplier 
also entered into a civil settlement agreement with the United States on behalf 
of himself and 15 business entities, resulting in a consent judgment being entered 
against him and the entities for more than $29 million. <br><br> <li>The Texas 
owner and operator of two DME companies was convicted at trial, sentenced to 120 
months incarceration, and ordered to pay $384,984 in restitution for defrauding 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The defendant billed Medicare and Medicaid 
for items that were never supplied to patients, including alternating pressure 
mattresses, hydraulic patient lifts, and lymphedema pumps. In other instances 
in which items were supplied, she submitted billings with false patient diagnoses 
for patients who had not been evaluated by a physician and did not qualify for 
the product. The defendant's husband pled guilty in connection with the same scheme 
and was sentenced to 12 months and one day of incarceration. <br><br> <li>A physician 
convicted for obstruction of justice and mail fraud was sentenced to nearly 3 
years imprisonment, and ordered to pay a $7,500 fine and be deported upon his 
release. A fugitive since 1988, the physician performed cursory physical exams 
for a DME company which used these exams to justify prescriptions for transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units to Medicare beneficiaries. However, 
the physician never actually performed the thorough examination required, nor 
did he advise the beneficiaries on the use and risks of the TENS units. The physician 
also signed blank certificates of medical necessity so that the TENS units could 
be billed to Medicare. His codefendants were previously sentenced for their roles 
in the scheme. </ul><p><b><u>Physicians</u></b></p><ul> <li>A Coral Gables, Florida, 
eye surgeon was convicted of 90 counts of Medicare fraud and ordered to pay $812,216 
in restitution and $50,000 in fines for billing the Medicare program for services 
he did not provide. The surgeon fabricated medical charts and billing records, 
and submitted claims to Medicare, for various diagnostic tests he never conducted 
and laser eye surgeries that he never rendered. In many instances, elderly Medicare 
patients were led to believe that they had serious eye diseases that could result 
in blindness if not treated when in fact they did not have such illnesses. At 
one of the clinics, the defendant regularly claimed to have performed ophthalmic 
services when the equipment necessary to perform the procedures was not even present 
at the medical clinic on the claimed dates of service. <br><br> <li>Six Southern 
California physicians pleaded guilty to health care fraud for engaging in a scheme 
to defraud United States insurance companies. The defendants, who were Mexican 
nationals who practiced in Mexico, filed claims with United States insurance companies 
for medical treatment, services, and supplies supposedly provided to United States 
citizens in Mexico; in reality, the treatment, services, and supplies were not 
provided as claimed. The defendants were arrested as part of an FBI undercover 
operation dubbed "Operation Golden Tooth" in which the undercover agent - posing 
as a participant in the scam - persuaded the doctors to travel to the United States, 
where they were arrested upon arrival. </ul><p><b><u>Home Health</u></b></p><ul> 
<li><b>Caremark, Rx, Inc.</b> (formerly MedPartners, Inc.) paid the United States 
$7.5 million to settle civil allegations that false home health care claims had 
been submitted by a former MedPartners' subsidiary, AmCare, Inc., a Florida home 
health agency. </ul><p><b><u>Home Health</u></b></p><ul> <li><b>Dialysis Holdings</b>, 
Inc. paid $4,102,098 to settle an FCA action alleging that the company knowingly 
submitted requests to Medicare for medically unnecessary laboratory tests and 
blood draws. Dialysis Holdings, Inc. and its predecessor corporations provided 
dialysis services to thousands of terminally ill Massachusetts patients afflicted 
with end stage renal disease (ESRD), whose laboratory costs are covered by Medicare. 
Dialysis conspired with a clinical laboratory to perform unnecessary blood draws 
on ESRD patients, create thousands of referrals for laboratory tests that were 
not needed, split automated chemistry panels of tests so as to avoid a Medicare 
rule designed to control lab test costs, and deceive physicians and laboratory 
employees into unknowing participation in the scheme. <br><br> <li><b>Dianon Systems, 
Inc.</b> paid $4.8 million to resolve allegations of Medicare and TRICARE billing 
fraud under the FCA. Dianon, which conducts tests to detect various types of cancer, 
had billed for medically unnecessary DNA tests and second-opinion consultations 
and reports it failed to provide. <br><br> <li><b>Mediq, Inc.</b> and its subsidiaries 
(collectively, Mediq), agreed to pay $1 million to resolve their civil liability 
under the FCA. The case stemmed from allegations that Mediq billed Medicare for 
transtelephonic electrocardiograms (ECGs) when no such tests were performed. Instead, 
Medic performed standard ECGs, a service that is reimbursed at a significantly 
lower rate. </ul><p><b><u>Ambulance Services</u></b></p><ul> <li>A New York ambulance 
company operator was sentenced to 78 months in prison, was ordered to pay restitution 
of more than $57 million, and was subject to an $8 million forfeiture order for 
health care fraud arising from his fraudulent operation of several ambulance and 
ambulette services. In March 1990, the HHS/OIG excluded the individual from participation 
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for a period of 25 years. In order to evade 
this program exclusion, he established secret ownership of five ambulance and 
ambulette companies in Brooklyn, New York, and continued to bill Medicare and 
Medicaid for patient transportation. He also offered and paid bribes and kickbacks 
to employees of various hospitals to induce them to order ambulance and ambulette 
services from his companies. </ul><p><b><u>Physical Therapists</u></b></p><ul> 
<li>Two former operators of Texas medical clinics pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
to commit health care fraud, and paying kickbacks for the referral of Medicare 
and Medicaid patients in connection with several schemes that resulted in more 
than $11 million of false billings to Medicare and Medicaid. The defendants and 
others operated six physical therapy clinics in the Houston area, and billed Medicare 
and Medicaid for claims for physical therapy services never performed, claims 
using a false diagnosis, and claims for services not ordered by a licensed physician 
or not performed under the supervision of a licensed physician. As part of the 
scheme, the defendants hired patient recruiters, known as "marketers," who were 
paid a kickback for each patient referred to the clinics for physical therapy; 
clinic employees were also paid kickbacks for referrals. Four co-defendants also 
pleaded guilty to health care fraud in connection with this matter; three other 
defendants, including two doctors, have proceeded to trial. </ul><p><b><u>Medicare 
Contractors</u></b></p><ul> <li><b>Blue Cross of California (Blue Cross)</b>, 
a former Medicare fiscal intermediary, and its parent company, <b>Wellpoint Health 
Networks, Inc.</b>, agreed to pay $9.3 million to resolve their potential civil 
and administrative liability for false claims. For ten years ending in 2000, Blue 
Cross allegedly falsified data regarding its performance of health care provider 
audits while under contract with CMS. The intermediary primarily falsified audit 
start and completion dates entered into an audit tracking database. The government 
alleged that these erroneous entries were intended to mislead CMS regarding its 
performance of required audit work so as to obtain a favorable annual evaluation, 
and to ensure renewal of its Medicare contract. <br><br> <li>In Missouri, a director 
and manager for a former Medicare contractor were sentenced for conspiring to 
falsify and conceal information about errors made by the contractor. The director 
was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined $6,000; the manager was sentenced 
to 3 months in prison. These former executives ordered the falsification of records, 
beneficiary files, claims and other official documents, which, when reviewed by 
CMS, gave the contractor the appearance of performing at a higher level of efficiency 
and quality than was actually the case. This appearance of exemplary performance 
enabled the contractor to secure and maintain its contract with the government 
by being ranked for many years as one of the top 10 in the country. In June 2002, 
the contractor agreed to pay the government $76 million for its alleged misconduct. 
</ul><p><b><u>Quality of Care</u></b></p>One area in which collaboration among 
the federal authorities responsible for health oversight has proved most effective 
has been in enforcement and oversight of issues relating to quality of care, as 
demonstrated by the following: <br><br> <b>Prosecution:</b> <ul> <li><b>Endo Vascular 
Technologies, Inc. (EVT)</b>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the medical device 
manufacturer Guidant Corporation, pled guilty to 10 felonies and agreed to pay 
$92.4 million as part of a global resolution of charges that it covered up malfunction 
of its device used to treat aortic aneurysms. These incidents of malfunction included 
12 deaths and more than 50 emergency surgeries. Under Federal law, a company must 
submit a Medical Device Report to FDA every time its device may have caused serious 
injury or death. EVT filed 172 such reports, but in its guilty plea, admitted 
to failing to file reports in 2,600 additional incidents. Moreover, the government 
contended that the company was aware of the incidents, since a company representative 
was required to be present in the operating room each time the device was inserted. 
<br><br> This global resolution is among the first felony convictions for failing 
to file Medical Device Reports with the FDA, and represents the largest dollar 
amount ever paid by a defendant for such failure. The investigation was conducted 
by the FDA and the FBI. In addition to the settlement agreement, Guidant and EVT 
agreed to enter into a comprehensive compliance agreement with the HHS/OIG. <br><br> 
<li><b>Redding Medical Center, Inc. (RMC)</b>, a hospital owned by Tenet Health 
Systems Hospitals, Inc., agreed to pay $54 million in settlement of liability 
for performing and billing Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE for unnecessary cardiac 
services for the time period 1997 through 2002. This represents the government's 
largest recovery ever in a case alleging lack of medical necessity for surgeries. 
RMC agreed to implement certain corporate compliance steps; nonetheless, possible 
exclusion from Federal health care programs was not waived in the settlement. 
<br><br> <li><b>The University of Chicago and Northwestern Memorial Hospitals</b>, 
agreed to settle charges in connection with their organ transplant programs. The 
hospitals agreed to pay $115,000 and $23,587 respectively, to resolve charges 
that the hospitals falsely diagnosed certain patients as more ill than they actually 
were. Based on these exaggerated diagnoses, the patients were allegedly moved 
ahead of others who were waiting for organs in that transplant region. The government 
also charged that the hospital billed Medicare or Medicaid for medically unnecessary 
services related to the overstated diagnoses. </ul><p><b>Exclusions:</b></p>One 
important mechanism for safeguarding the care provided to program beneficiaries 
is through exclusions of providers and suppliers who have engaged in patient abuse 
or neglect or fraud. During 2003, the HHS/OIG excluded more than 3,000 such individuals 
from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health care programs, 
among them: <ul> <li>A Missouri pharmacist was sentenced to 30 years in prison 
and ordered to pay more than $10 million in restitution and fines for diluting 
chemotherapy drugs he prepared for cancer patients. In 2003, both the pharmacist 
and his pharmacy were excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health 
care programs the pharmacist for 50 years and his pharmacy for 25 as a result 
of this conviction. Such lengthy exclusions were justified by the pharmacist's 
reckless disregard for the life-threatening consequences of his conduct. <br><br> 
<li>A Kansas physician was excluded for 25 years based on his conviction for longstanding 
fraud against Medicare and TRICARE. His scheme involved luring patients into unnecessary 
surgeries based on false representations. The physician was also convicted of 
perjury. The court sentenced him to 6 years in jail, and the state suspended and 
then summarily revoked his medical license. </ul><p><b><u>Nursing Home Studies:</u></b></p>Quality 
of nursing home care remains an area of intense interest for HHS/OIG. In recent 
years, the HHS/OIG conducted numerous studies assessing facets of the quality 
of life and care in nursing homes. In 2003, these studies included the following: 
<ul> <li>Quality Assurance Committees (QA Committees): QA Committees are internal 
organizations that provide a key point of accountability for ensuring quality 
of care. Nearly all nursing homes were found to meet CMS requirements for committee 
membership and frequency of meetings. QA Committees had access to information 
they needed to assess care, but were nonetheless hampered by staff shortages, 
turnover, and members who are inexperienced in committee work. <br><br> <li>Pyschosocial 
Services Oversight: Another inspection examined whether residents receive required 
psychosocial services, including a comprehensive initial assessment and periodic 
evaluations. Though most facilities employed a qualified social worker as required, 
more than one third of residents had incomplete care plans. Where plans existed, 
46 percent of residents did not receive all the psychosocial services outlined 
in those plans. The HHS/OIG recommended enhanced oversight of this aspect of the 
residential assessment and care plan. <br><br> <li>National Ombudsman Reporting 
System: Data was examined in the National Ombudsman Reporting System. It was found 
that the data corroborated deficiencies in resident care. Complaints to Ombudsmen 
are on the rise, with the highest frequency of nursing home complaints involving 
resident care. Accidents and requests for assistance were the most common. Others 
in the top dozen were: complaints of personal hygiene, medication administration 
and symptoms unattended, and categories that include complaints of unexplained 
bruises, medications not given, or failure to address a resident's changed condition. 
</ul>The prosecutions and settlements discussed above and throughout this report 
reflect the culmination of investigations that have been ongoing for several years. 
A more detailed description of other accomplishments of the major Federal participants 
in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA follows. While information in 
this report is presented in the context of a single agency, most of the accomplishments 
described herein reflect the combined efforts of HHS, DOJ and other partners in 
the anti-fraud efforts. <p> <hr width="70%"> <p></p><h1 align="CENTER"><a name="41"></a>FUNDING 
FOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES</h1><hr width="70%"> <h2 align="CENTER"><b><a name="411"></a>Office 
of Inspector General</b></h2><p align="CENTER"> </p><p>Certain of the funds appropriated 
under HIPAA are, by law, set aside for Medicare and Medicaid activities of HHS/OIG. 
During the seventh year of the Program, the Act provided that between $150 and 
$160 million be devoted to these purposes. The Secretary and the Attorney General 
jointly allotted $160 million to HHS/OIG in 2003, an increase of $15 million over 
2002.</p><p>HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 819 prosecutions or settlements 
in 2003, of which 567, or 69 percent, were health care cases. A total of 3,275 
individuals and entities were also excluded, many as a result of criminal convictions 
for crimes related to Medicare or Medicaid (707); or to other health care programs 
(130); for patient abuse or neglect (257); or as a result of licensure revocations 
(1,747).</p><p>In addition to the role played by the HHS/OIG's in the judgments 
and settlements described in the Accomplishments section, HHS acted on HHS/OIG 
recommendations and collected $42.5 million in disallowances of improperly paid 
health care funds in 2003. HHS/OIG continues to work with CMS to develop and implement 
recommendations to correct systemic vulnerabilities detected during HHS/OIG evaluations 
and audits. These corrective actions often result in health care funds not expended 
(that is, funds put to better use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG initiatives). 
In 2003, such funds not expended amounted to more than $20.8 billion -- nearly 
$16.9 billion in Medicare savings, and $3.9 billion in savings to the Medicaid 
program.</p><p><b><u>Focus on Quality of Care</u></b></p><p>HHS/OIG investigations, 
audits and evaluations focus not just on improper billing for health care services, 
but also the quality of care provided to program beneficiaries. Activities designed 
to promote or safeguard beneficiary care included the following.</p><p><b>Program 
Exclusions:</b> The HHS/OIG excluded 3,275 individuals and entities from participation 
in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health care programs. Such exclusions 
are a vital way to prevent fraud and to protect program beneficiaries. Some of 
these exclusions are described in the Program Accomplishments section above. Others 
included the following:</p><ul> <li>A Missouri pathologist was indefinitely excluded 
after his Wisconsin license was revoked for prescribing drugs over the Internet 
without having performed physical examinations of the patients. This physician 
held 29 known professional health care licenses from other jurisdictions. Several 
of those licenses have also been sanctioned by the appropriate state authorities. 
<br><br> <li>An Alaska physician was excluded for 20 years after being convicted 
on 234 counts ranging from forgery and theft of public funds from the Alaska State 
Medicaid Program to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescription, and 
dispensing of a controlled substance. The Superior Court for the State of Alaska 
sentenced him to 7 years in prison and ordered him to pay approximately $240,000 
in restitution. His license to practice medicine as a physician and surgeon was 
revoked in Alaska and Wisconsin. <br><br> <li>A Colorado certified nurse aide 
(CNA) was excluded for 35 years based on his conviction for sexual abuse. The 
court sentenced the CNA to a term of 16 years to life in prison, and the state 
revoked his nurse aide certificate. </ul><p><b><u>Studies, Audits and Evaluations:</u></b></p><ul> 
<li><b>Prospective Payment System:</b> Medicare Part A serves an estimated 40 
million beneficiaries. In addition to acute care hospitals, which are reimbursed 
under a Prospective Payment System (PPS), Part A covers inpatient care in psychiatric, 
rehabilitation, critical access and long-term care hospitals. All such specialty 
hospitals are exempt from PPS. Medicare paid approximately $8.7 billion to PPS-exempt 
hospitals in 2000. HHS/OIG conducted a study to assess whether PPS-exempt hospital 
services were receiving the same oversight as acute care hospital services. The 
study found that routine statistical analyses and reviews for medical necessity 
and reasonableness were not being conducted of PPS-exempt inpatient services. 
Though fiscal intermediaries are free to review medical necessity of services 
provided in PPS-exempt settings, there is no funding dedicated to this undertaking. 
The study expressed concerns that without dedicated funding and explicit goals, 
oversight will likely remain uncertain. Moreover, to the extent that fiscal intermediaries 
do review PPS-exempt hospital services, the reviews will occur at the expense 
of oversight of other Part A providers, such as nursing homes and home health 
agencies. The OIG recommended that CMS ensure oversight of PPS-exempt hospital 
services, and CMS concurred. <br><br> <li><b>Study of Mental Health Drug Expenditures:</b> 
HHS/OIG evaluated whether Medicaid pays more in net costs for mental health drugs 
than do other Federal purchasers -- the 340B Program, Federal Supply Schedule, 
Federal Ceiling Price and military payers -- and if so, how much more. Examining 
reimbursements for 25 drugs in the ten states that are the largest payers for 
Medicaid prescription drugs, HHS/OIG found that price differences resulted in 
Medicaid's paying between 11 and 29 percent more than other Federal purchasers. 
This means Medicaid paid on average between $47 million and $126 million more 
for the same drugs. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS work with states to pursue 
more efficient means of purchasing pharmaceuticals and initiate a review of the 
Medicaid rebate program, and also suggested that CMS share this report with the 
states. <br><br> <li><b>Study of Payment Variations Between Outpatient Departments 
and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC):</b> The HHS/OIG measured the variation 
in Medicare reimbursement for services performed in ASCs, and the same services 
performed in hospital outpatient departments (OPDs). In most cases (66 percent), 
OPD rates for the same service were higher than those paid to ASCs. Because of 
these differences in reimbursement, Medicare paid an estimated $1.1 billion more 
in program payments in 2001. In addition, the HHS/OIG concluded that Medicare's 
list of procedures that may be performed in ASCs contained many that are commonly 
or safely performed in physicians' offices. Under CMS regulations, these procedure 
codes should be dropped from the list of ASC-covered procedures. Failing to do 
so resulted in an estimated $8 to $14 million in additional program payments in 
2001. The HHS/OIG recommended that rates between settings should be more uniform, 
a recommendation with which CMS concurred. The OIG also suggested that: 1) rates 
reflect only the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of health services, 
2) timely survey data be used to reevaluate ASC payment rates, and 3) procedure 
codes be removed from the list of ASC covered procedures using established criteria. 
<br><br> <li><b>Outlier Payments:</b> Under Medicare, payments over and above 
the usual Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) are available for services associated 
with extraordinarily costly inpatient hospital stays. These "outlier" payments 
encourage hospitals to treat seriously ill patients, even though the cost will 
greatly exceed normal payment rates. Medicare outlier payments totaled about $5 
billion in calendar year 2001. The HHS/OIG audited several hospitals within a 
hospital chain that aggressively increased its charges and, in so doing, significantly 
increased this chain's outlier payments from approximately $350 million in 2000, 
to more than $750 million two years later. Under Medicare's regulatory system, 
some hospitals increased charges (not necessarily related to increased costs) 
and may have caused inequities in the amount of outlier payments made to other 
hospitals and harmed uninsured patients. In December 2002, the HHS/OIG issued 
an "Early Alert" to CMS, alerting it of the preliminary findings and recommending 
that CMS take steps to prevent such a situation in the future. CMS's June 2003 
final rule addressed each of OIG's recommendations. In issuing that rule, CMS 
estimated that over the past 5 years, this practice caused the Medicare program 
to pay $9 billion beyond legislatively mandated target amounts set by CMS. <br><br> 
<li><b>Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments:</b> States' use of financing 
mechanisms designed to maximize Federal Medicaid reimbursement may sidestep Federal/State 
matching requirements and cast doubt on whether matching payments are being used 
to provide health care services for our vulnerable Medicaid populations. Medicaid 
authorizes states to make supplementary payments, called disproportionate share 
hospital (DSH) payments, to hospitals for the uncompensated costs of serving disproportionate 
numbers of low-income patients with special needs. Such payments may not exceed 
the individual hospitals' incurred uncompensated costs. The HHS/OIG continued 
its series of reviews in states across the country to assess both the propriety 
of DSH claims and to look more broadly at how states' use of DSH payments and 
intergovernmental transfers affect the Medicaid program as a whole. <br><br> During 
2003, reviews in 7 states generated a number of HHS/OIG findings and recommendations. 
Several states lacked controls sufficient to ensure DSH payments did not exceed 
the actual cost of providing services. In one case, DSH claims were calculated 
by a contractor, without sufficient state oversight and verification, resulting 
in over $50 million in duplicate claims. Another state made DSH payments that 
exceeded hospital limits by more than $500 million because it lacked controls 
to ensure payments did not exceed the cost of providing services. In addition, 
the state did not properly account for the Medicaid shortfall, failed to verify 
the accuracy of the hospitals' self-reported charges, and used a proxy method 
to calculate charges for hospitals that did not furnish supporting data. Another 
state incurred excess DSH payments of more than $252 million, in part, by not 
limiting total operating expenses to amounts allowable under Medicare. </ul><p><b><u>Fraud 
and Abuse Prevention</u></b></p>HIPAA's increased resources have enabled HHS/OIG 
to broaden its efforts both to detect fraud and abuse, and to prevent it. Prevention 
initiatives, such as those listed below, inform and assist the health care industry 
and its patients. Equally important, prevention activities reduce program losses 
and enforcement costs. <ul> <li><b>Industry Guidance:</b> The core of the HIPAA 
guidance initiatives is an advisory opinion process through which parties may 
obtain binding legal guidance as to whether their existing or proposed health 
care business transactions run afoul of the Federal anti-kickback statute, the 
civil monetary penalties laws, or the exclusion provisions. During 2003, HHS/OIG 
issued 15 opinions. A total of 101 advisory opinions have been issued since 1997. 
The advisory opinion process serves to enhance HHS/OIG's understanding of new 
and emerging health care business arrangements, and informs the development of 
new safe harbor regulations, fraud alerts, and special advisory bulletins. </ul><b>CIAs:</b> 
Many health care providers that enter agreements with the government to settle 
potential liabilities for violations of the FCA also agree to adhere to a separate 
CIA. Under this agreement, the provider commits to establishing a program or taking 
other specified steps to ensure its future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid 
rules. At the close of 2003, HHS/OIG was monitoring more than 375 CIAs. <br><br> 
<b>Recommendations for Systemic Improvements:</b> Frequently, investigations, 
audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or incentives for questionable or 
fraudulent financial practices in agency programs or administrative processes. 
As required by the Inspector General Act, HHS/OIG makes recommendations to address 
these vulnerabilities, and thereby promotes economy and efficiency in HHS programs 
and operations. Relying on the independent factual information generated by HHS/OIG, 
agency managers recommend legislative proposals or other corrective actions that, 
when enacted or implemented, close loopholes and reduce improper payments or conduct. 
The net savings from these joint efforts toward program improvements can be substantial. 
Many of the studies described throughout this report offered evidence and ideas 
supporting proposals for significant cost savings during 2003 and beyond. Examples 
of these reviews include the following: <ul> <li><b>School Based Health Services.</b> 
The HHS/OIG conducted a series of reviews focusing on Medicaid payments for school 
based health services. These multi-state audits assess whether Medicaid payments 
for school-based health services and associated administrative claims were proper. 
In 2002, reports were issued relating to 9 states; more are underway. There were 
a variety of audit findings and accompanying recommendations for corrective action. 
Among these findings were instances in which: Medicaid was billed for costs of 
special education in the fee-for-service rates paid exclusively for health services; 
services were contracted out at lower-than Medicaid rates and the savings were 
not passed along to Medicaid; costs were claimed without necessary documentation; 
payments were made to unqualified providers; duplicate claims were not returned 
to Medicaid; billings were made to Medicaid for services that were provided free 
to other students; there was failure to make required matching payments; claims 
were submitted for absent students; improper reimbursement was granted for unallowable 
transportation services; and services were provided to ineligible children. Of 
course, no single state experienced all of these difficulties. HHS/OIG made recommendations 
to recover funds where appropriate, and to enhance oversight to avoid erroneous 
or improper payments. <br><br> <li><b>Study of Donor Consent Rates.</b> An OIG 
inspection analyzed donor consent data for 190 of the nation's 255 transplant 
centers, comparing the number of patients who were medically eligible to be organ 
donors and the number of donors for whom consent was actually given. HHS/OIG found 
that the consent rate varied widely. Although the national average consent rate 
is 51 percent, the study found that of the190 transplant centers reviewed, 18 
had a consent rate below 30 percent. If these transplant centers had obtained 
consent at the average rate of the remaining 172 centers in the study, namely 
54 percent, the 18 centers would have realized 130 more donors  resulting in 
an estimated additional 450 life saving organs. <br><br> <li><b>DRG Payment Window.</b> 
Under the inpatient prospective payment system, hospitals are reimbursed a predetermined 
amount for inpatient services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries depending on 
the classification of their illnesses under a diagnosis-related group. Non-physician 
outpatient services (such as laboratory tests) rendered up to 3 days before the 
hospital admission must be included in the prospective payment. The intent of 
the payment "window" was to prevent separate reimbursement for preadmission services. 
OIG analyzed a statistical sample of Medicare payments for hospital inpatient 
stays and outpatient services that preceded that admission. OIG estimated that, 
for 10 diagnosis-related groups, Medicare reimbursed providers about $37 million 
for preadmission services rendered 4 to 14 days before admission. Beneficiaries 
paid an additional $35 million in coinsurance and deductibles for these services. 
OIG therefore recommended that CMS consider proposing legislation to expand the 
payment window to cover preadmission services rendered up to 14 days before admission. 
CMS agreed, but cautioned that such action could increase beneficiaries' health 
risks should providers schedule diagnostic tests outside the 14 day window. CMS 
will take such risks into account in proposing legislation to expand the payment 
window. <br><br> <li><b>Health Plan Cost Report.</b> The HHS/OIG audited a cost-based 
HMO under contract with CMS to provide health services on a prepayment basis to 
enrolled Medicare members. Under such a cost-based arrangement, CMS makes an interim 
payment each month to the Plan based on a per capita rate for each Medicare member. 
The interim payments are reconciled with the HMO's annual cost report. For contract 
years 1999 and 2000, the Plan claimed $6.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively, 
for additional Medicare costs over the amounts received as interim payments. The 
HHS/OIG found that the HMO overstated Medicare claims in years 1999 and 2000 by 
a total of approximately $8.2 million. In addition, the organization was not in 
compliance with the financial disclosure requirements for related- party administrative 
costs totaling about $14 million for both years. The audit recommended that the 
organization file amended Medicare cost reports, decreasing the amount claimed 
by $8.2 million, and take steps to properly report covered related-party transactions, 
and otherwise insure the integrity of its payment systems. The HMO generally concurred. 
</ul><p><b><u>Focus on DME</u></b></p><b>Audits and Evaluations:</b> <ul> <li><b>Semi-Electric 
Hospital Beds.</b> When a mattress and bedside rails are provided to a beneficiary 
at the same time as a semi-electric hospital bed, the suppliers are required to 
bill Medicare using an all-inclusive procedure code. Nationwide, Medicare reimbursement 
for this code during calendar year 2000 totaled $189 million. Following up on 
an earlier review, the HHS/OIG assessed whether fee schedule amounts for the code 
are excessive. To do so, HHS/OIG compared the fee schedule amount for this global 
code against the schedule amounts for the codes of the components (e.g., bed, 
mattress, side rails), and concluded that using the component coding could result 
in estimated annual savings of more than $34 million. Medicare beneficiaries, 
Medicaid programs, or supplemental insurers could also save nearly $9 million 
in coinsurance. In addition to discontinuing the problematic code, HHS/OIG recommended 
that CMS issue a final rule on the application of its inherent reasonableness 
authority so that it can be used to adjust the fee schedule amounts for this code. 
CMS agreed in part with the recommendations. <br><br> <li><b>Durable Medical Equipment 
Orders - Surrogate Unique Physician Identification Number (UPINs)</b>. Medicare 
beneficiaries are eligible to receive necessary medical equipment when ordered 
by a physician and certain non-physician practitioners (here, collectively referred 
to as "physicians"). Each physician is assigned a unique physician identification 
number (UPIN) by Medicare. UPINs help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries utilize 
DME only when authorized by a qualified physician, and allow CMS to aggregate 
data by UPIN and identify aberrant ordering practices. DME suppliers must include 
the UPIN of the ordering physician on DME claims to Medicare. However, if the 
physician has not yet been assigned a UPIN, Medicare permits the supplier to temporarily 
use a global surrogate number. The HHS/OIG examined a sample of services for which 
a surrogate number was used for claims for the purchase of durable medical equipment, 
prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. The HHS/OIG found that for 61 percent of 
services, the ordering physician had a permanent UPIN that should have been included 
on the claim; for one-third of these, the physician had the UPIN for at least 
5 years. In addition, supporting documentation was missing or incomplete for 45 
percent of the sampled services. Medicare paid an estimated $61 million for services 
billed with surrogate numbers that had missing or incomplete documentation in 
1999. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS perform targeted reviews of claims and 
continue to educate suppliers and ordering physicians about the use of accurate 
UPINs, and CMS concurred. </ul><p><b><u>Other Judgments and Settlements.</u></b></p>In 
addition to the significant enforcement actions described in the Program Accomplishments 
section of this report, and those immediately above, HHS/OIG conducted or participated 
in numerous investigations that resulted in prosecution or settlement during 2003, 
involving all aspects of the health care industry. These include: <br><br> <b>Kickbacks:</b> 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the HHS/OIG to impose civil monetary 
penalties against those who pay or receive remuneration in violation of the anti-kickback 
statute. During 2003, the HHS/OIG stepped up enforcement efforts under this administrative 
authority. Among these actions were: <ul> <li><b>Cardiology Consultants, P.A.</b> 
and its member physicians agreed to pay $611,000 in settlement of their administrative 
liability for possible kickbacks and physician self-referrals. The HHS/OIG alleged 
that the cardiology group paid hourly fees to physicians who were not members 
of their practice group. The contracting physicians monitored cardiac stress tests. 
The OIG alleged that the payments to the contracting physicians were in excess 
of fair market value and were not commercially reasonable. In addition to the 
settlement payment, the group agreed to lower its monitoring fees and entered 
into a 3-year CIA. <br><br> <li><b>Inland Empire Lithotripsy, LLC</b> (formerly 
Inland Empire Lithotripsy, Inc.) self-disclosed conduct to the HHS/OIG and agreed 
to pay $404,538 and enter into a 3-year CIA to resolve its liability under the 
Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP) provisions applicable to kickbacks. The HHS/OIG 
alleged that Inland, an entity owned by urologists, received payments from a hospital 
in excess of fair market value for rental of a lithotripter and provision of lithotripsy 
services in exchange for Inland's referral of Medicare patients to the hospital. 
The OIG has alleged that Inland terminated some of its physician members in retaliation 
for their failure to refer a sufficient number of patients to the hospital. <br><br> 
<li>Five separate settlements were reached with physicians who faced potential 
liability under the CMPs applicable to false claims and kickbacks. In each case, 
the HHS/OIG alleged that the physician received free samples of the prostate cancer 
drug Lupron from TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., and billed at least some of 
those samples to Medicare and other payers. Settlement amounts with the five physicians 
ranged from $40,000 to $95,000. Each entered into a CIA with the HHS/OIG. </ul><h2 align="center"><a name="412"></a>Office 
of the General Counsel </h2><p>The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) was allocated 
$4.53 million in HCFAC funding to support the Department's program integrity activities. 
These funds were used primarily for litigation activity, both administrative and 
judicial.</p><p><b>Accomplishments</b>:</p><p><em>Litigation</em></p><ul> <li>In 
nursing home enforcement, OGC opened 568 new administrative cases before the Departmental 
Appeals Board (DAB) in FY 2003, an increase of 83 percent over FY 2002. CMPs against 
nursing homes totaled over $12 million, resulting from favorable DAB decisions 
and negotiated settlements. There were also twenty-five federal court cases opened 
as a result of nursing home enforcement actions.</li></ul><p><em>False Claims 
and Qui Tam Actions</em></p><ul> <li>OGC reviewed FCA qui tam claims to determine 
whether there was a failure to comply with Medicare or Medicaid statutes, regulations, 
program instructions, and general policies. For example, in 2003, OGC participated 
in FCA and related administrative matters involving HCA, Inc. that resulted in 
recovery of $891 million which, when added to previous recoveries, culminated 
in a total of over $1.7 billion obtained from the company over the past several 
years.</li></ul><p><em>Medicare Secondary Payer</em></p><ul> <li>OGC is involved 
in substantial product liability or tort claims brought against the tortfeasors 
as self-insured entities and/or their insurance companies. Challenges to Medicare's 
right to recover have arisen in the silicone breast implant litigation, <u>In 
re Dow Corning Corp.</u> and <u>United States v. Baxter HealthCare</u> (11th Cir.); 
the orthopedic bone screw case, <u>Fanning v. United States</u> (3rd Cir); defective 
product claim, <u>Thompson v. Goetzmann</u> (5th Cir); medical malpractice lawsuit, 
<u>Brown v. Thompson</u> (4th Cir.); beneficiary class action, <u>Nygren. v. United 
States</u> and in several other cases.</li><li>OGC continues successful Medicare 
Secondary Payer (MSP) partnership arrangements with various U.S. Attorney's Offices. 
In one region, OGC received a record number 1,486 new MSP cases in 2003 and is 
handling in excess of 2,000 pending MSP cases. As a result of establishing Medicare's 
right to recovery in some 1,160 cases, Medicare collected over $6.92 million.</li><li>OGC 
assisted CMS' implementation of a settlement agreement that resolved the long-pending 
<u>McConaghy v. Thompson</u> case in the First Circuit. This permitted CMS to 
determine whether Medicare has any MSP claims, and required CMS to be reimbursed 
for such claims before receivership assets can be disbursed to individuals.</li></ul>Policy 
Guidance and Education. <ul> <li>OGC continues to be significantly involved in 
CMS' efforts to upgrade the training of state and federal professionals who survey 
long term care facilities for compliance with Medicare requirements. This includes 
the presentation of training sessions on the legal aspects of surveying to surveyors 
and managers from across the United States and for DOJ and CMS partners.</li><li>OGC 
utilizes established "practice groups" which identify national issues requiring 
policy clarifications and which identify the most effective and efficient means 
of litigating these matters. Practice groups are currently in place for long term 
care enforcement cases and bankruptcy matters. <li>OGC continues to work with 
a U.S. Attorney's Office to assure laboratories whose Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) certificates are suspended/revoked do not continue testing in 
violation of CMS action. </ul><h2 align="CENTER"><b><a name="413"></a>Administration 
on Aging</b></h2><p>In 2003, the Administration on Aging (AoA) was allocated $3.25 
million in HCFAC funds to support the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) Projects, and 
to maintain effective partnerships for detecting and reporting error, fraud and 
abuse. AoA provided technical assistance and support to the 57 SMP projects, and 
national community education efforts, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations, 
persons with low health literacy, culturally diverse backgrounds and persons living 
in rural areas. The SMP projects provided direct and widespread education to older 
Americans through an extensive network of senior volunteers, designed to increase 
recognition and reporting of potential errors and fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs.</p><p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p><ul> <li><u>National Technical Assistance 
Resource Centers</u>: AoA supported four national resource centers that provided 
SMP grantees and the aging network with materials, training, and other forms of 
technical assistance to enhance their efforts to educate hard-to-reach older Americans. 
The Centers focused on outreach strategies for educating minority, rural, low-literacy, 
and non-English-speaking individuals in health care fraud issues. AoA also solicited 
applications for one consolidated National Consumer Protection Technical Resource 
Center to become operational in FY 2004. This new center will result in streamlined 
communications with the grantees and enhance replication of successful practices 
nationwide.<br><br> <li><u>Regional Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program 
Conferences</u>: AoA convened three regional conferences in Alexandria, Virginia; 
Dallas, Texas; and Seattle, Washington to provide guidance and technical assistance 
to SMP grantees; offer networking opportunities with other Federal partners, and 
exchange information on best practices and other innovative activities. <br><br> 
<li><u>Senior Medicare Patrol Projects</u>: AoA developed a new program announcement 
that expanded the pool of eligible applicants to faith-based organizations and 
Federally recognized tribes. This action increased the program from 51 projects 
in 45 states to 57 projects in 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto 
Rico. SMP projects recruit and train retired individuals to educate seniors in 
their communities about how they can help prevent and detect potential Medicare 
and Medicaid error, fraud, and abuse. In 2003, the projects trained approximately 
8,500 senior volunteers who directly educated 505,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 
their communities through over 140,000 training sessions and one-on-one encounters. 
This training included how to read their Medicare Summary Notices, fraud awareness, 
and working with medical providers when potential errors are discovered among 
other topics. As a result of beneficiary educational efforts, the percent of beneficiaries 
familiar with efforts to reduce health care fraud, error and abuse has increased 
by 35 percent since 1997 and the number of beneficiaries who read their Medicare 
Summary Notices (MSN) increased by 21.4 percent. After SMP training, over 90 percent 
of beneficiaries indicated they would be willing to call their provider to discuss 
an error on their MSN. <br><br> <li><u>Consumer Awareness</u>: AoA maintained 
a web site to provide information about Medicare and Medicaid error, fraud and 
abuse targeted to older Americans and community-based professionals who serve 
aging adults and their families. The site promotes consumer awareness and facilitates 
the sharing of information and best practices between Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 
and AoA's grantees and partners. In addition, HCFAC funding supported the design 
and distribution of personal health care journals and education brochures and 
videos in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. A particular emphasis was made 
to disseminate this information to AoA's nationwide network of aging service professionals, 
through a variety of television, radio, and print media events. <br><br> <li><u>Beneficiary 
Complaints and Resulting Recoupments</u>: Over the 12 month period ending June 
30, 2003, beneficiaries reported almost 14,000 complaints to the SMP projects. 
In addition, the OIG reports documentation of over $743,000 in Medicare funds 
recouped during this period as a direct result of complaints referred to CMS contractors 
by SMP projects. Self-reported savings to other payers (primarily Medicaid) were 
approximately $23 million during this period. While it is not possible to directly 
track all of the cases reported and dollars recovered through these community 
education activities, approximately $103 million, primarily in Medicaid funds, 
has been recouped by the program from its inception in 1998 through June 30, 2003, 
as a result of documented complaints. </ul><center><h2><a name="414"></a><b>Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services</b></h2></center><p>In 2003, the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was allocated $23.37 million to fund a variety 
of projects related to fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Of this amount, $10 million was specifically dedicated to combat fraud in the 
Medicaid program.</p><p>CMS has increased its efforts to use advanced technology 
to detect and prevent fraud and abuse and to ensure that CMS pays the right providers, 
the right amount, for the right service, on behalf of the right beneficiary. CMS 
fraud, waste, and abuse projects are described below.</p><p>Payment Accuracy Measurement 
(PAM) and State Children's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) Error Rate Pilot: HCFAC 
funding will allow for twenty-seven states to participate in the third year of 
the PAM project, which develops payment accuracy measurement methodologies and 
conducts pilot studies to measure and reduce state Medicaid payment errors.</p><p>During 
the third year of the PAM project, each of the 27 states will pilot test the CMS 
Model in their Medicaid and/or SCHIP programs. The CMS Model has been designed 
to produce state-specific payment error rate estimates, and through weighted aggregation, 
national level payment error rate estimates for Medicaid.</p><p><b>Accomplishments</b></p><ul> 
<li>In response to the June 2003 all-state solicitation, CMS received applications 
from 27 states to participate in the third year of the PAM Project. All 27 states 
were awarded grants in September 2003. These states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, 
California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, 
and Wyoming. Ten of these states previously participated in the project.</li><br><br> 
<li>Twelve of the states will pilot test the CMS Model in their Medicaid program; 
three States will pilot test the model in their SCHIP program; and fifteen States 
will pilot test the model in both their Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Approximately 
half of these 27 states will pilot test the model in both the fee for service 
and managed care components of their Medicaid and SCHIP programs.</li></ul><u>Automating 
Medicaid State Plans</u>: In 2003, HCFAC funds were allocated to Medstat, Inc., 
to research options for automating the Medicaid State Plan process, from plan 
amendment creation at the state level through the submittal and approval process 
at the regions and central office. This allows CMS to understand the current state-of-the-art 
choices for document management, information flow and analysis, and the timing 
and resources necessary to achieve these goals. A Medicaid State Plan database 
will allow broad and timely access to program information for CMS, the states 
and other partners. <br><br> <u>Waiver Management System Database</u>: In 2003, 
HCFAC funds were allocated to update and improve the current 1915(c) Waiver Management 
System Database (WMSD), including a web-based application for WMSD and to improve 
state long term care data collection and analysis in order to support financial 
oversight and accountability. <br><br> <u>Annuities</u>: In 2003, HCFAC funds 
were allocated to the CNA Corporation for a research project titled, "Collection 
and Analysis of Information and Analysis of State and Federal Policies Concerning 
the Use of Annuities to Shelter Assets in State Medicaid Programs." The project 
uses both qualitative and quantitative research methods to develop a comprehensive 
picture of states' experience with the use of annuities as an asset-sheltering 
device by Medicaid applicants and their spouses. This project also uses a methodology 
to estimate the cost of this practice to the Federal government and the states. 
<br><br> The research includes in-depth interviews and data collection in selected 
states and counties; review of litigation and administrative appeals pertaining 
to annuities; focus groups with seniors regarding awareness, attitudes, and likely 
use of various financing or asset sheltering mechanisms, including annuities to 
cover the costs of long term care; information-gathering from representatives 
of insurance industry groups, elder law attorneys, consumer advocates and others, 
regarding the annuities marketplace, sales practices, the secondary market for 
annuities, and related issues. <br><br> <u>Financial Management Data Redesign 
Project (FMDRP)</u>: HCFAC funding was used to develop and enhance an integrated 
financial management tool that links existing CMSO data systems and tools. This 
tool was developed through a contract with Enterprise Technology Partners (ETP). 
The linked tools contain critical financial, statistical, administrative and other 
data. <br><br> This tool will allow CMSO to better focus its financial management 
reviews, targeting service areas of high financial exposure and supporting the 
key Administration goal of improved financial management for the Medicaid program. 
After CMS has reviewed and tested this tool, it will be rolled out to regional 
offices. <br><br> <u>Medicaid Audits</u>: In 2003, HCFAC funds were allocated 
to CMS to support a series of special Medicaid audits to be conducted by the HHS/OIG 
through an Interagency Agreement with CMS. A total of 16 audits were undertaken 
in states and issue areas specified by CMS. The targeted areas included: upper 
payment limits, school-based claims, adult rehabilitation services, home and community 
based services, and Medicaid administrative costs reported by state agencies other 
than the Medicaid single state agency. <br><br> <u>Medicare/Medicaid Data Match 
Expansion Project</u>: In 2003, HCFAC funds were allocated to the CMS to expand 
upon a joint Medicare and Medicaid data-matching project. The data-matching project 
was developed to examine the health care claims data from health care programs 
that share many common beneficiaries and providers and for aberrancies indicative 
of potential fraud or abuse that may not be evident when provider billings for 
either Medicare or Medicaid are viewed in isolation. The data match enables analysts 
and investigators to see the "whole picture" which, heretofore, had not been possible. 
<br><br> Continued operation of the California data-matching project has resulted 
in an estimated $71 million worth of recoupments and savings. More than 90 potential 
investigations have been opened thus far by program safeguard contractors, and 
are in various stages of development. Given the overall success of the pilot project 
in California, CMS is developing the Medicare-Medicaid data match projects in 
Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Ohio and 
Washington, as well as continuing operation and maintenance of the original project 
in California. <br><br> <u>Medicare + Choice Steering and Discrimination Project</u>: 
In 2003, HCFAC funding was allocated to the Division of Program Accountability 
and Payment (DPAP) to review the Medicare + Choice (M+C) plan benefit packages 
that may deny, limit, or condition the coverage or furnishing of benefits to individuals 
eligible to enroll in an M+C plan offered by an M+C organization on the basis 
of any factor that is related to health status. Statutory and regulatory provisions 
authorize CMS to develop and implement methods for detecting health screening 
and steerage of Medicare beneficiaries. Over the past several years the M+C benefit 
packages have markedly changed and considerable concern has been raised by beneficiaries, 
Congress, and others about the potential for health screening through the types 
of benefits and cost-sharing structures offered to beneficiaries. CMS wants to 
ensure that groups are not being discriminated against or steered into or out 
of certain plans based on their health status. <p> <hr width="70%"> <h1 align="CENTER"><a name="42"></a>FUNDING 
FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</h1><hr width="70%"> <h2 align="CENTER"><b><a name="421"></a>United 
States Attorneys</b></h2><p>The ninety-three United States Attorneys and their 
assistants serve as the nation's principal prosecutors of federal crimes, including 
crimes committed by health care providers. Similarly, civil attorneys in the United 
States Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) are responsible for bringing affirmative civil 
cases to recover funds that federal health care programs have paid as a result 
of fraud, waste, and abuse, with support in those cases designated by the Civil 
Division for joint handling. USAOs also handle most criminal and civil appeals 
at the federal appellate level.</p><p>In 2003, the USAOs were allocated $30.4 
million dollars in HCFAC program funds to support civil and criminal health care 
fraud and abuse litigation as exemplified in the Program Accomplishment's section, 
<em>infra</em>. The USAOs dedicated substantial resources to combating health 
care fraud and abuse in FY 2003. HIPAA allocations have supplemented those resources 
by providing dedicated positions for attorneys, paralegals, auditors and investigators, 
as well as funds for litigation of resource-intensive health care fraud cases.</p><p>In 
addition to the staff positions funded by HCFAC, EOUSA's Office of Legal Education 
(OLE) uses HCFAC funds to train AUSAs and other Department attorneys, as well 
as paralegals, investigators, and auditors in the investigation and prosecution 
of health care fraud. In 2003, OLE conducted courses and presentations on health 
care fraud, including the Health Care Fraud and Affirmative Civil Enforcement 
seminar; the Health Care Fraud Coordinator's Conference (Civil and Criminal), 
the Health Care Fraud Symposium, the Health Care Fraud Special Topics Conference, 
and Justice Television Network broadcast trainings on the medical privacy provisions 
of HIPAA.</p><p><b>Civil Prosecutions</b></p><p>In 2003, the USAOs had 1,574 health 
care fraud criminal matters pending, involving 2,496 defendants. The USAOs filed 
criminal charges in 362 cases involving 531 defendants, and obtained 437 federal 
health care related convictions in 2003. USAOs receive referrals of health care 
fraud cases from a wide variety of sources, including the FBI, the HHS/OIG, Medicaid 
Fraud Control Units in State Attorney Generals' Offices, and other federal, state, 
and local law enforcement agencies. In FY 2003, USAOs received new case referrals 
involving 1,352 defendants, and obtained convictions of 437 defendants. Examples 
of just a few of the criminal cases USAOs brought this past year are set forth 
in the Program Accomplishments section of this report.</p><p><b>Criminal Prosecutions</b></p><p>The 
USAOs use affirmative civil enforcement litigation to recover monies wrongfully 
taken from the Medicare Trust Fund and other taxpayer-funded health care systems, 
and to ensure that the federal health care programs are fully compensated for 
the losses and damages resulting from such thefts. The FCA is one of the most 
important tools the USAOs use for these purposes. The FCA subjects those who knowingly 
present false claims for payment to the government, including health care providers 
who submit claims to federal health care programs, to treble damages and civil 
penalties.</p><p>USAOs receive civil health care fraud referrals from a variety 
of sources, principally the federal investigative agencies that refer criminal 
cases, and by means of <em>qui tam</em> complaints. Under the FCA, a <em>qui tam</em> 
plaintiff (known as a "relator") must file his or her complaint under seal in 
a United States District Court, and serve a copy of the complaint upon the United 
States Attorney for that judicial district, as well as the Attorney General. USAOs 
routinely assign civil AUSAs to every <em>qui tam</em> case filed in their districts, 
as well as any matter referred by a law enforcement agency. At the end of FY 2003, 
the USAOs opened 870 new health care fraud matters (including <em>qui tam</em> 
actions), and had 1,277 matters pending. In order to maximize resources, Civil 
Division attorneys may become actively involved and participate with the USAOs 
in <em>qui tam</em> cases involving more than one district and with potential 
recoveries substantially over one million dollars. USAOs generally remain responsible 
in all other <em>qui tam</em> cases for investigating the relator's allegations 
and, where appropriate, litigating and/or settling the case. In 2003, USAOs filed 
or intervened in 231 civil health care fraud cases. The Program Accomplishments 
section includes just a few examples of the many civil matters that USAOs successfully 
resolved in 2003.</p><center><h2><b><a name="422"></a>Civil Division</b></h2></center><p>In 
2003, the Civil Division was allocated $14.5 million in HCFAC funds to support 
civil health care fraud litigation. (The Civil Division also administers the Nursing 
Home Initiative allocation of $1 million.) Civil Division attorneys pursue civil 
remedies in health care fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, 
the HHS/OIG and the Department of Defense, CMS, and other federal and state law 
enforcement agencies. Cases involve providers of health care services, supplies 
and equipment, as well as carriers and fiscal intermediaries, that defraud Medicare, 
Medicaid, TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and 
other government health care programs.</p><p><b>Accomplishments</b></p><p></p><p>In 
2003, the Division opened or filed a total of 230 health care fraud cases or matters. 
In addition to these new efforts, the Civil Division pursued 442 existing cases, 
often working with Assistant United States Attorneys. A significant number of 
these health care fraud cases have the potential for particularly high damages. 
Civil Division attorneys were actively involved in the recoveries described in 
the Program Accomplishments section, above.</p><p>The Civil Division is also staffing 
and providing a coordination function in the FCA investigations alleging pharmaceutical 
pricing fraud against government health care programs. These matters span multiple 
districts and present myriad legal and factual issues that require substantial 
coordinating efforts of the Civil Division. Since 2001, six cases involving allegations 
of pricing fraud by pharmaceutical manufacturers against Medicaid and Medicare 
have been settled by the government for a total recovery of $1.66 billion.</p><p>In 
addition to their litigating responsibilities, Civil Division attorneys have played 
a role in coordinating and presenting the DOJ's views to HHS as its offices interpret 
and apply the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark laws prohibiting physician self-referral. 
For example, the Division has provided assistance to the HHS/OIG in issuing its 
advisory opinions regarding the Anti-Kickback statute and fraud alerts, and to 
CMS in connection with the issuance of CMS' final regulation on the physician 
self-referral prohibition. In addition, the Civil Division, working with other 
components of the Department of Justice, has provided views on the Pharmaceutical 
Industry Compliance Guidance.</p><p>In addition to these accomplishments, the 
Department's Nursing Home Initiative, coordinated by the Civil Division, promotes, 
among other things, increased prosecution and coordination at Federal, state and 
local levels to fight abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of the nation's 
senior and infirm population. The Department is pursuing a growing number of cases 
under the FCA and other theories involving providers' egregious "failures of care." 
It also is in the forefront in developing the field of elder abuse and neglect 
forensics to improve detection, reporting, training, investigation, and prosecution 
in this emerging area.</p><p>Civil Division attorneys provide guidance and training 
to government attorneys to assure the Department's continued compliance with the 
Health and Human Services Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health 
Information, commonly known as the HIPAA privacy rule.</p><p>Also, the Civil Division 
continues to co-chair, with the Criminal Division, the Health Care Fraud Working 
Group to coordinate the health care fraud enforcement activities of all concerned 
federal and state agencies.</p><p> <h2 align="center"><b><a name="423"></a>Criminal 
Division</b></h2><p>In FY 2003, the Criminal Division was allocated $1.58 million 
in HCFAC program funds to support criminal health care fraud litigation. The Fraud 
Section of the Criminal Division develops and implements white collar crime policy 
and provides support for the Federal white collar enforcement community. The Fraud 
Section supports the USAOs with legal and investigative guidance and, in certain 
instances, provides trial attorneys to prosecute criminal fraud cases. For several 
years, a major focus of Fraud Section personnel and resources has been to investigate 
and prosecute fraud involving federal health care programs.</p><p>The Fraud Section 
has provided guidance to FBI agents, AUSAs and Criminal Division attorneys on 
criminal, civil and administrative tools to combat health care fraud, and worked 
on an interagency level through:</p><ul> <li>coordinating large scale multi-district 
health care fraud investigations; <br><br> <li>providing frequent advice and written 
materials on confidentiality and disclosure issues arising in the course of investigations 
and legal proceedings regarding medical records; <br><br> <li>monitoring and coordinating 
DOJ's responses to major regulatory initiatives, legislative proposals, and enforcement 
policy matters. Examples include issues such as provider education and regulation, 
medical records privacy, Internet sales of drugs and medical products and expansion 
of the Medicare program to provide prescription drug benefits; <br><br> <li>reviewing 
and commenting on numerous requests for advisory opinions submitted by health 
care providers to the HHS/OIG, and consulting with the HHS/OIG on draft advisory 
opinions per the requirements of HIPAA; <br><br> <li>working with CMS officials 
to promote more effective use of technologies and high-tech approaches for combating 
health care fraud and abuse. Examples include co-sponsoring with CMS two regional 
conferences and working with several USAOs to coordinate with CMS during its transition 
to Program Safeguard Contractors for conducting anti-fraud detection work in the 
Medicare program; <br><br> <li>preparing and distributing to all USAOs and FBI 
field offices periodic updates on major issues, interagency initiatives, and significant 
activities of DOJ's health care fraud component organizations as well as periodic 
summaries of recent cases; <br><br> <li>organizing and overseeing, in conjunction 
with the Civil Division, the National Level Health Care Fraud Working Group to 
address fraud in health care and managed care; and <br><br> <li>participating 
in interagency working groups formed to address illicit Internet sales of drugs 
and medical products and nursing home fraud and resident abuse. </ul>The Fraud 
Section has responsibility for handling and coordinating complex health care fraud 
litigation nationwide and is currently involved in national investigations of 
hospitals, medical equipment suppliers, and vocational rehabilitation and health 
care management services, as well as other health care providers. An example of 
a successful Fraud Section prosecution in 2003 follows: <ul> <li>Two chiropractors 
who operated a medical clinic and an operator of a management consulting services 
company were convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and of health 
care fraud in connection with a $5 million fraudulent billing scheme. The defendants 
conspired to increase the chiropractic clinic's income by defrauding health care 
insurers by using marketing techniques to attract patients with "good" insurance. 
The chiropractic clinic then provided health care services based on insurance 
coverage rather than medical needs, and deceived Medicare and other insurers into 
believing that the treatment and services being billed were medically necessary 
and were provided under the direction and supervision of a medical doctor. The 
conspirators were thereby able to evade strict insurance coverage limits on chiropractic 
services. The management consulting services operator, who de facto controlled 
the chiropractic clinic through management contracts and lease agreements, also 
was convicted of engaging in a money-laundering conspiracy and of substantive 
money laundering. </ul>In addition to its litigating responsibilities, the Fraud 
Section conducted numerous training sessions and workshops for Department attorneys 
and investigators, executive branch health care program integrity administrators, 
and state and local law enforcement personnel on the health oversight and law 
enforcement exceptions to the HIPAA medical records privacy regulations which 
became effective in April 2003. In partnership with the FBI, the Fraud Section 
prepared and disseminated HIPAA medical records privacy training materials to 
more than 16,000 state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide. The Section 
also developed a special electronic mail account to disseminate, upon request, 
additional supplemental HIPAA medical records privacy training and guidance materials 
prepared for state and local law enforcement agencies and has since responded 
to more than 1,200 state and local law enforcement agency requests for the supplemental 
training materials. <h2 align="center"><b><a name="424"></a>Civil Rights Division</b> 
</h2><p></p><p>In FY 2003, the Civil Rights Division was allocated $1.98 million 
in HCFAC funds to support civil rights division litigation activities related 
to health care fraud. The Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division 
pursues relief affecting public, residential health care facilities and has established 
an Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect Initiative to carry out the Department's 
initiative to eliminate abuse and grossly substandard care in Medicare and Medicaid 
funded nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.</p><p>The Section plays 
a role in the HCFAC Program and is the sole DOJ component responsible for the 
Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA). CRIPA 
authorizes investigation of conditions of confinement at state and local residential 
institutions (including facilities for persons with developmental disabilities 
or mental illness, and nursing homes) and initiation of civil action for injunctive 
relief to remedy a pattern or practice of violations of the constitution or federal 
statutory rights. The review of conditions in facilities for the mentally ill 
and for persons with developmental disabilities, and nursing homes comprises a 
significant portion of the program. The Special Litigation Section works collaboratively 
with the USAOs around the country and with HHS.</p><p></p><p><b>Accomplishments</b></p><p>As 
part of the Department's Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect Initiative, 
and as an enhancement to the Department's ongoing CRIPA enforcement efforts, the 
Special Litigation Section staff preliminarily reviewed conditions and services 
at 38 nursing home facilities in 19 states during FY 2003. The task in preliminary 
inquiries is to determine whether there is sufficient information supporting allegations 
of unlawful conditions to warrant formal investigation under CRIPA. The Section 
reviewed information pertaining to areas such as: abuse and neglect, medical and 
mental health care, use of restraints and seclusion, fire and environmental safety, 
and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual needs. 
<p>In FY 2003, the Special Litigation Section opened CRIPA investigations of two 
nursing homes: A. Holly Patterson Geriatric Center in Uniondale, New York, and 
Nashville Metropolitan Bordeaux Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. Staff participated 
in ongoing nursing home investigations, including the investigation of Laguna 
Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in San Francisco, California, the largest 
public nursing home facility in the United States, and Bradley County Health Care 
and Rehabilitation Center in Cleveland, Tennessee. <p>The Division sent letters 
of findings to appropriate public officials for our investigations of Banks-Jackson-Commerce 
Medical Center and Nursing Home in Commerce, Georgia; Mercer County Geriatric 
Center in Trenton, New Jersey; Nim Henson Geriatric Center in Breathitt County, 
Kentucky; Reginald P. White Nursing Facility in Meridian, Mississippi; and Claudette 
Box Nursing Facility in Mt. Vernon, Alabama. These investigations involved on-site 
evaluation tours with expert consultants, review of documentary evidence, and 
interviews of staff. Section staff continued to monitor our agreement in Bergen 
Regional Medical Center in Paramus, New Jersey. <p>In addition, the staff initiated 
CRIPA investigations of facilities for persons with developmental disabilities 
including: Conway Human Development Center in Conway, Arkansas; Woodbridge Developmental 
Center in Woodbridge, New Jersey; and Boston Higashi School in Randolph, Massachusetts. 
Special Litigation Section staff conducted tours of the Conway and Woodbridge 
facilities, accompanied by expert consultants, reviewed documents, and interviewed 
facility staff. <p>The Section continued its investigations of the following residential 
facilities for the developmentally disabled: Agnews and Sonoma Developmental Centers 
in San Jose and Eldridge, California; Pinecrest and Hammond Developmental Centers 
in Pineville and Hammond, Louisiana; Landmark Learning Center in Opa-Locka, Florida; 
Holly Center in Salisbury, Maryland; Rainier Residential Rehabilitation Center 
and Frances Haddon Morgan Center in Buckley and Bremerton, Washington; and Woodward 
and Glenwood Resource Centers in Woodward and Glenwood, Iowa. In many of these 
investigations, negotiations toward settlement are continuing regarding the correction 
of remaining deficient conditions. In some of these matters, the Section is reviewing 
voluntary compliance to improve conditions. <p>In 2003, the Section found that 
conditions and practices at two state-operated facilities for persons with developmental 
disabilities violate the residents' federal constitutional and statutory rights. 
Those facilities are: Oakwood Communities in Somerset, Kentucky, and New Lisbon 
Developmental Center in New Lisbon, New Jersey. <p>The Section continued its investigations 
of the following mental health facilities: John Umstead Hospital, Dorothea Dix 
Hospital, Cherry Hospital, and Broughton Hospital in Butner, Raleigh, Goldsboro, 
and Morgantown, North Carolina; and Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, California. 
The Section sent a letter of findings concerning the investigation of the Children 
and Adolescent programs at Metropolitan State Hospital during the fiscal year. 
<p>The Section staff also conducted compliance reviews in ongoing CRIPA cases 
involving a variety of facilities. In each of these cases, staff reviewed compliance 
with the terms of previously filed agreements and court orders. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. 
Facilities for persons with developmental disabilities: Southbury Training School 
(United States v. Connecticut (D. Conn.)); Embreeville Center (United States v. 
Pennsylvania (E.D. Pa.)); Arlington Developmental Center (United States v. Tennessee 
(W.D. Tenn.)); Clover Bottom Developmental Center, Greene Valley Developmental 
Center, and Harold Jordan Center (United States v. Tennessee (M.D. Tenn.)); Southern 
Wisconsin Developmental Center and Central Wisconsin Developmental Center (United 
States v. Wisconsin (W.D. Wis.)); Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes, 
Centro de Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber and community-based services (United 
States v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (D. P. R.)); and Ft. Wayne Developmental 
Center and Muscatatuck Developmental Center (United States v. Indiana (S.D. Ind.)). 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Facilities for persons with mental illness: 
Hawaii State Hospital, the children and adolescent residential services at Queens 
Medical Center and Kahi Mohala Behavioral Treatment Center and community-based 
mental health services (United States v. Hawaii (D. Haw.)); Guam Adult Mental 
Health Unit (United States v. Territory of Guam (D. Guam)); Pilgrim Psychiatric 
Center (United States v. New York (E.D. N.Y.)); and Memphis Mental Health Institute 
(United States v. Tennessee (W.D. Tenn.)). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. 
Other Facilities: New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped (United States 
v. New Mexico (D. N. Mex.)). In addition to its law enforcement activities regarding 
health care fraud activities, the Special Litigation Section is responsible for 
representing the Department and the Civil Rights Division on an inter-agency committee 
on elder care issues. The Section has also participated in public education and 
outreach by speaking and participating at conferences on quality of care in health 
care facilities. <p> <hr width="70%"> <h1 align="center"><a name="43"></a>APPENDIX 
</h1><hr width="70%"> <h2 align="center"> Federal Bureau of Investigation<br>Mandatory 
Funding </h2><p> <p></p><blockquote> <p><em>"There are hereby appropriated from 
the general fund of the United States Treasury and hereby appropriated to the 
Account for transfer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to carry out the purpose 
described in subparagraph (C), to be available without further appropriation (I) 
for fiscal year 2003, $114,000,000."</em> </p></blockquote><p></p><p>Under HIPAA, 
the FBI was budgeted $114 million in 2003 for health care fraud enforcement. This 
money was used to support 878 positions (507 Agent/371 Support), an increase of 
68 positions over FY 2002 (42 Agent, 26 Support.). As the FBI has increased the 
number of agents assigned to health care fraud investigations, the number of pending 
investigations has increased more than 400 percent, from 591 cases in 1992 to 
2,262 cases through 2003. FBI-led investigations resulted in 414 criminal health 
care fraud convictions and 523 indictments and informations being filed in FY 
2003. <p>With health care expenditures rising at three times the rate of inflation, 
it is especially important to coordinate all investigative efforts to combat fraud 
within the health care system. The FBI is the primary investigative agency involved 
in the fight against health care fraud that has jurisdiction over both the federal 
and private insurance programs. With more than $1 trillion being spent in the 
private sector on health care and its related services, the FBI's efforts are 
crucial to the success of the overall program. The FBI leverages its resources 
in both the private and public arenas through investigative partnerships with 
agencies such as the HHS/OIG, Food and Drug Administration, Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, Office of Personnel Management, Internal Revenue Service and various 
state and local agencies. On the private side, the FBI is actively involved with 
national groups, such as the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), 
the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Coalition Against Insurance 
Fraud, as well as many other professional and grass-roots efforts to expose and 
investigate fraud within the system. <p>Health care fraud investigations are among 
the highest priority investigations within the FBI and rank behind only Public 
Corruption and Corporate Fraud in the FBI's White Collar Crime Program Plan. In 
addition to being a partner in the majority of investigations listed in the body 
of this report, the FBI last year launched the Outpatient Surgery Initiative to 
combat the growing problem of fraudulent surgeries performed at certain outpatient 
facilities in Southern California. This nationwide scheme has drawn participants 
from 48 of the 50 states who have traveled to California to have unneeded surgery 
in exchange for a cash kickback, and has resulted in billings to the insurance 
companies in excess of $500 million. The FBI partnered with the NHCAA to collect 
intelligence on the problem, and launched a nationwide investigation. As part 
of the initiative, the FBI teamed with a media outlet to profile the matter on 
television in an effort to stem the tide of willing participants and expose the 
fraud to the public. <p>The majority of HIPAA funding received by the FBI is used 
to pay personnel costs associated with the 878 funded positions. Funds not used 
directly for personnel matters are used to provide operational support for major 
health care fraud investigations and national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical 
fraud, outpatient surgery centers, and transportation providers. Further, the 
FBI continues to support individual investigative needs such as the purchase of 
specialized equipment and expert witness testimony on an as-needed basis. <br><br>
