<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The detection and elimination 
    of health care fraud and abuse is a top priority of Federal law enforcement. 
    Our efforts to combat fraud were consolidated and strengthened considerably 
    by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). 
    HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC 
    or the Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the 
    Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<A href="#N_1_"><SUP> 
    (1)</SUP></A>, acting through the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), 
    designed to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement activities 
    with respect to health care fraud and abuse. The fifth year of operation under 
    the Program saw a continuation of the collaborative efforts of Federal and 
    state enforcement and oversight agencies to identify and prosecute the most 
    egregious instances of health care fraud, to prevent future fraud or abuse, 
    and to protect program beneficiaries.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Monetary Results</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In 2001, the Federal government 
    won or negotiated more than $1.7 billion in judgments, settlements, and administrative 
    impositions in health care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these 
    activities, as well as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative 
    impositions, the Federal government collected more than $1.3 billion. More 
    than $1 billion of the funds collected and disbursed in 2001 were returned 
    to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional $42.8 million was recovered as the 
    Federal share of Medicaid restitution. This is the largest return to the government 
    since the inception of the Program. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2><B>Enforcement Actions</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Federal prosecutors filed 445 criminal 
    indictments in health care fraud cases in 2001. A total of 465 defendants 
    were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes in 2001. There were also 
    1,746 civil matters pending, and 188 civil cases filed in 2001. HHS excluded 
    3,756 individuals and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid 
    programs, or other federally sponsored health care programs, most as a result 
    of convictions for crimes relating to Medicare or Medicaid, for patient abuse 
    or neglect, or as a result of licensure revocations. This record number of 
    exclusion actions is the result of successful collaboration with state Medicaid 
    Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) and state licensure boards.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Social Security Act 
    section 1128C(a), as established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
    Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA or the Act), created the Health Care Fraud 
    and Abuse Control Program, a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse 
    in health care, including both public and private health plans. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Act requires that an 
    amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations -- including criminal 
    fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, and administrative penalties, 
    but excluding restitution, compensation to the victim agency, and relators' 
    shares -- be deposited in the Medicare Trust Fund.<A href="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
    All funds deposited in the Trust Fund as a result of the Act are available 
    for the operations of the Trust Fund. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>As stated above, the Act 
    appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund to an expenditure account, 
    called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (the Account), in amounts 
    that the Secretary and Attorney General jointly certify as necessary to finance 
    anti-fraud activities. The maximum amounts available for certification are 
    specified in the Act. Certain of these sums are to be available only for activities 
    of HHS/OIG, with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2001, the Secretary 
    and the Attorney General certified $181 million for appropriation to the Account. 
    A detailed breakdown of the allocation of these funds is set forth later in 
    this report. These resources generally supplement the direct appropriations 
    of HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) that are devoted to health care 
    fraud enforcement, though they provide the sole source of funding for Medicare 
    and Medicaid enforcement by HHS/OIG. (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
    (FBI) received $88 million from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Under the joint direction 
    of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the Program's goals are: </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>As required by the Act, 
    HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the amounts deposited and appropriated 
    to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source of such deposits. In 2001, as a 
    result of the combined anti-fraud actions of the Federal and state governments 
    and others, the Federal government collected a record high of more than $1.3 
    billion in connection with health care fraud cases and matters.<A href="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> 
    These funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and the Centers 
    for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly known as the Health Care 
    Financing Administration, HCFA), transferred to other Federal agencies administering 
    health care programs, or paid to private persons. The following chart provides

  <H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Accomplishments</B></FONT></H3>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>2001 marked the fifth year 
    of the Program. During those five years, the Program's accomplishments have 
    been impressive. Over $2.9 billion has been returned to the Medicare Trust 
    Fund. In 1999, the Trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund extended their estimate 
    of the financial life of the fund by 30 years. One of the primary contributing 
    factors cited by the Trustees was "the continuing efforts to combat fraud 
    and abuse." (Trustees Annual Report, 1999). Returns to the Federal government 
    as a whole are even larger, over $3 billion. In addition, more than 2,000 
    defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related offenses. Over 15,000 
    entities or individuals were excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid 
    and other federally sponsored health care programs. The Healthcare Integrity 
    and Protection Data Bank is "up and running" and industry guidance and beneficiary 
    outreach have been greatly expanded. These continuing accomplishments of DOJ 
    and HHS and other partners in the coordinated anti-fraud effort, as well as 
    the extensive preventive activities, demonstrate that the increased funds 
    to address health care fraud and abuse are sound investments.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
  size=2><B>Collections</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>During this year, the Federal 
    government won or negotiated more than $1.7 billion in judgments, settlements, 
    and administrative impositions in health care fraud cases and proceedings. 
    As a result of these activities, as well as prior year judgments, settlements, 
    and administrative impositions, the Federal government collected $1.3 billion 
    in cases resulting from health care fraud and abuse, of which more than $1 
    billion was returned to the Medicare Trust Fund, and $42.8 million was recovered 
    as the Federal share of Medicaid restitution. It should be emphasized that 
    some of the judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in 2001 
    will result in collections in future years, just as some of the collections 
    in 2001 are attributable to actions from prior years. </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Working together, HHS and 
    DOJ have brought to successful conclusion the investigation and prosecution 
    of numerous costly health care fraud schemes. Among them, are the following:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>HCA - The Healthcare 
      Corporation (HCA).</B> Formerly known as Columbia/HCA, HCA, the largest 
      for-profit hospital chain in the United States, agreed to plead guilty to 
      criminal conduct and paid over $840 million in criminal fines and civil 
      penalties to the Federal government and the affected states related to five 
      areas of Medicare and Medicaid fraud. This investigation was the largest 
      multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by 
      the government.<BR>
      <BR>
      </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
    size=2>Under the terms of the plea agreement, two subsidiaries - Columbia 
      Homecare Group, Inc. and Columbia Management Companies, Inc. - paid more 
      than $95 million in criminal fines and pleaded guilty to several charges 
      involving a wide range of criminal conduct which occurred at HCA's hospitals 
      nationwide. The criminal conduct charged included cost report fraud, fraudulent 
      billing of Medicare for personnel who worked at home health agencies and 
      other personnel who worked at wound care centers, fraudulent billing to 
      Medicare for patients diagnosed with pneumonia, paying kickbacks and other 
      remuneration to doctors to induce referrals, paying kickbacks in connection 
      with the purchase and sale of home health agencies, and fraudulent billing 
      of Medicare for fees paid to manage those agencies. <BR>
      <BR>
      </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>HCA also paid over 
      $745 million to resolve the civil allegations which included: upcoding of 
      pneumonia and other diagnosis-related groups, hospital laboratory tests, 
      overbilling arising from a series of acquisitions of home health agencies, 
      charging marketing costs as home health community education, and billing 
      for non-covered home health services. As part of the civil settlement, HCA 
      entered into a comprehensive 8-year corporate integrity agreement (CIA), 
      and agreed to divest itself of a hospital subject to exclusion.<BR>
      <BR>
      </FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Vencor, Inc.,</B> 
      one of the nation's largest operators of nursing homes and long term hospital 
      services, agreed to pay the Government a total of $219 million of which 
      $104.5 million resolved civil claims that Vencor knowingly submitted false 
      claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, the military's health care program. 
      This civil settlement concluded a successful joint investigation and negotiation 
      by multiple Federal and state agencies, and represented the largest settlement 
      under the civil FCA to date based on failure to provide adequate health 
      care at long term care facilities. The company entered a 5-year CIA that 
      requires Vencor to adopt a comprehensive quality assurance infrastructure 
      at all levels. Importantly, the government proceeded against Vencor even 
      after the company filed for bankruptcy, stating that the long term care 
      institutions "care for our nation's most vulnerable citizens" and will be 
      held accountable, notwithstanding bankruptcy proceedings. <BR>

    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>LifeScan, Inc</B>. 
      Culminating from a cooperative effort among the Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA), DOJ and HHS/OIG, the United States entered into a global settlement 
      for $60 million with LifeScan, a California corporation that develops, designs, 
      manufactures, distributes and sells blood glucose monitoring systems. The 
      company allegedly marketed an adulterated and misbranded medical device 
      for which Federal (including Medicare, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
      (VA), and TRICARE) and state health care programs paid. The company also 
      pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of FDA laws.<B> </B>To guard against 
      future compliance problems, the government included in the Special Conditions 
      of Probation a requirement that for the next 3 years the company conduct 
      extensive training and internal reviews, and report on these activities. 
      A separate 3-year CIA was also negotiated.<BR>
      <BR>
      </FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Quorum Health Group, 
      Inc</B>. The owner of 30 acute care hospitals and manager of over 200 more, 
      settled a case for $87.5 million for allegedly engaging in fraudulent cost 
      reporting practices in violation of the FCA. The provider used "reserve" 
      cost reports to determine its allowable Medicare costs and then filed a 
      separate set of allegedly fraudulent cost reports to obtain greater Medicare 
      reimbursement. Quorum's successor, Triad, also entered a comprehensive 5-year 
      CIA.</FONT></LI>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>These and other settlements 
    reflect the culmination of investigations that have been ongoing for several 
    years. Though settled in 2001, the fines and restitution generated by some 
    of these cases will not be credited to the Medicare Trust Funds until 2002.

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>One area in which collaboration

    abuse in skilled nursing facilities, particularly issues relating to quality

  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Forensics Roundtable. 
      </B>The DOJ hosted a roundtable discussion of elder abuse and neglect. The 
      roundtable, entitled "Elder Justice: Medical Forensic Issues Relating to 
      Elder Abuse and Neglect," brought together 27 preeminent experts to discuss 
      medical, legal and organizational issues concerning elder justice. The panel 
      of 27 experts represented a variety of professions and areas of expertise, 
      including geriatrics, forensic pathology, family medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, 
      gerontology, nursing, social work, psychology, emergency medicine, adult 
      protective services, and Federal, state, and local law enforcement. The 
      discussion focused on four distinct but overlapping subjects relating to 
      elder abuse and neglect: (1) detection and diagnosis, (2) application of 
      forensic science, (3) education and training, and (4) research. A consensus 
      emerged that an inadequate research base, lack of education, insufficient 
      coordination, and poor planning nationwide have made it difficult to prevent, 
      detect, diagnose, intervene, treat, and prosecute elder abuse and neglect.

      follow-up, may be found at: <A

          and Therapy Services Charges: </B>National Healthcare Corporation (NHC) 
          entered a $27 million civil settlement to resolve allegations that the 
          company submitted inflated Medicare costs reports. &nbsp;The government 
          alleged that the cost reports overstated the number of hours that the 
          nursing staff spent caring for Medicare patients, and that some nursing 
          home personnel were billed as performing therapy on Medicare patients 
          which were not performed. As a condition of the settlement of this case, 
          NHC also entered a 5-year CIA. <BR>

          homes and other health care businesses in Pennsylvania agreed to a 5-year 
          exclusion for his role in providing substandard physical, medical and 
          personal care to residents of those homes. The settlement represents 
          the first time HHS/OIG has excluded the owner of a health care facility 
          based on the owner's responsibility for poor quality of care at the 
          facility.<BR>

          a civil FCA case arising from alleged inadequate care to Medicare patients 
          residing at one of the corporation's skilled nursing facilities. The 
          government contended that the quality of patient care was substandard, 
          including inadequate nursing care for residents with pressure ulcers, 
          insufficient staffing, training and supervision, and missing or incomplete 
          assessments of residents' functional capacity and needs. Under the consent 
          order and judgment, the company will pay $90,000 to the government. 
          More importantly, the company is required to retain an independent consultant 
          and take other steps to closely monitor future quality of care at the 
          facility. To ensure compliance, the approving Court specifically retained 
          jurisdiction until the corporation fully implements all provisions of 
          the extensive order. <BR>

      Improve Quality of Care</B>. The HHS/OIG issued several significant reports 
      assessing a variety of facets of nursing home care. In a study of Medicare 
      reimbursement for therapy services, significant levels of error were found

      home patients. Medicare erroneously paid approximately $48.5 million for 
      medically unnecessary, undocumented and inadequately documented therapy 
      during the first half of 1999. This represented a disturbing overall error 
      rate of 24.7 percent. Enhanced provider education, and focused medical reviews

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Medicaid-Pharmacy Acquisition 
    Costs: </B>Ongoing audits and evaluations have generated information that 
    will be valuable to policymakers<B> </B>who are considering alternate reimbursement 
    approaches. Following up on previous work, HHS/OIG conducted a nationwide 
    review of pharmacy acquisition costs for brand name drugs reimbursed under 
    Medicaid. Most states use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage 
    discount, which varies by state, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for 
    drug prescriptions. This review sought to determine the size of the discount. 
    Based on pricing information from 216 pharmacies in 8 States, HHS/OIG estimated 
    that the national actual acquisition cost for brand-name drugs was an average 
    of 21.8 percent below AWP. In most states, the average discount below AWP 
    for reimbursement of estimated acquisition cost was only 10.3 percent in 1999. 
    If this disparity were eliminated, HHS/OIG estimated that nearly $1.1 billion 
    could have been saved for the 200 brand name drugs (accounting for the greatest 
    amount of Medicaid reimbursement in 1999). </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Medicare-inflated Payments 
    for Prescription Drugs: </B>In Medicare, HHS/OIG studies spanning the last 
    4 years have revealed that Medicare and its beneficiaries pay considerably 
    more than do other Federal health care programs for prescription drugs. In 
    January 2001, HHS/OIG released a report comparing Medicare reimbursement to 
    prices available to the physician/supplier community, the Department of Veterans 
    Affairs (VA), and to Medicaid. The study focused on 24 drugs representing 
    $3.1 billion of the $3.9 billion in Medicare drug expenditures in 1999. For 
    every drug in the review, Medicare paid more than the wholesale price available 
    to physicians and suppliers and the VA Federal Supply Schedule price. In fact, 
    for half of the drugs, Medicare paid more than double the VA price. Medicare 
    and its beneficiaries would have saved over $1.6 billion if it had paid the 
    same amount as does the VA, or $761 million at actual wholesale prices. These 
    comparisons were run again using more current drug pricing information -- 
    the sometimes large discrepancies between Medicare and other reimbursement 
    for the same drugs remained. The study also found that Medicare carriers are 
    not establishing consistent drug reimbursement amounts for certain drugs. 
    The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS continue to seek administrative and legislative 
    remedies to reduce excessive drug reimbursement amounts and require all carriers 
    to reimburse a uniform amount for each drug. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Medicaid Rebates: </B>Medicaid 
    reimburses pharmacies and other providers for the drugs that they dispense 
    to Medicaid beneficiaries. Manufacturers must pay rebates, shared between 
    states and the Federal government, on all drugs sold to Medicaid. The rebate 
    is based on the difference between best price and Average Manufacturers Price 
    (for sole source drugs) or a statutory percentage of the Average Manufacturer 
    Price (for generic drugs). "Best price" is defined as the lowest price at 
    which drug manufacturers sell drugs to any non-governmental, for-profit purchaser 
    and specifically includes sales to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). 
    CMS guidance permits the exclusion of sales to drug repackagers in calculating 
    the best price. However, this follow-up review confirmed that manufacturers 
    were excluding sales to repackagers from their best price, even when the repackagers 
    were HMOs. CMS guidance does not permit the exclusion of sales to repackagers 
    if the "repackager" is not actually reselling the drug, i.e., is, instead, 
    "selling" the drug to a subsidiary or affiliate - in effect keeping the drugs 
    for its own use. As a result, the Medicaid program lost drug rebates totaling 
    $80.7 million. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS require drug manufacturers, 
    who excluded sales to HMOs from their best price determinations, to repay 
    the lost rebates. CMS concurred, and intends to revisit policies on exclusion 
    of sales from best price determinations. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Pharmacy Payments from 
    Third Parties</B>: Millions of Medicaid beneficiaries have other pharmacy 
    coverage through private health plans, employers, non-custodial parents, State 
    programs such as workers' compensation, or Federal programs such as Medicare. 
    Because Medicaid is usually considered the payer of last resort, other insurance 
    sources may be liable for claims providers send to Medicaid. An HHS/OIG study 
    found that States were at risk of losing 80 percent ($367 million) of the 
    payments they tried to recover ($440 million) in 1999 through a "pay and chase" 
    approach. On the other hand, States that did not make the unnecessary payments 
    in the first place safeguarded $185 million against possible risk. Almost 
    three-quarters of States surveyed reported that third parties refuse to process 
    or pay Medicaid pharmacy claims. States say they have more problems with pharmacy 
    benefit management companies than with all other types of third parties combined. 
    The $367 million represents the universe of potentially recoverable claims. 
    In those states where financial records were reviewed, the amount actually 
    recoverable is somewhat less due to coverage and eligibility requirements 
    of third party payers that are not known to States. The CMS concurred with 
    HHS/OIG recommendations to review use of cost avoidance waivers (which authorize 
    Medicaid to pay first and seek reimbursement from private insurers), improve 
    claim formats, and educate third party payers. </FONT></P>

      Agreements</B>. Many health care providers that enter agreements with the 
      government in settlement of potential liability for violations of the FCA 
      also agree to adhere to a separate CIA. Under this agreement, the provider 
      commits to establishing a program or taking other specified steps to ensure 
      its future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules. The duration of 
      most CIAs is 5 years, during which time the provider must submit periodic 
      reports to HHS/OIG. These agreements require a substantial effort by the 
      provider to ensure that the organization is operating in accordance with 
      Federal health care program requirements and the parameters established 
      by the CIA. At the close of 2001, HHS/OIG was monitoring more than 300 CIAs.<BR>

    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Compliance Roundtable</B>. 
      In July 2001, HHS/OIG and the Health Care Compliance Association cosponsored 
      a Roundtable discussion to afford providers and other entities an opportunity 
      to talk directly with HHS/OIG officials about compliance programs subject 
      to CIAs. The meeting offered HHS/OIG an opportunity to describe its CIA 
      policy objectives and receive providers' unique insights on ways to accomplish 
      these objectives without unnecessary burden on the providers. Over 50 health 
      care providers and 30 Government representatives took part in group discussions 
      on topics that ranged from compliance education and training, and compliance 
      program infrastructure, to audit requirements and reporting to HHS/OIG. 
      Participants from both industry and government exchanged ideas about how 
      best to work together to protect the integrity of the health care system. 
      In a related effort to obtain feedback on implementation and maintenance 
      of compliance programs and CIAs, HHS/OIG also distributed a survey to providers 
      that were, at the time, operating under CIAs. The survey sought information 
      relating both to the substance of CIA requirements (such as independent 
      review organizations, confidential disclosure programs, claims review, and 
      reporting) as well as the responsiveness and professionalism of HHS/OIG's 
      oversight. The results of both the survey and the Roundtable will provide 
      valuable information to the HHS/OIG as it reexamines and reforms the CIA 
      process. More information on the results of the survey may be found at <A

    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In response to feedback received 
      from the Provider Roundtable and the survey of providers subject to CIAs, 
      the HHS/OIG developed a plan to modify its role in the civil settlement 
      process. First, the HHS/OIG developed criteria for the provider community 
      as to those situations which would not require a CIA to resolve a provider's 
      liability under the FCA. Second, the HHS/OIG modified the claims review 
      procedures contained in CIAs, and revised the CIA requirement with respect 
      to the use of independent review organizations. Both changes are intended 
      to reduce the financial impact of these requirements without weakening the 
      integrity of a provider's compliance program. These modifications will be 
      offered both to providers which negotiate future CIAs, as well as those

    <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Medicare Error Rate:</B> 
      The HHS/OIG reported that improper payments under Medicare's fee-for-service 
      system totaled an estimated $11.9 billion during 2000. That estimate was 
      the lowest to date and about half of the $23.2 billion that was estimated 
      for 1996, when HHS/OIG developed the first national error rate. The HHS/OIG 
      developed the estimate of improper payments with the support of medical 
      experts who together reviewed a comprehensive statistical sample of Medicare 
      fee-for-service claims expenditures and supporting medical records to determine 
      the accuracy and legitimacy of the claims. <BR>
      <BR>
      </FONT><FONT 
    face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The HHS/OIG believes that since 
      the first error rate of 1996, CMS has demonstrated continued vigilance in 
      monitoring the error rate and developing corrective action plans. Clearly 
      these corrective actions have been successful. The majority of health care 
      providers now submit claims to Medicare for services that are medically 
      necessary, billed correctly, and documented properly. As in past years, 
      HHS/OIG estimated that over 90&nbsp; percent of the 2000 fee-for-service 
      payments met Medicare reimbursement requirements. The HHS/OIG's 5-year analysis 
      indicates that over 70 percent of the claims that did not meet reimbursement 
      requirements were attributable to unsupported and medically unnecessary 
      costs - two areas that will receive ongoing monitoring. </FONT><BR>

      practices in agency programs or administrative processes. As required by 
      the Inspector General Act, HHS/OIG makes recommendations to address these 
      vulnerabilities, and thereby promote economy and efficiency in HHS programs 
      and operations. Relying on the independent factual information generated 
      by HHS/OIG, agency managers recommend legislative proposals or other corrective 
      actions that, when enacted or implemented, close loopholes and reduce improper 
      payments or conduct. The net savings from these joint efforts toward program 
      improvements can be substantial. Many of the studies described throughout 
      this report offered evidence and ideas supporting proposals for significant 
      cost savings during 2001 and beyond. Prominent examples of these reviews 
      include the following:<BR>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Upper Payment 
          Limit (UPL)</B>. States are allowed to pay Medicaid facilities above 
          their cost for a service or procedure, as long as the State's aggregate 
          payment does not exceed the amount that would have been paid under Medicare 
          (referred to as the upper limit). In a series of audits, HHS/OIG has 
          found that some States use intergovernmental transfers as a financing 
          mechanism to maximize Federal Medicaid reimbursement available through 
          UPLs, and effectively avoid contributing the state share of Medicaid 
          spending. Over the past year, CMS has published three final regulations 
          to curb states' use of this loophole. The CMS estimates that the new 
          rules will save $77 billion in Federal Medicaid funds over the next 
          10 years.<BR>

          caps on Part B physical, occupational, and speech therapy that were 
          imposed in 1997. The monetary caps on services coincided with a dramatic 
          decrease in Part B therapy charges during 1999. Preliminary reports 
          indicate that there was a rebound in Skilled Nursing Facility therapy 
          charges in 2000 and 2001. An HHS/OIG study indicated that this rebound 
          is attributable both to the moratorium on caps and perceived inadequate 
          contractor oversight of billing practices and medical necessity of Part 
          B therapy. In response, CMS will take steps to ensure that adequate 
          medical reviews of Part B therapy are conducted and to improve providers' 
          understanding of guidelines for Part B therapy and billings.<BR>

          vulnerability in Medicare's claims payment process -- one that can easily 
          be corrected. The report found that in one year, Medicare paid over 
          $90 million for medical equipment and supply claims with invalid or 
          inactive UPINs. Moreover, a small number of suppliers accounted for 
          a significant share of these charges. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS 
          revise claims processing to ensure that claims contain UPINs that are 
          valid and active. As HIPAA requires CMS to establish unique identifiers 
          for all health care providers, this report recommended that CMS take 
          steps to validate and update UPIN Registry data prior to implementation 
          of the new provider identifier system</FONT><BR>

          or were questionable. An area of particular vulnerability was psychological 
          testing; nearly one-third of the tests were too frequent, medically 
          unnecessary, or utilized questionable testing instruments. CMS has agreed 
          to develop guidelines in these areas, which will both protect the quality 
          of mental health services and could result in a potential savings of 
          $30 million a year.<BR>

          In a separate study, HHS/OIG found that Medicare allowed $185 million

          billed incorrectly, rendered by unqualified providers, and undocumented 
          or poorly documented. CMS has agreed to take steps to identify problematic 
          mental health services for prepayment edits or post-payment medical 
          review, promote awareness of documentation and medical necessity requirements, 
          further refine guidance on a particular testing code, and require carriers

          An HHS/OIG evaluation of 15 procedure codes found that Medicare's claims 
          processing system permitted duplicate payments by more than one carrier. 
          Total improper payments for the sample services were approximately $446,000. 
          HHS/OIG recommended that CMS either revise Common Working Files edits 
          to detect and deny duplicate billings, or, if more cost effective, increase 
          post-payment reviews. A related study disclosed 3,152 services involving 
          potential duplicate payments made by the same carrier, resulting in 
          estimated questionable allowances of approximately $2.25 million. Other

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Health care fraud involves 
    a variety of schemes that defraud public and private insurers and providers 
    nationwide. In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, a number of federally funded 
    health benefit programs have been the targets of these schemes. The fraudulent 
    activity may include double-billing schemes, kickbacks, billing for unnecessary 
    or unperformed tests, or may be related to the quality of care provided to 
    patients. In addition to monetary losses, in some instances these improper 
    activities endanger patient safety. United States Attorneys' offices (USAOs) 
    are responsible for civilly and criminally prosecuting health care professionals, 
    providers, and other specialized business entities who engage in health care 
    fraud and abuse. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>USAOs continue to strengthen 
    and refine cooperative efforts with Federal, state and local law enforcement 
    agencies involved in the prevention, evaluation, detection, and investigation 
    of health care fraud and abuse. In addition to the FBI, HHS/OIG and CMS, USAOs 
    offices work with State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, Offices of Inspectors 
    General for a number of Federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
    the FDA, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the TRICARE Support 
    Office. Each USAO has appointed both a civil and criminal health care fraud 
    coordinator to assist in coordination and to facilitate communication between 
    Federal, state and local law enforcement groups. In addition, many cases are 
    investigated in a parallel fashion, so that potential criminal and civil remedies 
    are addressed more efficiently, by the attorneys and the agencies investigating 
    the wrongdoing. The criminal and civil judgments and settlements discussed 
    in the program accomplishments above were among the many significant accomplishments 
    of the USAOs and are examples of such parallel investigations and prosecutions.

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The primary objective of 
    criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the integrity of our nation's health 
    care programs and to punish and deter those who, through their improper activities, 
    adversely affect the health care system and the taxpayers. </FONT> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Each time a criminal case

    it is opened as a matter pending in the district. A referral remains a matter 
    until an indictment or information is filed or the case is declined for prosecution. 
    In 2001, the USAOs had 1,791 criminal matters pending involving 2,733 defendants, 
    a 7 percent decrease in the number of criminal matters over 2000. During 2001,

    for health care fraud-related crimes in 2001. Health care fraud convictions 
    include both guilty pleas and guilty verdicts. A sample of the criminal cases 
    brought by USAOs, in addition to those set forth in the overview section, 
    is set forth below.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In Florida, a physician 
    was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for conspiracy to submit false claims 
    to Medicare and to prepare false health benefit claim forms, conspiracy to 
    violate the Medicare kickback statute, and for conspiracy to distribute prescription 
    narcotics. The physician was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount 
    of $350,000 and was ordered to forfeit an additional $250,000. The physician, 
    who purportedly ran a pain management clinic, in fact ran a prescription drug 
    "pill mill" which provided drug addicts with large quantities of prescription 
    pain killers. The physician submitted claims to the Medicare, Medicaid and 
    private health benefit programs claiming to have provided non-rendered medical 
    treatment to the addicts. In the same case, the physician's in-house pharmacist 
    was convicted of conspiracy to distribute prescription narcotics and was sentenced 
    to 16 years imprisonment. </FONT> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In Indiana, a podiatrist 
    was sentenced to 68 months in prison following his guilty pleas to six counts 
    of mail fraud for fraudulently billing the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE 
    programs for a number of complex services that were medically unnecessary. 
    In addition to being sentenced to prison, the podiatrist was ordered to make 
    restitution in the amount of $2.76 million: $2.4&nbsp;million to the Indiana 
    Medicaid Program; $504,000 to Medicare; and $16,000 to TRICARE. </FONT> 
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In Florida, the owner of 
    a medical personnel staffing and home health management company was sentenced 
    to 37 months in prison and ordered to pay $923,100 restitution for defrauding 
    TRICARE and Medicare. The investigation disclosed that between 1992 and 1996, 
    the company fraudulently received reimbursements from TRICARE and Medicare 
    for costs allegedly incurred for overhead expenses and direct patient care 
    which were falsely reported as furniture costs, salary costs, Christmas bonuses, 
    and "royalty fees." The company owner, with the assistance of his son, also 
    paid kickbacks to three doctors for referrals to the home health company. 
    </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In Virginia, the president 
    of a medical transport company was sentenced to 37 months after pleading guilty 
    to one count of health care fraud for fraudulently billing the Medicaid Program 
    for approximately $1.4 million. In addition to the prison term, the president 
    was required to pay $1.4 million in restitution, and to forfeit an additional 
    $375,000. The scheme involved the submission of thousands of claims fraudulently 
    seeking payment for the transportation of ambulatory patients who were falsely 
    billed to Medicaid as being wheelchair-bound patients, and the submission 
    of billings for services not rendered and for transportation to destinations 
    not covered by Medicaid. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In New York, a physician 
    pleaded guilty to one count of health care fraud for fraudulently billing 
    Medicare and private health insurance companies for over $10 million billed 
    in a scheme through which the physician billed for "nerve block" injections 
    when in fact he only performed considerably less expensive acupuncture treatments. 
    As a result of the false billings, the physician received $800,000 from Medicare 
    and an additional $600,000 from ten private insurance companies. Pursuant 
    to the plea agreement, the physician has agreed to forfeit $820,000 to the 
    government, repay the private insurance companies $529,000 in restitution, 
    and pay $500,000 to settle a related civil FCA case.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Accomplishments - Civil 
    Cases</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Civil health care fraud 
    efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative Civil Enforcement (ACE) activities. 
    The ACE Program helps ensure that Federal laws are obeyed and that violators 
    provide compensation to the government for losses and damages they cause. 
    Civil health care fraud matters ordinarily involve the United States utilizing 
    the FCA, as well as common law fraud remedies, payment by mistake, unjust 
    enrichment and conversion to recover damages from those who have submitted 
    false or improper claims to the United States. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Each time a civil referral 
    is made to a USAO it is opened as a matter pending in the district. Civil 
    health care fraud matters are referred directly from Federal or state investigative 
    agencies, or result from filings by private persons known as "relators," who 
    file suits on behalf of the Federal Government under the 1986 qui tam amendments 
    to the FCA. Relators may be entitled to share in the recoveries resulting 
    from these lawsuits. At the end of 2001, the USAOs had 1,746 civil health 
    care fraud matters pending. A matter becomes a case when the United States 
    files a civil complaint, or intervenes in a qui tam action, in United States 
    District Court. The vast majority of civil health care fraud cases and matters 
    are settled without a complaint ever being filed. In 2001, 188 civil health 
    care fraud cases were filed. A sample of the civil cases brought by USAOs, 
    in addition to those in described in the overview section, are set forth below.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Seven hospitals located 
    throughout the country agreed to pay the United States almost $5.5 million 
    to settle claims that they unlawfully charged the Medicare and TRICARE programs 
    for surgical procedures using experimental cardiac devices. The devices had 
    not been approved for marketing by the FDA at the time the procedures were 
    performed between 1987 and 1994. The settlement involved hospitals in Florida, 
    California and Arizona. The government had previously entered into settlements 
    with other hospitals engaged in similar conduct and these other settlements 
    resulted in payments of almost $13 million. The settlement stems from a qui 
    tam filed by a former medical device salesman.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In Maryland, a nursing home 
    agreed to forego approximately $436,000 in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements 
    to resolve allegations that the facility provided substandard nursing home 
    care between November 1998 and December 1999. In addition to the monetary 
    settlement, the nursing home entered into a comprehensive CIA with the government. 
    </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>A managed care organization 
    in Illinois agreed to pay $2.9 million to settle civil allegations that it 
    defrauded Medicare by obtaining excessive capitated payments for beneficiaries 
    who were institutionalized. Based upon an audit by HHS/OIG, it was determined 
    that the managed care organization incorrectly categorized some of its beneficiaries 
    living in several counties in Illinois as being institutionalized between 
    October 1, 1995 and September 30, 1997. As a result, the managed care organization 
    received enhanced capitated payments from Medicare to which it was not entitled. 
    A 1998 HHS/OIG audit of a sample of the managed care organization's claims 
    for institutionalized beneficiaries revealed that 29 percent were incorrectly 
    categorized as institutionalized. In addition to the settlement, the managed 
    care organization also entered into a CIA with the HHS/OIG.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In California, two medical 
    practice groups agreed to pay $10.25 million to settle allegations that they 
    knowingly defrauded Medicare, TRICARE and Medi-Cal from 1992 to 1999 by submitting 
    numerous false claims to inflate reimbursement payments from Medicare, TRICARE 
    and Medi-Cal. The false billings alleged included: (1) billing for nonreimbursable 
    annual physical exams; (2) billing for routine doctor "referrals" as more 
    highly reimbursable "consultations;" (3) exaggerating the complexity of "evaluation 
    and management" office visits to obtain greater reimbursement; and (4) billing 
    for undocumented lab work and other ancillary services. </FONT></P>

  <P></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Civil Division attorneys 
    vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care fraud matters, working closely 
    with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors General of the Department of Health 
    and Human Services and the Department of Defense, CMS, and other Federal and 
    state law enforcement agencies. Cases involve providers of health care services, 
    supplies and equipment, as well as carriers and fiscal intermediaries, that 
    defraud Medicare, Medicaid, the TRICARE program of the Department of Defense, 
    the FEHBP, and other government health care programs. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
  size=2><B>Accomplishments</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In 2001, the Division opened 
    or filed a total of 92 health care fraud cases or matters. In addition to 
    these new efforts, the Civil Division pursued over 425 existing cases. A significant 
    number of these health care fraud cases have the potential for particularly 
    high damages. Civil Division attorneys were actively involved in the recoveries 
    described in the overview - HCA, Vencor, Quorum, LifeScan, NHC, and Bayer. 
    The following examples demonstrate the breadth and significance of other cases 
    in which the Division was involved during 2001.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The University of California 
    agreed to pay the Government $22.5 million to settle allegations that the 
    school's five teaching hospitals routinely submitted false billings to Medicare, 
    Medicaid and other Federally-funded health programs. The alleged false claims 
    included upcoding, as well as billing for services purportedly performed or 
    supervised by faculty physicians - when those services were, in fact, performed 
    by residents with little or no supervision.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In another recovery in the 
    ongoing "Operation LABSCAM" investigation, Quest Diagnostics agreed to pay 
    more than $13 million on behalf of Nichols Institute. Beginning in 1989 and 
    ending shortly after its acquisition by Quest in 1994, Nichols routinely billed 
    Federal health programs for laboratory test that were medically unnecessary. 
    Collectively, the Government has recovered over $850 million from the nation's 
    clinical laboratories as a result of LABSCAM and related investigations.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The civil complaints in 
    four qui tam suits against a lab which specializes in bladder and prostate 
    cancer testing were settled by a $9.1 million payment to the Government. The 
    allegations against Urocor included upcoding, unnecessary testing, and paying 
    kickbacks to referring physicians. Urocor will enter into a five-year CIA. 
    </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Following a bench trial, 
    the Government was awarded treble damages and penalties totaling $7.7 million 
    for Medicare fraud committed by Century Health Services, a chain of ten home 
    health care agencies. Medicare permits reimbursement for staff benefits, including 
    corporate contributions to employee stock ownership plans. However, the defendants 
    used the stock plan reimbursements for their personal benefit, leaving the 
    plan barren. The award is under appeal.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In addition to these case-specific 
    accomplishments, the Department's Nursing Home Initiative, coordinated by 
    the Civil Division, promotes, among other things, increased prosecution and 
    coordination at Federal, state and local levels to fight the abuse, neglect, 
    and financial exploitation of the nation's senior and infirm population. The 
    Department is pursuing a growing number of cases under the FCA involving providers' 
    egregious "failures of care." The financial crisis in the nursing home industry 
    has to date resulted in bankruptcy filings by five of the seven largest nursing 
    home chains and several smaller chains. These bankruptcy cases are the largest 
    ever involving health care providers, and raise the specter of failure of 
    care, as well as financial issues. The significance of these cases require 
    considerable and ongoing coordination among the Civil Division's Corporate 
    Finance and Civil Fraud sections, the Criminal Division, CMS, and HHS/OIG.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Also, the Civil Division 
    co-chairs with the Criminal Division the National level Health Care Fraud 
    Working Group, which meets quarterly and coordinates the health care fraud 
    enforcement activities of all concerned Federal and state agencies. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Vital resources were made 
    available from the Account to provide the Civil Division with Automated Litigation 
    Support, auditors, and consultants. These resources supplemented other Civil

    of unlawful conditions to warrant formal investigation under CRIPA. Conditions 
    uncovered at one nursing home will be the subject of a full CRIPA investigation. 
    Inquiries regarding the remaining 28 facilities are continuing. In addition, 
    Section staff are conducting preliminary inquiries of two public facilities 
    for persons with mental illnesses. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Special Litigation Section 
    staff participated in ongoing nursing home investigations, including the investigation 
    of Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco, California, one of the largest 
    public nursing home facilities in the United States. This work involved on 
    site evaluation tours with expert consultants, review of documentary evidence 
    and interviews of staff. Further tours of Laguna Honda are scheduled for the 
    next fiscal year. Staff attorneys also presented oral argument as amicus curiae 
    in a private lawsuit brought concerning Laguna Honda, Davis v. California 
    Health and Human Services Agency (N.D. Cal.), regarding the proper interpretation 
    of the integration regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
    42 U.S.C. § 12131. Subsequently, the court ruled that the integration mandates 
    of Title II of the ADA might oblige defendants to expand community services 
    for Laguna Honda residents and to place them in the community as appropriate 
    to their needs.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In addition, the staff conducted 
    four CRIPA investigations of residential facilities for persons with developmental 
    disabilities: Oakwood Developmental Center in Kentucky; Woodward and Glenwood 
    Centers in Iowa; and Holly Center in Maryland. In both the Kentucky and Iowa 
    investigations, Special Litigation Section staff conducted tours of facilities, 
    accompanied by expert consultants, reviewed documents, and interviewed facility 
    staff. The Special Litigation Section staff are preparing detailed letters 
    which will inform the responsible officials not only of the specific findings 
    made during the investigation, but also of the minimum remedies required to 
    address identified deficiencies. In the Holly Center investigation, negotiations 
    toward settlement are continuing regarding the correction of some remaining 
    deficient conditions. In all of these matters, section staff review situations 
    which may entail alleged abuse and neglect.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Section staff also conducted 
    compliance reviews in four cases: United States v. Tennessee (M.D. Tenn.) 
    involving Clover Bottom Developmental Center; Harold Jordan Center and Greene 
    Valley Developmental Center; United States v. Tennessee ( D. Tenn.) involving 
    the Memphis Mental Health Institute; United States v. New Mexico (D. N. Mex.) 
    regarding the New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped; and Evans and 
    United States v. Williams (D. D.C.) involving dozens of community placements 
    and services for persons with developmental disabilities in the District of 
    Columbia. In each of these cases, staff reviewed compliance with the terms 
    of previously filed agreements and court orders. In addition to compliance 
    activities in Evans, staff were active in negotiating a new consent order 
    and settlement agreement which established the Quality Trust for Individuals 
    with Disabilities, a nonprofit organization independent of the parties that 
    will provide advocacy and legal services to consumers within the District 
    of Columbia's developmental disabilities system. The District agreed to pay 
    an initial sum of $11 million into a trust, and to fund the Quality Trust 
    at a rate of $2 million per year for the first 10 years to allow the trust 
    to grow. The result will be a permanent, independent advocacy organization.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In addition to its law enforcement 
    activities, the Special Litigation Section is responsible for representing 
    the Civil Rights Division in the Department's health care fraud activities. 
    The Section participates, for example, as a Department and Civil Rights representative 
    on an inter-agency Nursing Home Steering Committee. The Section has also participated 
    in public education and outreach by speaking and participating at both national 
    and regional conferences on quality of care in health care facilities.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The health care industry 
    is an attractive target to fraudulent activity which, if not aggressively 
    pursued, can have a significant detrimental effect on the financial stability 
    of the U.S. health care system. As such, successful health care fraud enforcement 
    cannot be achieved by one agency alone. Investigations must be a cooperative 
    effort if they are to be successful in combating the increasing problems of 
    health care fraud. The FBI is actively involved in this cooperative effort.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The FBI works many health 
    care fraud cases on a joint basis with other Federal agencies, including the 
    HHS/OIG. These two Federal agencies collaborate through attendance at health 
    care fraud working groups, attend each others training conferences, and have 
    a liaison program between the two organizations. In addition, most health 
    care fraud task forces formed by FBI field divisions represent the coordinated 
    efforts between the FBI, state and local law enforcement, Federal investigative 
    agencies such as HHS/OIG, and private industry. The FBI and HHS/OIG continue 
    to share a common commitment to ending fragmented health care fraud enforcement 
    efforts and encouraging the coordination of investigative resources.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Under HIPAA, the FBI was 
    provided $88 million in 2001 for health care fraud enforcement. This money 
    was used to support 776 positions (445 agents) funded in prior years and an 
    additional </FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>48 positions 
    (30 agent) in 2001. Currently, the FBI has 14 dedicated health care fraud 
    squads across the country. As the FBI has increased the number of agents assigned 
    to health care fraud investigations, the number of pending investigations 
    has increased over 400 percent rising from 591 cases in 1992 to 2,870 cases 
    through 2001. The FBI is the only Federal investigative agency to have jurisdiction 
    over both government sponsored health care programs and privately funded health 
    care programs. Criminal health care fraud convictions resulting from FBI investigations 
    has risen from 116 in 1992, to </FONT><FONT 
  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>650 through 2001.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Health care fraud investigations 
    are among the highest priority investigations within the FBI. The investigations 
    are generally complex and require specific knowledge, skills and abilities 
    to successfully investigate. Often, sophisticated, innovative, and creative 
    ideas are needed to combat and eventually prosecute the perpetrators of these 
    crimes. As the complexity and long-term nature of health care fraud investigations 
    increase, the FBI anticipates that the number of FBI investigations and convictions 
    will begin to level off.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>A considerable portion of 
    the increased funding was utilized to support major health care fraud investigations. 
    In addition, operational support has been provided for FBI national initiatives 
    focusing on pharmaceutical diversion, chiropractic fraud, medical clinics, 
    and transportation providers. Further, the FBI continues to support individual 
    field offices with equipment and to assist in various individual investigations.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The funding made available 
    through HIPAA also made possible a health care fraud Managers Conference and 
    several Regional Training Conferences for FBI Agents and Professional Support 
    assigned to health care investigations. These training sessions provided in-depth 
    training on the Medicare program and current health care fraud trends and 
    issues to approximately 300 investigative personnel. Other training made possible 
    by HIPAA included: training sessions on data mining and Medicaid fraud. Further, 
    HIPAA funding was utilized to fund training sponsored by various private organizations.</FONT></P>
