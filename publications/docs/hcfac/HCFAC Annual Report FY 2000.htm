      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    </CENTER>
  </H1>
  <HR width="70%">
  <P>The detection and elimination of health care fraud and abuse is a top priority 
    of federal law enforcement. Our efforts to combat fraud were consolidated 
    and strengthened considerably by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
    Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse 
    Control Program (the Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney General 
    and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<A href="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, 
    acting through the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed to coordinate 
    federal, state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health 
    care fraud and abuse. The fourth year of operation under the Program saw a 
    continuation of the collaborative efforts of Federal and state enforcement 
    and oversight agencies to identify and prosecute the most egregious instances 
    of health care fraud, to prevent future fraud or abuse, and to protect program 
    beneficiaries. 
  <P><STRONG>Monetary Results</STRONG> 
  <P>In 2000, the federal government won or negotiated more than $1.2 billion 
    in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care fraud 
    cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well as prior year 
    judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the federal government 
    in 2000 collected $717 million. More than $577 million of the funds collected 
    and disbursed in 2000 were returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional 
    $27 million was recovered as the federal share of Medicaid restitution. 
  <P><STRONG>Enforcement Actions</STRONG> 
  <P>Federal prosecutors filed 457 criminal indictments in health care fraud cases 
    in 2000 -- a 23 percent increase over the previous year. A total of 467 defendants 
    were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes in 2000. There were also 
    1,995 civil matters pending, and 233 civil cases filed in 2000. In 2000, HHS 
    excluded 3,350 individuals and entities from participating in the Medicare 
    and Medicaid programs, or other federally sponsored health care programs.

      <STRONG><U><FONT size=+1>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</FONT></U></STRONG> 
    </CENTER>
  <P> 
  <P>The Social Security Act Section 1128C(a), as established by the Health Insurance 
    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA or the Act), 
    created the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (the Program), a far-reaching 
    program to combat fraud and abuse in health care, including both public and 
    private health plans. 
  <P>The Act requires that an amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations 
    -- including criminal fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, 
    and administrative penalties, but excluding restitution, compensation to the 
    victim agency, and relators' shares -- be deposited in the Medicare<A href="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
    Trust Fund. All funds deposited in the Trust Fund as a result of the Act are 
    available for the operations of the Trust Fund. 
  <P>As stated above, the Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund 
    to a newly created expenditure account, called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse 
    Control Account (the Account), in amounts that the Secretary and Attorney 
    General jointly certify certain sums as necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. 
    The maximum amounts available for certification are specified in the Act. 
    Certain of these sums are to be available only for activities of the HHS/OIG, 
    with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2000, the Secretary and 
    the Attorney General certified $158 million for appropriation to the Account. 
    A detailed breakdown of the allocation of these funds is set forth later in 
    this report. These resources generally supplement the direct appropriations 
    of HHS and DOJ that are devoted to health care fraud enforcement, though they 
    provide the sole source of funding for Medicare and Medicaid enforcement by 
    the HHS/OIG. (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received 
    $76 million from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.) 
  <P>Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the 
    Program's goals are: 
  <P>(1) to coordinate federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating 
    to health care fraud and abuse; 
  <P>(2) to conduct investigations, audits, and evaluations relating to the delivery 
    of and payment for health care in the United States; 
  <P>(3) to facilitate enforcement of all applicable remedies for such fraud; 
  <P>(4) to provide guidance to the health care industry regarding fraudulent 
    practices; and 
  <P>(5) to establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse 
    actions against health care providers. 
  <P>The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit a joint 
    annual report to the Congress which identifies: 
  <P>(A) the amounts appropriated to the HI Trust Fund for the previous fiscal 
    year under various categories and the source of such amounts; and 
  <P>(B) the amounts appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use by 
    the Attorney General and the Secretary and the justification for the expenditure 
    of such amounts. 
  <P>This annual report is submitted in fulfillment of the above statutory requirements.

      MONETARY RESULTS

  <HR width="70%">
  As required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the amounts 
  deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source of such 
  deposits. In 2000, as a result of the combined anti-fraud actions of the federal 
  and state governments and others, the federal government collected $717 million 
  in connection with health care fraud cases and matters<A href="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>. 
  These funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA), transferred to other federal agencies administering 
  health care programs, or paid to private persons. The following chart provides

  <P>*This includes only forfeitures under 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1347, 
    a new federal health care fraud offense that became effective on August 21, 
    1996. Not included are forfeitures obtained in numerous health care fraud 
    cases prosecuted under federal mail and wire fraud and other offenses. 
  <P>**These are funds awarded to private persons who file suits on behalf of 
    the federal government under the <EM>qui tam</EM> provisions of the False 
    Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sec 3730(b). 
  <P>***Funds are also collected on behalf of state Medicaid programs and private 
    insurance companies; these funds are not represented here. 
  <P> 
  <P>The above transfers include certain collections, or amounts equal to certain 
    collections, required by HIPAA to be deposited directly into the Medicare 
    Trust Fund. These amounts include: 
  <P>(1) Gifts and bequests made unconditionally to the Trust Fund, for the benefit 
    of the Account or any activity financed through the Account; 
  <P>(2) Criminal fines recovered in cases involving a federal health care offense, 
    including collections under 1347 of title 18, U.S.C. (relating to health care 
    fraud); 
  <P>(3) Civil monetary penalties in cases involving a federal health care offense; 
  <P>(4) Amounts resulting from the forfeiture of property by reason of a federal 
    health care offense, including collections under section 982(a)(6) of title 
    18, U.S.C.; 
  <P>(5) Penalties and damages obtained and otherwise creditable to miscellaneous 
    receipts of the general fund of the Treasury obtained under sections 3729 
    through 3733 Title 31, United States Code (known as the False Claims Act), 
    in cases involving claims related to the provision of health care items and 
    services (other than funds awarded to a relator, for restitution or otherwise 
    authorized by law). 
  <P>HIPAA requires an independent review of these deposits by the General Accounting 
    Office (GAO).On July 31, 2000, GAO submitted its report to the Congress covering 
    Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999, concluding generally that reported transactions 
    were properly related to HIPAA activities, and that there were no material 
    weaknesses identified in HHS and DOJ processes for accumulating HCFAC financial 
    information.

  <P><STRONG>Collections</STRONG> 
  <P>During this year, the federal government won or negotiated more than $1.2 
    billion in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health 
    care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well 
    as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the 
    federal government in 2000 collected $717 million in cases resulting from 
    health care fraud and abuse, of which more than $577 million was returned 
    to the Medicare Trust Fund, and $27 million was recovered as the federal share 
    of Medicaid restitution. It should be emphasized that some of the judgments, 
    settlements, and administrative impositions in 2000 will result in collections 
    in future years, just as some of the collections in 2000 are attributable 
    to actions from prior years. 
  <P> 
  <P><STRONG>Judgments/Settlements</STRONG> 
  <P>Working together, we have brought to successful conclusion the investigation 
    and prosecution of numerous costly health care fraud schemes. Among them, 
    are the following. 
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>The world's largest provider of kidney dialysis products and services 
      agreed to pay the United States government $486 million to resolve a sweeping 
      investigation of health care fraud. The criminal fine and the civil settlement 
      are the largest ever recovered by the United States in a healthcare fraud 
      investigation. Two former Vice Presidents of the company have pled guilty 
      and other executives were indicted and are awaiting trial. Under the criminal 
      plea agreement, the company agreed to pay a record $101 million in criminal 
      fines for submitting false claims to Medicare for nutritional therapy provided 
      to patients during their dialysis treatments, for hundreds of thousands 
      of fraudulent blood testing claims, and for kickbacks. Under the civil settlements, 
      the successor company will pay a record setting $385 million to resolve 
      civil claims relating to nutritional therapy, kickbacks, blood laboratory 
      tests, improper reporting of credit balances, and billing for services that 
      were provided to dialysis patients as part of clinical studies. The civil 
      settlements compensate the United States for damages to five federal health 
      insurance programs -- Medicare, U.S. Railroad Retirement Board Medicare, 
      Tricare, the Veterans Administration and the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
      Program (FEHBP) – and also pay for damages to state Medicaid programs. The 
      company also agreed to a comprehensive eight year corporate integrity agreement. 
      The investigation, audit and prosecution spanned 5 years, and its success 
      was the result of collaboration among many government organizations, including 
      the HHS-OIG, the FBI, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), 
      the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor, 
      Office of Inspector General, Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. 
      Attorney's Offices and the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.

    <LI>The government entered a global settlement agreement with the nation's 
      largest operator of nursing homes to resolve allegations that it fabricated 
      records to make it appear that nurses were devoting much more time to Medicare 
      patients than they actually were. Although the company received an estimated 
      $400 million in overpayments from Medicare, the settlement requires the 
      company to pay $170 million in civil settlement, a figure negotiated based 
      on the chain's limited ability to pay. Because of their financial position, 
      repayment of most of this amount will be accomplished through reduction 
      of future Medicare payments. In addition, the company entered one of the 
      most comprehensive corporate integrity agreements established to date, an 
      agreement that will remain in effect until the company has fulfilled all 
      of its payment obligations under the civil settlement (an estimated eight 
      years). In addition, a subsidiary company, which owns 10 nursing homes, 
      entered guilty pleas for wire fraud and false statements, and agreed to 
      pay $5 million in fines. The company must divest the 10 nursing homes to 
      unrelated qualified operators approved by the government. While divestiture 
      is being accomplished, other terms of the agreement will ensure that residents 
      receive high quality care. </LI>

    <LI>A former Medicare fiscal intermediary agreed to pay $74 million to resolve 
      claims that it falsified interim payments on settled hospital cost reports 
      in order to meet HCFA's Contractor Performance Evaluation standards. In 
      so doing, the contractor caused improper Medicare payments or reduced offsets 
      to a number of hospitals, overpayments that exceeded $30 million. Since 
      this settlement, HCFA has opted not to renew this fiscal intermediary contract. 
      The company continues to operate under a corporate integrity agreement. 
      Since 1993, over one dozen investigations of Medicare contractors under 
      the False Claims Act have been resolved, with recoveries exceeding $350 
      million. </LI>

    <LI>A prominent Texas doctor, his attorney brother, their mutual certified 
      public accountant, a physician's assistant, a physical therapist, office 
      managers and respective patients, and staff as well as clients were engaged 
      in a sophisticated scheme to defraud local, state and federal government 
      health programs, and private insurers, of over $46 million from 1986 to 
      1998. The conspiracy involved a large cross-referral scheme of auto-accident, 
      personal injury and workers compensation patients/clients between the brothers. 
      Potential auto-accident victims were telephoned using information obtained 
      from police accident reports, which is illegal in Texas. Callers would solicit 
      the accident victims to become clients of the attorney and later patients 
      of his brother. Once the victims were solicited, the medical services were 
      inflated in order to generate higher insurance settlements. Medical and 
      legal services relating to workers compensation claims were also fabricated 
      or inflated. With the assistance of their CPA, the fraudulent proceeds were 
      laundered by diverting them through a series of bank accounts and businesses 
      within the United States, Mexico and the Cayman Islands.<BR>
      <BR>
      An FBI computer analysis of the billing records indicated that the doctor 
      consistently upcoded his services, falsified medical reports and engaged 
      in multiple billing. He billed for over $1 million in office visits when 
      he was out of town. During 1994, he would have had to work approximately 
      90 hours a day to accomplish the number of office visits he claimed to perform. 
      As a result of this scheme, the brothers were paid over $34 million and 
      laundered over $31 million. After a five year inter-agency investigation 
      -- with the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the United 
      States Department of Labor, the United States Postal Inspection Service, 
      the United States Marshals Service, the DCIS, the Cayman Island Government, 
      the El Paso Police Department, the Texas Workers Compensation Commission 
      and private insurance company investigators participating – nine subjects 
      were indicted, and over $2 million in property and cash were seized and 
      forfeited. Of the nine indicted, four pleaded guilty, one was acquitted 
      and on May 12, 2000, four were convicted. Both brothers were convicted and 
      sentenced to steep fines, forfeitures and restitution, and prison. </LI>

  <P>These and other settlements reflect the culmination of investigations that 
    have been ongoing for several years. Though settled in 2000 the fines and 
    restitution generated by some of these cases will not be credited to the Medicare 
    Trust Funds until 2001. 
  <P><STRONG>Collaboration</STRONG> 
  <P>Effective health care fraud and abuse control requires close collaboration 
    and regular exchanges of information among federal, state and local law enforcement 
    entities. One example of such collaborative effort is the National Health 
    Care Fraud and Abuse Task Force. Chaired by the Deputy Attorney General, the 
    task force brought together top officials from federal, state and local law 
    enforcement agencies responsible for fighting health care fraud and abuse, 
    among them, the Department of Health and Human Services, Federal Bureau of 
    Investigation; the National Association of Attorneys General, the National 
    District Attorneys Association; and National Association of Medicaid Fraud 
    Control Units. The task force was designed to foster communication and coordination 
    at the highest levels where policy development and implementation can make 
    a significant difference. At their initial meeting in 1999, the Task Force 
    set various goals toward working together to protect the vulnerable nursing 
    home population and in stepping up efforts to exclude dishonest providers 
    from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health programs. 
  <P>During Fiscal Year 2000, significant progress was made toward accomplishing 
    those goals. Though the following are by no means the only collaborative efforts 
    undertaken to combat health care fraud and abuse, they are illustrative: 
  <P> 
  <DD><STRONG>Nursing Home Training.</STRONG> A series of regional training conferences 
    were held over the course of 1999 and 2000, that brought together over 800 
    representatives of federal, state, and local law enforcement, regulatory, 
    survey, oversight and advocacy entities. During the conferences, State Working 
    Groups (SWG) were formed (or expanded where they existed), including representatives 
    of the many entities that play a role in nursing home quality of care. These 
    SWGs provide an on-going opportunity to promote quality of care by establishing 
    a forum for key players to meet, share information and skills, identify problem 
    facilities, best practices, and ways to address quality of care given the 
    unique situations in the various states. In June 2000, a national meeting 
    of representatives of state working groups' was held to address the challenges 
    and successes of training programs for prosecutors, investigators and other 
    law enforcement officials, with an emphasis on the development of "best practices" 
    and the use of inter-agency efforts to combat health care fraud. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Data Tech Conference.</STRONG> The National Health Care Fraud Task 
    Force called for an examination of the use of information technology in detecting 
    health care fraud and abuse. In June of 2000, HCFA and DOJ fulfilled this 
    goal by co-sponsoring a national conference, which explored technologies and 
    approaches to combat health care fraud and abuse in the 21st Century. The 
    conference drew nearly 300 attendees from a wide universe of health care program 
    and law enforcement officials dedicated to combating fraud and abuse in Medicare, 
    Medicaid, and other government health programs. Attendees included staff from 
    HCFA Central and Regional Offices, Medicare contractors, TRICARE, Medicaid 
    State Agencies, other Federal health programs, State Medicaid Fraud Control 
    Units, U.S. Attorney's Offices, the FBI, the DCIS, the HHS/OIG and other federal 
    and state law enforcement agencies. 
  <DD>The conference focused on two basic themes. The first was an exploration 
    of where technology is driving the science of fraud detection in the 21st 
    Century. Tools incorporating advanced data mining, neural networking, fuzzy 
    logic and artificial intelligence hold great promise for identifying program 
    vulnerabilities earlier than ever. The second theme addressed approaches to 
    combating fraud and abuse. Advancing technology makes it all the more vital 
    that all stakeholders involved in combating health care fraud and abuse maintain 
    close partnerships. Because bad actors do not discriminate among health programs 
    they defraud, joint program integrity efforts are increasingly important.

      <LI><B>Stepped up exclusion efforts.</B> Federal, state and local prosecutions 
        are critical to protecting the integrity of our programs by prosecuting 
        dishonest providers. State Licensing Boards play a vital role in protecting 
        quality of care providing to our beneficiaries," said June Gibbs Brown, 
        HHS Inspector General. "Exclusion from these programs is a second equally 
        powerful tool in our fight against waste, fraud and abuse. We will be 
        expanding our efforts to educate prosecutors and state licensing authorities 
        about this critical tool, and the increase number of referrals. In part 
        because of these efforts, exclusions in 2000 were at a record high — a 
        total of 3,350 individuals and entities were excluded from participation 
        in Federal programs. This is a 12.56 percent increase from 2,976 exclusions 
        in 1999. </LI>
    </UL>
    <P>Other significant collaborative efforts during 2000 included:</P>
    <P><B>Drug Pricing.</B> Efforts continue to ensure that the government pays 
      providers only reasonable and appropriate amounts for prescription drugs. 
      Toward this end, allegations of false claims were settled in principle with 
      a major drug manufacturer for inflating reported drug prices. These reported 
      prices are relied on by the federal and state governments to set reimbursement 
      rates for Medicaid; accordingly, the overstated reports allegedly caused 
      providers to submit inflated reimbursement claims to Medicaid. Allegations 
      were also settled that the drug manufacturer knowingly underpaid Medicaid 
      for rebates owed to it under the Medicaid Rebate Program. The company agreed 
      to pay $14 million, and agreed to a 5-year corporate integrity agreement 
      under which it will change its drug pricing practices, and submit to monitoring. 
      The agreement will be finalized when it has been ratified by participating 
      states.</P>
    <P>The HHS Office of Inspector General continued evaluations focused on HCFA 
      methodologies for setting Medicare prescription drug prices. Although Medicare 
      Part B does not cover most prescription drugs, it does reimburse for those 
      used in conjunction with certain durable medical equipment and some that 
      are furnished during dialysis. HHS/OIG studies concluded that the Medicare 
      program could save dramatic sums of money if it reimbursed for the drug 
      albuterol and certain end stage renal disease drugs at the same rate as 
      Medicaid, and achieve even more savings if it could use rates available 
      to the Veterans Administration (VA). For example, savings for albuterol 
      would reach $120 million if Medicaid rates were available to the Medicare 
      program; and $209 million at the VA acquisition rates. Medicare allowed 
      amounts would be nearly halved for five ESRD drugs if amounts were based 
      on the rates available to the VA. </P>
    <P>HCFA's methodology for reimbursing for drugs is set by statute -- very 
      generally, Medicare reimburses for the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of 
      drugs, less 5 percent. HCFA has sought legislative change under which Medicare 
      reimbursement would more closely approximate actual acquisition costs; however, 
      these proposals have not been passed by the Congress. Partly in response 
      to recent enforcement efforts, in September, HCFA alerted its contractors 
      through a Program Memorandum that new, more accurate estimates of AWP for 
      32 drugs were available, and could result in potential savings of $400 million 
      per year. Contractors may take advantage of the new pricing data beginning 
      in 2001. Section 429(c) of P.L. 106-554, establishes a moratorium on decreases 
      in payment rates for drugs and biologicals furnished on or after January 
      1, 2001, until review of a Comptroller General study on appropriate payment 
      methodologies.</P>
    <P><B>Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank.</B> HIPAA mandates that 
      the OIG and Department of Justice establish a national health care fraud 
      and abuse data collection program, for the reporting and disclosure of certain 
      health care related final adverse actions taken against health care providers, 
      suppliers and practitioners. The data collection program, named the Healthcare 
      Integrity Protection Data Bank (HIPDB), has been developed as an electronic 
      system that will collect, store and disseminate reports on civil, criminal 
      and administrative actions submitted by Federal and State agencies and health 
      plans. These Federal agencies and entities are also eligible to query the 
      HIPDB. Although the OIG retains policy oversight authority over the HIPDB, 
      the OIG has arranged with Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), 
      through an Memorandum of Understanding, to run the day-to-day operations 
      of the HIPDB. The HIPDB became operational on March 6, 2000. Since becoming 
      operational, the HIPDB has averaged between 20,000 and 25,000 queries per 
      week.</P>
    <P>A more detailed description of these and other accomplishments of the major 
      federal participants in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA follows. 
      While information in this report is presented in the context of a single 
      agency, most of these accomplishments reflect the combined efforts of HHS, 
      DOJ and other partners in the anti-fraud efforts. The continuing accomplishments 
      of the DOJ and HHS and our partners in the coordinated anti-fraud effort, 
      as well as prevention efforts, demonstrate that the increased funds to battle 
      health care fraud and abuse continue to be sound investments, as well as 
      good public policy.</P>

    <P> 
    <P>Certain of the funds appropriated under HIPAA are, by statute, set aside 
      for Medicare and Medicaid activities of the HHS/OIG. During the fourth year 
      of the Program, the Act provides that between $110 and $120 million be devoted 
      to these purposes. The Secretary and the Attorney General jointly allotted 
      $118.3 million to the HHS/OIG in 2000, an increase of $18.5 million over 
      1999. An additional $916,000 was spent on operational costs associated with 
      the HIPDB. 
    <P>HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 771 prosecutions or settlements in 
      2000, of which 586 were health care cases. A total of 3,350 individuals 
      and entities were also excluded, many as a result of criminal convictions 
      for crimes related to Medicare or Medicaid (581); or to other health care 
      programs (111); for patient abuse or neglect (342); based on licensure revocations 
      (1,646). 
    <P>In addition to the HHS/OIG's role in bringing about the judgments and settlements 
      described in the Overview of Accomplishments, the Department of Health and 
      Human Services acted on HHS/OIG recommendations and disallowed $110.7 million 
      in improperly paid health care funds in 2000. HHS/OIG continues to work 
      with HCFA to develop and implement recommendations to correct systemic vulnerabilities 
      detected during HHS/OIG evaluations and audits. These corrective actions 
      often result in health care funds not expended (that is, funds put to better 
      use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG initiatives). In 2000 such funds 
      not expended on improper or unnecessary care amounted to more than $14.1 
      billion -- about $12 billion in Medicare savings, and nearly $2.1 billion 
      in savings to the Medicaid program. 
    <P> 
    <P>HHS/OIG moved closer to its goal of extending its investigative and audit 
      staffs to cover all geographical areas in the country, particularly those 
      that were previously underserved. During 2000, HHS/OIG "full-time equivalent" 
      positions devoted to HCFAC activities increased from 942 to 1,003 by the 
      end of the year. HHS/OIG opened 14 new investigative offices, with the result 
      that OIG now is physically present in 47 states. 
    <P><STRONG>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</STRONG> 
    <P>The increased resources made available under HIPAA have enabled the HHS/OIG 
      to expand activities designed not just to uncover existing fraud and abuse, 
      but to <EM>prevent</EM> it. Vital prevention initiatives, such as those 
      listed below, inform and assist the health care industry, and patients. 
      Equally important, these prevention activities reduce the government's enforcement 
      costs and program losses. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Compliance Guidance. </STRONG>A key element of HHS/OIG's prevention 
    efforts has been the development of compliance program guidance to encourage 
    and assist the private health care industry to fight fraud and abuse. The 
    guidance, developed in conjunction with the provider community, identifies 
    steps that health providers may voluntarily take to improve adherence to Medicare 
    and Medicaid rules. In 2000, the HHS/OIG developed and released final compliance 
    program guidance for hospices, Medicare+Choice organizations offering coordinated 
    care plans, nursing facilities, and individual and small group physician practices.. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Corporate Integrity Agreements</STRONG>. Many health care providers 
    that enter agreements with the government in settlement of potential liability 
    for violations of the False Claims Act also agree to adhere to a separate 
    "corporate integrity agreement." Under this agreement, the provider commits 
    to establishing a program or taking other specified steps to ensure its future 
    compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules. The duration of most corporate 
    integrity agreements is 5 years, during which time the provider must submit 
    periodic reports to HHS/OIG. These agreements require a substantial effort 
    by the provider to ensure that the organization is operating in accordance 
    with Federal health care program requirements and the parameters established 
    by the corporate integrity agreement. Breach of the agreement may result in 
    a variety of sanctions, including exclusion of the provider. At the close 
    of 2000, HHS/OIG was monitoring more than 475 corporate integrity agreements. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Industry Guidance. </STRONG>The centerpiece of the HIPAA guidance 
    initiatives was an advisory opinion process through which parties would obtain 
    binding legal guidance as to whether their existing or proposed health care 
    business transactions ran afoul of the Federal anti-kickback statute, the 
    civil monetary penalties laws, or the exclusion provisions. During 2000, the 
    HHS/OIG issued 11 opinions. A total of 50 advisory opinions have been issued 
    since 1997. The advisory opinion process serves to enhance the HHS/OIG's understanding 
    of new and emerging health care business arrangements and informed the development 
    of new safe harbor regulations, fraud alerts, and special advisory bulletins. 
    During 2000, information gleaned from the advisory opinion process contributed 
    to the final regulatory safe harbors for ambulatory surgical centers and practitioner 
    recruitment, as well as the proposed safe harbor for ambulance restocking 
    and the special fraud alert on rentals of space in physician offices. 
    <P>In addition, the HHS/OIG has made frequent presentations to industry groups 
      on areas of suspected fraud and abuse and measures they can take to avoid 
      trouble. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG made significant strides toward resolving pending safe harbor 
      regulations. Formal clearance was begun for a proposed anti-kickback safe 
      harbor for ambulance restocking arrangements between hospitals and ambulance 
      providers who transport patients to hospital emergency rooms and a proposed 
      safe harbor under the civil money penalty law for inducements to beneficiaries 
      to protect certain payments by ESRD facilities of insurance premiums for 
      their patients. Two final anti-kickback statute safe harbor rules were finalized 
      for issuance in early 2000 -- one promulgating eight new safe harbors and 
      a series of clarifications to existing safe harbors (originally proposed 
      in 1993 and 1994), and another addressing the statutory exception for shared 
      risk arrangements. 
    <P>In addition, HHS/OIG has made frequent presentations to industry groups 
      on areas of suspected fraud and abuse and measures they can take to avoid 
      trouble. 
    <P><B>"Clean" Audit Opinion:</B> This past year, HCFA achieved an important 
      milestone in financial accountability. In its report on HCFA's FY 1999 financial 
      statements, HHS/OIG issued an unqualified, or "clean," audit opinion. This 
      means that HCFA successfully resolved previously reported opinion issues 
      and that the 1999 statements reliably presented financial information. During 
      1999, HCFA initiated a major effort to validate and document accounts receivable. 
      The project, which was jointly conducted by HCFA, HHS/OIG, and two independent 
      accounting firms, enabled HHS/OIG to report, for the first time, that the 
      receivables balance was fairly presented as of the year's end. However, 
      HHS/OIG found that HCFA and the Medicare contractors still did not have 
      adequate internal controls to ensure that future receivables would be properly 
      reflected in their financial reports. Absence of a fully integrated financial 
      management system also continued to impair HCFA's ability to accumulate, 
      reconcile, analyze, and report financial information in a timely manner. 
      Weaknesses continued in EDP general controls at the HCFA central office 
      and the Medicare contractors, as well as in application controls at the 
      contractors' shared systems. The HCFA concurred with HHS/OIG's recommendations 
      and is in the process of taking corrective action. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Medicare Error Rate: </STRONG>For the 1996 financial statement audit 
    period, HHS/OIG developed the methodology to measure noncompliance with laws 
    and regulations in the Medicare fee-for-service program. The HHS/OIG developed 
    the estimate of improper payments with the support of medical experts from 
    the Medicare contractors and peer review organizations who, with the HHS/OIG, 
    reviewed a comprehensive, statistically valid sample of Medicare fee-for-service 
    claims expenditures and supporting medical records to determine the accuracy 
    and legitimacy of the claims. This resulted in the first-ever, statistically 
    valid, national rate of improper Medicare payments. At HCFA's request, HHS/OIG 
    has continued these reviews annually. For the 1999 financial statement audit 
    period, HHS/OIG reported that improper Medicare fee-for-service payments totaled 
    an estimated $13.5 billion. That estimate is about $1 billion more than the 
    previous year's estimate and is $9.7 billion less than that for 1996. While 
    the latest estimate is higher than the previous year, HHS/OIG cannot conclude 
    that there is a statistical difference between the 1998 and 1999 error rates. 
  <DD>In response to the OIG work, HCFA has demonstrated vigilance in monitoring 
    changes in the error rate and developing appropriate corrective action plans. 
    The audit results also show that the majority of health care providers submit 
    claims to Medicare for services that are medically necessary, billed correctly, 
    and documented properly. For both 1998 and 1999, HHS/OIG estimated that over 
    90 percent of the fee-for-service payments met Medicare reimbursement requirements. 
    While HHS/OIG's 4-year analysis indicates continuing progress in reducing 
    improper payments, there are indicators that documentation errors and medically 
    unnecessary services have been and continue to be pervasive problems. These 
    two error categories accounted for over 70 percent of the total improper payments 
    over the 4 years. The HCFA needs to sustain its efforts to maintain progress 
    in reducing these improper payments. 
    <P></P>
  <DD><STRONG>Recommendations for Systemic Improvements: </STRONG>Frequently, 
    investigations (and resulting civil settlements or criminal prosecutions), 
    audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or incentives for fraud in agency 
    programs or administrative processes. As required by the Inspector General 
    Act, the HHS/OIG makes recommendations to correct these vulnerabilities, and 
    thereby promote economy and efficiency in HHS programs and operations. Relying 
    on the independent factual information generated by HHS/OIG, agency managers 
    fashion legislative proposals and other corrective actions that, when enacted 
    or implemented, close loopholes and avoid ineffective expenditures or improper 
    conduct. The net savings from these joint efforts toward program improvements 
    can be substantial. Many of the studies described throughout this report offered 
    evidence and ideas supporting proposals for significant cost savings during 
    2000 and beyond. Prominent examples of these reviews include Medicaid's upper 
    payment limits, and Medicare payments for home health, as follows: 
    <P><B>Medicaid Enhanced Payments to Public Providers:</B> Based on work in 
      three States, HHS/OIG testified before the Senate Committee on Finance regarding 
      States' use of manipulative financing schemes that exploit a provision in 
      Medicaid's "upper payment limit" regulations governing enhanced payments 
      to certain providers. This issue was brought to HHS/OIG's attention by HCFA 
      officials, who provided information that assisted in selecting States for 
      review. They are also providing technical assistance, as needed, during 
      HHS/OIG's ongoing work in other States. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG noted that some States are using intergovernmental transfers 
      to artificially generate excessive Federal matching payments at the expense 
      of other States and contrary to the intent of the program. These abusive 
      practices increase the Federal share of Medicaid without a corresponding 
      increase in the States' share or in the amount or quality of services provided 
      to Medicaid patients. In response to these findings, HCFA quickly drafted 
      a regulation to redefine the types of facilities properly included in upper 
      payment limit classifications. These regulations are estimated to save approximately 
      $55 billion over the next 10 years. The HHS/OIG also offered recommendations 
      should the Congress want to act to close this loophole. 
    <P><B>Medicare Home Health Services:</B> The HHS/OIG's review of home health 
      services in four States with large Medicare expenditures — California, Illinois, 
      New York, and Texas — revealed that 40 percent of payments for such services 
      for a 15-month period ending March 1996 were improper or inappropriate. 
      The audit report contained various recommendations which HCFA implemented. 
      The HHS/OIG's followup review, conducted at HCFA's request, covered the 
      same four States and used 1998 home health data. That review revealed that 
      HCFA's corrective actions were working, since the improper payment rate 
      had fallen to 19 percent. An improper or inappropriate payment for a home 
      health service is one that lacked a valid physician order, was provided 
      to a beneficiary who was not homebound, could not be documented, or allegedly 
      took place at a terminated home health agency where service records could 
      not be found. 
    <P>HCFA agreed with HHS/OIG recommendations to further revise Medicare regulations 
      to require the certifying physician to examine the patient before ordering 
      home health services and see the patient at least once every 60 days, and 
      to instruct the fiscal intermediaries to collect the identified overpayments. 
    <P><B>Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities:</B> Over the past several years, 
      Medicare payments for outpatient rehabilitation facility (ORF) services 
      increased substantially — from $378 million in 1993 to $572 million in 1997. 
      HHS/OIG conducted an audit of outpatient physical therapy, occupational 
      therapy, and speech pathology services to determine if they were provided 
      and billed in accordance with Medicare requirements. The HHS/OIG's work 
      was supported by HCFA and the medical review staffs at HCFA's contractors. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG reviewed Medicare payments to ORFs for the fiscal year ended 
      June 30, 1998 in six States that accounted for about 50 percent of total 
      ORF payments nationwide during CY 1997. Based on a statistical sample, HHS/OIG 
      estimated that Medicare paid $173 million for unallowable or highly questionable 
      ORF services. These payments were made to beneficiaries who exhibited no 
      functional impairment, evidenced no active participation with the therapist, 
      and/or had no expectation for significant improvement within a reasonable 
      and predictable length of time. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG recommended and HCFA agreed to consider implementing a review 
      process for new providers to include an evaluation of whether the services 
      provided to beneficiaries meet Medicare requirements, consider a periodic 
      recertification requirement for ORFs, and instruct fiscal intermediaries 
      to recover the identified overpayments and review other ORF claims for the 
      sampled beneficiaries and recover additional overpayments. Further, HHS/OIG 
      proposed that HCFA require the intermediaries to provide in-house educational 
      services to new providers, conduct a prepayment medical review of claims 
      submitted by new providers, and intensify medical review of claims submitted 
      by ORFs. 
    <P><B>Focus on Quality of Care</B> 
    <P>HHS/OIG investigations, audits and evaluations focus not just on improper 
      billing for health care services, but also the quality of care provided 
      to program beneficiaries. These efforts include: 
    <P><B>Prosecution and Exclusion of Dangerous Provider.</B> A New York ophthalmologist 
      was sentenced to 4 years in custody, 3 years supervised release and a $75,000 
      fine for conspiring to submit false claims to Medicare. In accordance with 
      his plea agreement, the ophthalmologist also previously repaid the Government 
      $8.55 million, representing the second largest single provider recovery 
      in the United States and the largest in the Eastern District of New York. 
      He was also permanently excluded from participating in the Medicare program. 
      Investigation by HHS/OIG into the ophthalmologist's activities revealed 
      that he performed cataract surgeries on patients who did not have cataracts 
      and performed glaucoma laser procedures on patients who did not have glaucoma. 
      He also billed for other ophthalmological procedures that were either not 
      performed or were not medically necessary. As a result of the investigation, 
      the New York State Office of Professional Medical Conduct revoked his license 
      to practice medicine. 
    <P><B>Vaccinations for Nursing Home Residents.</B> An objective of HHS's Healthy 
      People 2010 public health goal is to increase vaccination rates for influenza 
      and pneumococcal disease in nursing homes to 90 percent. Although Medicare 
      covers both of these vaccines, data suggests that nursing homes fall short 
      of this mark. After evaluating HCFA and the Centers for Disease Control 
      and Prevention's (CDC) vaccination efforts in this area, the HHS/OIG recommended 
      that HCFA consider requiring nursing homes to assess residents for vaccinations 
      upon admission and add vaccination data to the Minimum Data Set which nursing 
      homes are required to collect. In addition, HCFA and CDC can use the Minimum 
      Data Set to identify and reach out to nursing homes with low vaccination 
      rates through their network of regional and field offices which are familiar 
      with local nursing homes and the populations they serve. 
    <P><B>Infusion Therapy Services in Skilled Nursing Facilities:</B> In a review 
      of three infusion suppliers for the period 1995 through 1998, HHS/OIG determined 
      that they provided Medicare-reimbursed skilled nursing facilities (SNF) 
      with infusion therapy services that were medically unnecessary and excessively 
      priced. In addition, the three infusion suppliers billed certain infusion 
      services incorrectly, causing those costs to be misclassified on the SNFs' 
      cost reports. This occurred because the reimbursement system was vulnerable 
      to abusive billing schemes. Patients were placed at undue risk, Medicare 
      overpaid the SNFs, and the overpayments may have been included in base-year 
      costs used to establish the prospective payment system (PPS) rates. 
    <P>The HHS/OIG recommended and HCFA agreed to consider the impact of improper 
      payments for infusion therapy services before making any refinements or 
      updates to the PPS rates, identify and recover overpayments made to SNFs 
      for unnecessary and overpriced infusion services prior to the adoption of 
      PPS, and direct its contractors to perform medical reviews of selected SNF 
      patients to ensure that patients receive appropriate levels of infusion 
      therapy. This work received congressional attention during discussions before 
      enactment of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. 
    <P><B>Patient Anti-Dumping Enforcement.</B> HHS continues to vigorously pursue 
      potential violations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act 
      (EMTLA), also called the patient anti-dumping statute. In 2000, HHS/OIG 
      obtained 48 settlement agreements and judgments with hospitals and physicians 
      and collected civil monetary penalties of nearly $1.2 million. This reflects 
      the continued commitment of both HCFA and HHS/OIG to ensure patient access 
      to appropriate emergency medical services. 
    <P><B>Focus on Mental Health Services</B> 
    <P></P>
  <DD><B>Audits of the Partial Hospitalization Program.</B> Under the partial 
    hospitalization program (PHP), Medicare pays for intensive outpatient psychiatric 
    services for acutely ill individuals who would otherwise require hospitalization. 
    These services can be provided by either hospital outpatient departments or 
    community mental health centers (CMHC). Earlier HHS/OIG audits identified 
    sizable Medicare payments for unallowable or highly questionable services 
    at CMHCs. In 2000, HHS/OIG assessed the propriety of provider claims for outpatient 
    services at acute care hospitals and at additional CMHCs. HHS/OIG worked in 
    collaboration with HCFA and medical review staffs at the Medicare contractors. 
  <DD>The HHS/OIG selected claims from acute care hospitals in the 10 States with 
    the highest charges for outpatient psychiatric services: California, Connecticut, 
    Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, 
    and Texas. In reviewing 200 claims from the 10 States for CY 1997 totaling 
    $168,857, HHS/OIG concluded that $94,716 of the charges did not meet Medicare 
    criteria for reimbursement because they were not documented in accordance 
    with Medicare requirements, not reasonable and necessary, and /or rendered 
    by unlicensed personnel. Based on this sample, HHS/OIG estimated that for 
    CY 1997, acute care hospitals submitted claims to Medicare totaling more than 
    $224 million (approximately 59 percent of the amount claimed) for unallowable 
    or unsupported psychiatric services in the 10 States. The HHS/OIG recommended 
    that HCFA consider implementing a first-claim medical review of a random sample 
    of new outpatient psychiatric claims; require Medicare fiscal intermediaries 
    to increase postpayment reviews of outpatient psychiatric service claims; 
    require intermediaries to initiate recovery of payments for claims found in 
    error; and further emphasize its documentation requirements for all types 
    of outpatient psychiatric services through seminars, educational sessions, 
    and newsletters. 
  <DD>Reviews at five individual hospitals found similar unallowable charges. 
    Based on statistical samples, HHS/OIG estimated that outpatient psychiatric 
    claims submitted over a 1-year period were overstated by about $1.9 million 
    for one hospital, $1.1 million for each of two hospitals, over $750,000 for 
    another, and at least $314,000 for the last hospital. Additional outpatient 
    psychiatric costs claimed on the hospitals' Medicare cost reports were also 
    determined to be unallowable. In all cases, HHS/OIG referred the review results 
    to the fiscal intermediaries for appropriate financial adjustments. The HHS/OIG 
    also recommended that the hospitals strengthen their procedures to ensure 
    that charges for outpatient psychiatric services are covered and properly 
    documented. 
  <DD>A separate review of partial hospitalization services provided by a CMHC 
    over a 1-year period disclosed that 100 percent of the services included in 
    the sampled claims should not have been paid by Medicare, resulting in estimated 
    improper payments of more than $4.4 million. At another CMHC, HHS/OIG estimated 
    that $1.1 million in charges were not reasonable and necessary or not appropriate 
    for the patients' conditions. In addition to recommending financial adjustments, 
    HHS/OIG proposed that the centers ensure that any future services submitted 
    to Medicare for reimbursement are covered and documented in accordance with 
    Medicare requirements. 
  <DD><B>Civil Settlement of Improper PHP.</B> This year also saw a significant 
    civil settlement for potentially improper partial hospitalization claims. 
    A Pennsylvania health system agreed to pay the Government $12 million to resolve 
    its successor liability under the False Claims Act for improper partial hospitalization 
    program billing practices by the hospital it acquired. Initiated through a 
    qui tam suit, this settlement resolved allegations of billing misconduct that 
    occurred between 1993 and 1997. The allegations included billing for patients 
    who were so impaired they were unable to benefit from PHP services; billing 
    for services of a purely recreational, non-therapeutic nature; billing for 
    more time than was actually provided; and billing for improperly supervised 
    services. In addition to paying $12 million, the health system also agreed 
    to extend the scope of its preexisting 3-year corporate integrity agreement 
    for pneumonia upcoding violations to encompass PHP services as well. The health 
    system ceased operating the previous hospital's PHP programs which formed 
    the basis for the case. 
  <DD><B>Focus on Managed Care, and Medicare + Choice:</B> 
  <DD><B>Medicare Managed Care Payments:</B> The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 modified 
    the methodology used to determine managed care organization (MCO) payments, 
    partly because of concerns that many MCOs were overcompensated. MCO industry 
    representatives claimed that these payment changes were too severe. Therefore, 
    at HCFA's request, HHS/OIG, through multiple studies, examined the impact 
    of the changes and reported that (1) the basis on which monthly capitation 
    payment amounts were calculated was flawed, (2) Medicare payments were used 
    to fund unnecessary administrative costs and excess profits, (3) investment 
    income was not accounted for by MCOs in the Medicare payment formula, and 
    (4) improper payments were made to MCOs for erroneously classified beneficiaries. 
    The cumulative impact of these issues is that MCOs receive more than an adequate 
    amount of funds to deliver the Medicare package of covered services. Therefore, 
    HHS/OIG recommended that HCFA use all of this work to modify the present monthly 
    rates to a level fully supported by empirical data. The HCFA agreed with the 
    overall finding that MCO payments are adequate to fund the Medicare package 
    of covered services. 
  <DD><B>First Settlement with Medicare Managed Care Company.</B> As the result 
    of an HHS/OIG audit, a publicly traded Medicare managed care company agreed 
    to pay $14.5 million to settle allegations that the company provided inaccurate 
    enrollment data to Medicare. This is the first False Claims Act settlement 
    that involved billing misconduct in the Medicare managed care program. Specifically, 
    the audit revealed that the company received Medicare payments for Medicare 
    beneficiaries who were members of the company's plans and were incorrectly 
    listed by the plans as dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. As 
    part of the settlement agreement, the company has entered into a comprehensive 
    5-year corporate integrity agreement. 
  <DD><B>Other Judgments and Settlements.</B> In addition to the significant enforcement 
    actions described in the Program Accomplishments section of this report, the 
    HHS/OIG conducted or participated in over 586 investigations that resulted 
    in prosecution or settlement during 2000, involving all aspects of the health 
    care industry. These include: 
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Kickback Cases:</B> A Texas corporation agreed to pay the Government 
        $10 million and entered into a comprehensive corporate integrity agreement 
        to resolve liability for misconduct on the part of two of its Florida 
        subsidiaries. The corporate subsidiaries are mail-order pharmacies providing 
        respiratory medications and diabetic supplies to Medicare beneficiaries 
        nationwide. The agreement settles allegations that these entities made, 
        or caused to be made, improper payments to DME companies for the referral 
        of Medicare beneficiaries and routinely waived coinsurance charges. An 
        OIG investigation and audit showed that from 1990 to 1997, the subsidiaries 
        made payments to numerous DME companies and individuals to induce the 
        companies to refer patients to them for the purchase of supplies. The 
        patients typically referred were patients to whom the DME companies previously 
        provided medical equipment and oxygen. Both defendant corporations also 
        routinely waived certain coinsurance amounts in connection with their 
        sale of respiratory medication. 
      <LI><B>Contractor Impropriety:</B> A regional Medicare carrier agreed to 
        pay the Government close to $9 million for allegedly submitting false 
        administrative cost reports, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement 
        with the HHS/OIG. The company improperly charged HCFA for unallowable 
        costs in connection with its Medicare carrier contract with the agency, 
        and thereby received overpayments for costs incurred in operating the 
        Medicare program. The HHS/OIG investigation and audit substantiated that 
        the company knowingly over-counted costs incurred in printing Medicare 
        checks and explanation of benefits forms, and charged HCFA for unallowable 
        overhead costs (including risk insurance costs that were never incurred). 
        During the HHS/OIG audit, the company knowingly failed to disclose these 
        known overcharges. </LI>

      tests on human specimens, and certify through issuance of a certificate, 
      that those laboratories meet the certificate requirements established by 
      the Department. Laboratories holding CLIA certificates are subject to inspections

        effectively insure that Medicare reimbursement for partial hospitalization 
        (an intensive and multimodal program of services intended for individuals 
        who would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care) would only be 
        made to CMHCs and prospective CMHCs which met applicable statutory and

  <P>Health care fraud involves a variety of schemes that defraud public and private 
    insurers and providers nationwide. In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, a 
    number of federally funded health benefit programs have been the targets of 
    these schemes. The fraudulent activity may include double billing schemes, 
    kickbacks, billing for unnecessary or unperformed tests, or may be related 
    to the quality of care provided to patients. In addition to monetary losses, 
    in some instances these improper activities endanger patient safety. United 
    States Attorneys' offices (USAOs) are responsible for civilly and criminally 
    prosecuting health care professionals, providers, and other specialized business 
    entities who engage in health care fraud and abuse. 
  <P>USAOs continue to strengthen cooperative efforts with federal, state and 
    local law enforcement agencies involved in the prevention, evaluation, detection, 
    and investigation of health care fraud and abuse. In addition to the FBI, 
    HHS/OIG and HCFA, USAOs offices work with State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, 
    Offices of Inspectors General for a number of federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement 
    Administration, and the DCIS and TRICARE Support Office. Each USAO has appointed 
    both a civil and criminal health care fraud coordinator to assist in coordination 
    and facilitate communication between federal, state and local law enforcement 
    groups. In addition, many cases are investigated in a parallel fashion, so 
    that potential criminal and civil remedies are addressed more efficiently, 
    by the attorneys and the agencies investigating the wrongdoing. The criminal 
    and civil judgments and settlements with the worlds largest provider of kidney 
    dialysis products and services and the nations largest operator of nursing 
    homes discussed in the program accomplishments above were among the many significant 
    accomplishments of the USAOs and are examples of such parallel investigations 
    and prosecutions. 
  <P>Prior to the enactment of HIPAA, USAOs dedicated substantial resources to 
    combating health care fraud and abuse. HIPAA allocations have supplemented 
    these efforts.

  <P>The Executive Office for the United States Attorneys' Office of Legal Education

    conducted a number of courses and presentations on health care fraud, including: 
  <UL>
    <P> 
    <LI>Civil Health Care Fraud for Attorneys 
    <LI>Criminal Health Care Fraud for Attorneys 
    <LI>Health Care Fraud Seminar for Attorneys – Criminal and Civil 
    <LI>Affirmative Civil Enforcement for attorneys (includes a health care fraud 
      component) 
    <LI>Affirmative Civil Enforcement for auditors and investigators (includes 
      a health care fraud component) </LI>
  </UL>
  <P>While the primary participants in OLE sponsored courses were DOJ employees, 
    agency counsel and investigative personnel were also invited to participate 
    as presenters and students. In addition to OLE sponsored training a number 
    of USAO attorneys, auditors and investigators participated in multi-agency 
    health care fraud training courses over the last year. 
  <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Criminal Prosecutions</STRONG> 
  <P>The primary objective of criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the integrity 
    of our nation's health care programs and to punish and deter those who, through 
    their improper activities, adversely affect the health care system and the 
    taxpayers. 
  <P>Each time a criminal case is referred to a USAO from the FBI, HHS/OIG, or 
    other law enforcement agency, it is opened as a matter pending in the district. 
    A referral remains a matter until an indictment or information is filed or 
    the case is declined for prosecution. In 2000, the USAOs had 1,939 criminal 
    matters pending involving 3,049 defendants, a 2.7 percent decrease in the 
    number of criminal matters over 1999. During 2000, 457 cases were filed involving 
    668 defendants. This represents a 23 percent increase over cases filed in 
    1999. A total of 467 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related 
    crimes in 2000. Health care fraud convictions include both guilty pleas and 
    guilty verdicts. 
  <P>In Ohio, a DME company owner was sentenced for conspiracy to commit mail 
    fraud and money laundering to 70 months imprisonment, payment of $15.1 million 
    in restitution, and 3 years supervised release. The owner pled guilty to charges 
    of defrauding Medicare through a multimillion dollar fraud scheme in which 
    he billed the program for urinary incontinence supplies not provided. In actuality, 
    he provided diapers, bed pads and other supplies not covered by Medicare. 
    Additionally, a jury convicted the DME company's former vice-president of 
    corporate affiliates for her participation in this scheme. She also utilized 
    improper billing codes for non-covered diapers and skin care supplies. To 
    hide the scheme from Medicare, she altered certificates of medical necessity, 
    billing codes, amounts billed and supplies provided. She was sentenced to 
    10 years imprisonment, 3 years probation and payment of restitution, including 
    payment of $135,047 to a private insurance company affected by the scheme. 
  <P>In New York, four individuals were convicted on charges of participating 
    in a scheme involving false billing for health care services for senior citizens 
    to defraud the Medicare program. After a 6-week jury trial, the four defendants 
    were found guilty of conspiracy and receiving kickbacks in exchange for referring 
    lab tests billed to Medicare. The four were also convicted of numerous substantive 
    charges of health care fraud, submitting false statements in connection with 
    the delivery and payment of Medicare benefits, and fraudulently seeking Medicare 
    payments based on false claims for physicians' services. The four defendants 
    ran a program that claimed to provide valuable home-care medical services 
    to senior citizens enrolled in the Medicare program. Senior citizens in urban 
    areas of New York and New Jersey were contacted by telemarketers working for 
    the defendants' company who set up appointments for the senior citizens to 
    be visited in their homes. Unlicenced graduates of foreign medical schools 
    then visited the Medicare beneficiaries, performed a few simple, non-invasive 
    tests, and obtained a rudimentary physical history, along with the senior 
    citizens' Medicare beneficiary numbers. According to the trial evidence, after 
    these visits, practicing physicians and the defendants used Medicare-issued 
    provider numbers to submit more than $12 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare 
    for thousands of cardiac and vascular procedures and lab tests on urine specimens. 
  <P>In Indiana, a chiropractor, was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment, followed 
    by 3 years' supervised release, and ordered to pay $1,000,000 restitution 
    for filing false claims with the Medicaid Program. The defendant owned and 
    operated two chiropractic clinics. He employed marketeers to canvass the areas 
    around his clinics to seek out Medicaid-eligible children ages 16 and younger 
    who would then be brought to his clinics for various treatments. The defendant 
    instructed his staff to perform Temperature Gradient Studies on every child 
    who came to the clinics, even though these studies were not typically necessary, 
    and were neither viewed nor used by the attending chiropractor prior to or 
    during treatment of the young patients. 
  <P>In Delaware, a doctor specializing in pain management services was convicted 
    of health care fraud, mail fraud and money laundering and sentenced to six 
    and one half years in jail for scheming to defraud insurance companies of 
    over $2 million. The doctor was convicted of submitting bills for pain management 
    services that she did not perform. Instead, the doctor copied test results 
    from one patient to another and submitted falsified tests to insurance companies 
    in support of her claims for payment. In many cases the test results from 
    one patient were "cut and pasted," so that one patient's name was taped over 
    the name of another. In other cases, the name of one patient was removed with 
    white out, and used to the support claims for services claimed to be provided 
    to other patients. In over 100 cases, test results between two patients matched 
    identically, which according to expert testimony, is a physical impossibility. 
    The money laundering conviction involved the doctor's efforts to conceal the 
    proceeds of the health care fraud by engaging in convoluted financial transactions 
    to send the money overseas. 
  <P>A former State Senator was sentenced to serve five years in prison, and to 
    pay $98,175 in restitution and $50,000 in fines, for conspiring to defraud 
    Medicare. The conspiracy involved more than five additional actors, with the 
    State Senator as the organizer/leader. The state senator was the unofficial 
    owner of two home health nursing companies through which the conspirators 
    billed false claims. 
  <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Civil Cases</STRONG> 
  <P>Civil health care fraud efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative Civil 
    Enforcement (ACE) activities. The ACE Program helps ensure that federal laws 
    are obeyed and that violators provide compensation to the government for losses 
    and damages they cause. Civil health care fraud matters ordinarily involve 
    the United States utilizing the False Claims Act, as well as common law fraud 
    remedies, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment and conversion to recover 
    damages from those who have submitted false or improper claims to the United 
    States. 
  <P>Each time a civil referral is made to a USAO it is opened as a matter pending 
    in the district. Civil health care fraud matters are referred directly from 
    federal or state investigative agencies, or result from filings by private 
    persons known as "relators," who file suits on behalf of the Federal Government 
    under the 1986 qui tam amendments to the False Claims Act. Relators may be 
    entitled to share in the recoveries resulting from these lawsuits. At the 
    end of 2000, the USAOs had 1,995 civil health care fraud matters pending. 
    A matter becomes a case when the United States files a civil complaint, or 
    intervenes in a qui tam action, in United States District Court. The vast 
    majority of civil health care fraud cases and matters are settled without 
    a complaint ever being filed. In 2000, 233 civil health care fraud cases were 
    filed. 
  <P>In Maryland, a life insurance company agreed to pay the United States approximately 
    $9 million to resolve civil claims, brought to the government's attention 
    principally under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. The complaint 
    alleged that the company submitted false cost reports to the HCFA. The settlement 
    resolved allegations that: (1) for the 1990-1997 fiscal years, the company 
    double-counted paper costs that were incurred in printing Explanation of Medicare 
    Benefit forms and Medicare checks; (2) knowingly charged HCFA for unallowable 
    overhead costs; (3) knowingly charged for costs it did not incur, or which 
    were overstated; and (4) failed to disclose the overcharges to the Office 
    of Audit Services of the HHS-OIG during a 1995 audit. As part of the settlement, 
    the company also agreed to enter into a comprehensive Corporate Integrity 
    Agreement with the HHS/OIG. 
  <P>In Louisiana, a health center agreed to pay the United States approximately 
    $1.5 million for submitting false claims under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
    Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the health center admitted that it submitted 
    false claims for anesthetic services provided by a doctor which were never 
    performed. and also admitted that it submitted false claims for anesthesia 
    services by the same doctor when it knew he did not meet the licensure requirements 
    to be a physician in the state. The health center agreed to implement a Corporate 
    Integrity Program to prevent fraud, abuse, and false billings to Medicare, 
    Medicaid and all other federal health care programs.

      Civil Division 
    </CENTER>
    </STRONG></FONT> 
  <P>Civil Division attorneys vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care 
    fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors General 
    of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, 
    the HCFA, and other federal and state law enforcement agencies. Cases involve 
    providers of health care services, supplies and equipment, as well as carriers 
    and fiscal intermediaries, that defraud Medicare, Medicaid, the TRICARE program 
    of the Department of Defense, the FEHBP, and other government health care 
    programs. 
  <P><STRONG>Accomplishments</STRONG> 
  <P>In 2000, a total of 128 health care fraud cases or matters were filed or 
    opened. In addition to these new efforts, the Civil Division pursued over 
    400 existing cases. A significant number of the Division's health care fraud 
    cases have the potential for particularly high damages. Civil Division attorneys 
    were actively involved in the successful recoveries described in the overview. 
    The following discussion demonstrates the breadth and significance of other 
    cases in which the Division was involved during 2000. 
  <P><B>Lab Tests:</B> In culmination of an investigation begun in early 1997, 
    a dialysis services company based in Sweden, and two of its Florida subsidiaries, 
    agreed to pay the Government more than $53 million to settle allegations of 
    submitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE for end stage renal 
    disease (ESRD) laboratory services. The laboratories allegedly billed Medicare 
    for medically unnecessary lab tests; double billed for lab tests included 
    in ESRD composite rate payments; and violated the 50 percent rule, which specifies 
    that if 50 percent or more of the laboratory tests performed as a profile 
    of tests are included in the composite rate, then the entire profile is considered 
    to be included in the composite rate. As part of the settlement agreement, 
    the company entered into a 5-year comprehensive corporate integrity agreement 
    targeting ESRD lab billing risk areas and covering any and all ESRD labs owned 
    or operated by the company. 
  <P><B>Upcoding:</B> One of the largest operators of hospitals in rural areas 
    and small cities agreed to pay the Government $31.8 million for allegedly 
    submitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE, and to adhere to 
    a corporate integrity agreement. The nationwide settlement resolved allegations 
    of upcoding diagnostic codes through which the company received increased 
    reimbursement amounts at 36 of its hospitals. The investigation revealed that 
    the company initiated an aggressive coding procedure referred to as the optimization 
    program. The program encouraged the chain's hospitals to meet very high, and 
    often unrealistic, coding volume goals, which led to excessive rates of reimbursement 
    by Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. The investigation further determined that 
    the inappropriate coding occurred based on improper guidance and instruction 
    provided by officials from the company's headquarters in Tennessee. 
  <P>More than 70 entities that provided, or assisted in the provision of, radiation 
    oncology services to cancer patients, as well as their billing companies, 
    agreed to pay almost $10 million to settle allegations of false claims to 
    federally-funded health care programs. The settlement also resolved claims 
    that the defendants fraudulently transferred assets to avoid repaying the 
    United States. During 2000, the United States recovered $2.6 million from 
    the clients of an Oklahoma-based physician billing service to settle claims 
    of overpayments based on false claims submitted by the company. These settlements 
    follow on the heels of a September 1999 settlement with the same company and 
    its physician founder for $15 million for fraudulent billing to Medicare, 
    Medicaid, TRICARE, and the FEHBP. Including settlements in prior years, recoveries 
    from this one Oklahoma-based company's clients themselves top $13 million; 
    the United States continues to pursue other clients of the company. 
  <P>In addition to these case-specific accomplishments, the Department's Nursing 
    Home Initiative, coordinated by the Civil Division, promotes increased prosecution 
    and coordination at federal, state and local levels to fight the abuse, neglect, 
    and financial exploitation of the nation's senior and infirm population. The 
    financial crisis in the nursing home industry has to date resulted in bankruptcy 
    filings by five of the seven largest nursing home chains and several smaller 
    chains. These bankruptcy cases are the largest ever involving health care 
    providers, and raise the specter of failure of care as well financial issues, 
    thus requiring significant on-going coordination between the Civil Division's 
    Corporate Finance and Civil Fraud sections, the Criminal Division, HCFA, and 
    HHS/OIG. 
  <P>Also, the Civil Division continues to chair the Managed Care Fraud Working 
    Group, which meets quarterly and coordinates the managed care enforcement 
    activities of all concerned federal and state agencies. 
  <P>Vital resources were made available from the Account to provide the Civil 
    Division with Automated Litigation Support (ALS), auditors, and consultants. 
    These resources supplemented other Civil Division funds. During 2000, ALS 
    was provided to 8 cases while auditor/consultant support was provided to 26 
    cases, included in those cases receiving support was the Department's tobacco 
    litigation. Four of the supported cases have settled, yielding $584 million. 
    Recoveries in the remaining cases are projected to reach hundreds of millions 
    of dollars.

  <P>Successful health care fraud enforcement cannot be achieved by any one agency 
    alone. Investigations must be a cooperative effort if they are to be successful 
    in combating the increasing problem of health care fraud. The FBI is involved 
    in this cooperative effort. The FBI works many health care fraud cases on 
    a joint basis with other federal agencies, including the HHS/OIG. These two 
    federal agencies collaborate through attendance at health care fraud working 
    groups, attend each other's training conferences, and have a liaison program 
    between the two organizations. In addition, the Health Care Fraud task forces 
    represent the coordinated efforts of the FBI, state and local law enforcement, 
    investigative agencies such as Inspectors General, and private industry. The 
    FBI and HHS/OIG continue to share a common commitment to ending fragmented 
    health care fraud enforcement efforts and encouraging the coordination of 
    investigative resources. 
  <P>In addition to providing new statutory tools to combat health care fraud, 
    HIPAA specified mandatory funding to the FBI for health care fraud enforcement. 
    In 2000, $76 million was provided by HIPAA for 651 positions (380 agents). 
    The FBI used this funding, in large part, to fund an additional 35 agents 
    and 77 support positions for health care fraud and to create several new dedicated 
    Health Care Fraud Squads. This increase in personnel resources along with 
    the direct FBI funding increased the number of FBI agents addressing health 
    care fraud in the fourth quarter of 2000 to approximately 520 agents as compared 
    to 112 in 1992. 
  <P>As the FBI has increased the number of Agents assigned to health care fraud 
    investigations, the caseload has increased dramatically from 591 cases in 
    1992, to 2,980 cases through 2000. The FBI caseload is divided between those 
    health plans receiving government funds and those that are privately funded. 
    Criminal health care fraud convictions resulting from FBI investigations have 
    risen from 116 in 1992, to 550 in 2000. 
  <P>Health care fraud investigations are among those investigations having the 
    highest priority within the FBI. The investigations are generally complex 
    and require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully investigate. 
    Often sophisticated, innovative and creative ideas are needed to combat and 
    eventually prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes. As the complexity and 
    long-term nature of health care fraud investigations increase, the FBI anticipates 
    that the number of FBI investigations and convictions will begin to level 
    off. 
  <P>A considerable portion of the increased funding was utilized to support major 
    health care fraud investigations. In addition, operational support has been 
    provided for FBI national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical diversion, 
    chiropractic fraud, and medical clinics. Further, the Health Care Fraud Unit, 
    FBI Headquarters, supported individual field offices with equipment and supplies 
    to assist in numerous individual investigations. 
  <P>The funding made available through HIPAA also made possible two Basic Health 
    Care Fraud training conferences which provided the expertise necessary for 
    FBI Agents assigned to health care fraud investigations. Around 300 Agents 
    received specialized training on the fraud schemes plaguing a particular provider 
    service that has been historically vulnerable to fraud. The HIPAA funding 
    also allowed FBI headquarters staff to conduct specialized training sessions 
    in a number of FBI field offices and to make numerous presentations to various 
    industry groups.
