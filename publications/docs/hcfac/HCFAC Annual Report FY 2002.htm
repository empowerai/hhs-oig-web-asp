	<h1 align="center"><a name="1"></a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
	<hr width="70%">
	<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
		established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC 
		or the Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney General and 
		the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, 
		acting through the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed 
		to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement activities with 
		respect to health care fraud and abuse. In its sixth year of operation, 
		the Program's continued success again confirmed the soundness of a collaborative 
		approach to identify and prosecute the most egregious instances of health 
		care fraud, to prevent future fraud or abuse, and to protect program beneficiaries.</p>
	<p><b>Monetary Results</b></p>
	<p>In 2002, the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.8 billion 
		in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care 
		fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well 
		as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, 
		the Federal government collected over $1.6 billion, of which approximately 
		$1.4 billion was returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional $59 
		million was recovered as the federal share of Medicaid restitution. This 
		is the largest return to the government since the inception of the Program<b>. 
		</b></p>
	<p><b>Enforcement Actions</b></p>
	<p>Federal prosecutors filed 361 criminal indictments in health care fraud 
		cases in 2002. A total of 480 defendants were convicted for health care 
		fraud-related crimes during the year. There were also 1,529 civil matters 
		pending, and 221 civil cases filed in 2002. HHS excluded 3,448 individuals 
		and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, 
		or other federally sponsored health care programs, most as a result of 
		convictions for crimes relating to Medicare or Medicaid, for patient abuse 
		or neglect, or as a result of licensure revocations. </p>

	<p> 
	<center>
		<h2><b><u>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</u></b> </h2>
	</center>
	<p></p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The Social Security Act section 1128C(a), as established by the Health 
		Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA 
		or the Act), created the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, 
		a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse in health care, including 
		both public and private health plans. </p>
	<p>The Act requires that an amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations 
		-- including criminal fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, 
		and administrative penalties, but excluding restitution, compensation 
		to the victim agency, and relators' shares -- be deposited in the Medicare 
		Trust Fund.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> All funds deposited in the 
		Trust Fund as a result of the Act are available for the operations of 
		the Trust Fund. </p>
	<p>As stated above, the Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund 
		to an expenditure account, called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control 
		Account (the Account), in amounts that the Secretary and Attorney General 
		jointly certify as necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. The maximum 
		amounts available for certification are specified in the Act. Certain 
		of these sums are to be used only for activities of HHS/OIG, with respect 
		to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2002, the Secretary and the Attorney 
		General certified $209 million for appropriation to the Account. A detailed 
		breakdown of the allocation of these funds is set forth later in this 
		report. These resources generally supplement the direct appropriations 
		of HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) that are devoted to health 
		care fraud enforcement, though they provide the sole source of funding 
		for Medicare and Medicaid enforcement by HHS/OIG. (Separately, the Federal 
		Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received $101 million from HIPAA which is 
		discussed in the Appendix.)</p>
	<p>Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the 
		Program's goals are: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating 
			to health care fraud and abuse;<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li> to conduct investigations, audits and evaluations relating to the 
			delivery of and payment for health care in the United States;<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li> to facilitate enforcement of all applicable remedies for such fraud;<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li> to provide guidance to the health care industry regarding fraudulent 
			practices; and<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li> to establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse 
			actions against health care providers.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit a joint 
		annual report to the Congress which identifies both:</p>
	<ol>
		<li> the amounts appropriated to the Trust Fund for the previous fiscal 
			year under various categories and the source of such amounts; and<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>the amounts appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use 
			by the Attorney General and the Secretary and the justification for 
			the expenditure of such amounts.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This annual report fulfills the above statutory requirements. </p>
	<p> 
	<hr width="70%">
	<h1 align="center"><a name="3"></a>MONETARY RESULTS</h1>
	<hr width="70%">
	<p>As required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the 
		amounts deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the 
		source of such deposits. In 2002, as a result of the combined anti-fraud 
		actions of the Federal and state governments and others, the Federal government 
		collected a record high of more than $1.6 billion in connection with health 
		care fraud cases and matters.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> These 
		funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and the Centers 
		for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), transferred to other Federal 
		agencies administering health care programs, or paid to private persons.

	<h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
	<p><b><u>Collections</u></b></p>
	<p>During this year, the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.8 
		billion in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health 
		care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as 
		well as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, 
		the Federal government collected $1.6 billion in cases resulting from 
		health care fraud and abuse, of which approximately $1.4 billion was returned 
		to the Medicare Trust Fund, and $59 million was recovered as the Federal 
		share of Medicaid restitution. It should be emphasized that some of the 
		judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in 2002 will result 
		in collections in future years, just as some of the collections in 2002 
		are attributable to actions from prior years. </p>
	<p><b><u>Judgments/Settlements </u></b></p>
	<p> 
		<center>
		</center>
	</p>
	<p>Working together, HHS, DOJ and their partners have brought to successful 
		conclusion the investigation and prosecution of numerous health care fraud 
		schemes. Among them are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP),</b> a major pharmaceutical 
			manufacturer, agreed to pay $875,000,000 to resolve criminal charges 
			and civil liabilities in connection with its fraudulent pricing and 
			marketing of the cancer drug, Lupron. Under the global agreement, 
			TAP agreed to plead guilty to a conspiracy to violate the Prescription 
			Drug Marketing Act and to pay a $290,000,000 criminal fine. To resolve 
			its civil liability under the FCA, TAP agreed to pay the United States 
			$559,483,560 for filing fraudulent claims with Medicare and Medicaid, 
			and to pay the fifty states and the District of Columbia $25,516,440 
			for filing fraudulent claims with the states. Additionally, TAP entered 
			a sweeping corporate integrity agreement which significantly changes 
			the manner in which TAP supervises its marketing and sales staffs, 
			and ensures that TAP will report to the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
			the true average sale price for drugs reimbursed by those programs. 
		</li>
		<p> While Medicare does not pay for most drugs, Medicare does cover those, 
			such as Lupron, that must be injected under the supervision of a physician. 
			Medicare paid for 80 percent of either the urologist's charge for 
			Lupron or the average wholesale price (AWP) reported by TAP, whichever 
			was lower. The government alleged that TAP set and controlled the 
			price at which the Medicare program reimbursed physicians for the 
			prescription of Lupron by misreporting its AWP as significantly higher 
			than the average sales price TAP offered physicians and other customers 
			for the drug. TAP allegedly "marketed the spread" between its discounted 
			prices paid by physicians and the significantly higher Medicare reimbursement 
			based on AWP as an inducement to physicians to obtain their Lupron 
			business. The government further alleged that TAP concealed the true 
			discounted prices paid by physicians from Medicare, and falsely advised 
			physicians to report the higher AWP rather than their real discounted 
			price for the drug. </p>
		<p> The investigation, prosecution and settlement reflect a collaborative 
			effort among the United States Attorneys Office Massachusetts, the 
			DOJ, the FBI, the HHS/OIG, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
			Office of Criminal Investigations and the Department of Defense, Defense 
			Criminal Investigation Service (DCIS).</p>
		<li><b>Federal Employees Health Benefits</b>. PacifiCare Health Systems 
			agreed to pay the United States $87.3 million to settle allegations 
			that it and its predecessor companies violated the FCA with respect 
			to claims submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This 
			represents the largest civil settlement involving the Federal Employees 
			Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Based on an investigation by the 
			OPM Office of Inspector General, the government alleged that PacifiCare's 
			subsidiaries failed to follow applicable rules when developing the 
			rates it charged for health care benefits under its FEHBP contracts, 
			including failing to give the health care program the same discounted 
			rates the company gave its similarly situated commercial customers, 
			failing to coordinate FEHBP benefits with those provided to Medicare 
			eligible annuitants; and submitting statements to OPM that failed 
			to fully disclose rate adjustments due to FEHBP. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Medicaid Eligibility</b>. The State of California and the County 
			of Los Angeles agreed to pay $73.3 million to resolve their civil 
			liability under the FCA and Civil Monetary Penalties Law for submitting 
			claims for services provided to minors who were not Medicaid eligible. 
			The settlement resolves allegations that the State and the County 
			billed the Federal health care program for services provided to minors 
			when these jurisdictions had no basis for concluding that these individuals 
			financially qualified for Medicaid services. The services at issue 
			in this matter involve treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, pregnancy 
			and pregnancy related services, family planning, sexual assault treatment, 
			sexually transmitted diseases and mental health services. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Medicare contractor cases: <br>
			<br>
			</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li> <u>General American Life Insurance Company, Inc.</u> (General 
				American) agreed to pay $76 million to settle allegations of misconduct 
				occurring when the company served as a Medicare Part B carrier. 
				General American allegedly failed to process claims properly, 
				then submitted false information to CMS regarding the accuracy 
				of and the timeliness with which it handled those claims. The 
				company also allegedly breached its contract by failing to report 
				errors identified in the quality assuranceprocess; and concealing 
				its true error rate by deleting claims selected for review by 
				CMS and replacing them with claim files that would not significantly 
				affect their error rate (and so preserve their standing within 
				carrier performance rankings). Additionally, General American 
				allegedly hid documents, altered others and falsified numerous 
				reports. No corporate integrity agreement was entered since General 
				American has ceased to be a carrier. <br>
				<br>
				In a separate proceeding, General American's former Medicare Director 
				was sentenced to 27 months in prison for conspiracy to falsify 
				and conceal information from Federal auditors. <br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li><u>Florida Medical Quality Assurance, Inc. (FMQAI</u>) and its 
				parent company, Alabama Quality Assurance Foundation (AQAF) agreed 
				to pay $838,832 to resolve allegations that FMQAI submitted false 
				claims for reimbursement to Medicare. The two firms are peer review 
				organizations that perform services under direct contracts with 
				the CMS. The settlement resulted from a government investigation 
				following a self-disclosure that revealed the improper charging 
				to FMQAI's Medicare contract of time and expenses actually spent 
				on FMQAI's Medicaid contract with a state agency in Florida. A 
				<em>qui tam</em> complaint was also filed in the case.<br>
				<br>

		</ul>
		<li><b>Ambulance Services. </b>American Medical Response, Inc. (AMR), 
			the nation's largest ambulance service provider, agreed to pay $20 
			million to resolve its civil and administrative liability for false 
			claims submitted to Medicare. The <em>qui tam</em> action involved 
			allegations that AMR's Massachusetts subsidiary and certain of its 
			predecessor companies had billed for medically unnecessary services, 
			falsified certificates of medical necessity and engaged in other improper 
			billing practices. As part of the settlement, AMR entered into a 3-year 
			corporate integrity agreement with HHS/OIG. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Hospital Contractor.</b> KPMD, LLP (KPMG, formerly KPMG Peat Marwick, 
			LLP), agreed to pay $9 million, plus interest, to the Federal government 
			to resolve allegations of submitting false hospital cost reports to 
			the Medicare and Medicaid programs on behalf of clients Basic American 
			Medical, Inc. and Columbia Hospital Corporation. The government alleged 
			that KPMG knowingly made claims that were false, exaggerated or ineligible 
			for payment, and concealed errors from government auditors, thereby 
			permitting the client hospitals to retain funds to which they were 
			not entitled. KPMG also prepared "reserve" cost reports detailing 
			non-allowable expenses and allocations contained in the filed cost 
			reports and estimated the reimbursement impact in the event that these 
			non-allowable expenses and allocations were detected on audit. <br>

	<p>These and other settlements reflect the culmination of investigations that 
		have been ongoing for several years. </p>
	<p><b><u>Quality of Care</u></b></p>
	<p>One area in which collaboration has proved most effective has been in enforcement 
		and oversight of issues relating to quality of care, as demonstrated by 
		the following: </p>
	<p><b>Enforcement Actions. </b>Several important enforcement actions culminated 
		in 2002:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In Missouri, as the result of a joint investigation by the FBI and 
			the FDA, a pharmacist diluted drugs that had been prescribed as treatment 
			for cancer patients. He pleaded guilty to 8 counts of consumer product 
			tampering, 6 counts of drug adulteration, and 6 counts of drug misbranding, 
			and was sentenced to a term of 30 years imprisonment. The 30 year 
			prison term represented an upward departure from the guideline sentencing 
			range and was the maximum sentence available under the plea agreement. 
			The pharmacist and his corporation also were ordered to pay a fine 
			of $25,000 and victim restitution of $10.5 million, which will be 
			distributed using assets seized during the government's civil prosecution.</li>
		<p> On the civil side, the Court entered a consent decree banning the 
			pharmacist until further order of the Court from practicing pharmacy, 
			possessing pharmacy licenses, or violating any provision of the Food, 
			Drug, &amp; Cosmetic Act. The assets previously frozen in the civil 
			case were transferred to the criminal case for use as restitution 
			by victims. The pharmacist confessed to diluting in excess of 60 different 
			drugs beginning in 1992 until his arrest in August of 2001. All of 
			the drugs that may have been diluted were administered intravenously 
			or through injection. The pharmacist's actions affected approximately 
			400 physicians, 4,200 patients, and 98,000 prescriptions. <br>
			<br>
		<li>A California physician and clinic owner/operator was convicted of 
			multiple felony counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, bankruptcy 
			fraud and making false statements. The physician deliberately misdiagnosed 
			patients as suffering from a rare vascular disease that requires patients 
			to obtain expensive pumps, braces and other medical devices. The physician 
			was also convicted of making false statements when he filed for bankruptcy 
			in 1996. The physician was sentenced to 5 years in prison and ordered 
			to pay $2.87 million in restitution.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>An Indiana man was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to 
			pay $1.9 million in restitution to persons who suffered injury as 
			a result of his role in a conspiracy to defraud insurance carriers 
			and cancer patients. The man worked as the business manager for a 
			practitioner and operator of a medical center. The two aggressively 
			marketed treatments not approved by FDA to terminally ill cancer patients. 
			The individual falsely billed these treatments as if the patients 
			received chemotherapy, and created and submitted false documents to 
			insurance companies to support the billings. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>As the result of a joint investigation by HHS/OIG and the Maryland 
			Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU), a registered nurse and owner of 
			a dialysis clinic was sentenced to 5 years in jail, with all but 18 
			months suspended, and ordered to pay $100,000 in restitution for Medicaid 
			fraud and reckless endangerment. In addition, his clinic was fined 
			$300,000 for Medicaid fraud. For more than two years, the nurse failed 
			to administer epogen, a synthetic hormone typically administered during 
			dialysis, and falsified epogen administration flow sheets. <br>
			<br>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Nursing Facility Quality of Care - OIG Symposium.</b> The HHS/OIG hosted 
		a symposium entitled, "Nursing Facility Quality of Care: Improving Government 
		Enforcement Efforts." The symposium sought to enhance the government's 
		enforcement efforts through an analysis of the current methods utilized 
		by the government to pursue quality of care cases in nursing homes. The 
		symposium included a series of case studies presented by attorneys and 
		investigators who had successfully conducted quality of care cases. The 
		meeting drew participants from CMS, DOJ, United States Attorneys' Offices 
		(USAOs), MFCUs, state survey officials, and the HHS/OIG. </p>
	<p><b>Recommendations to Improve Quality of Care</b>. The HHS/OIG issued several 
		significant reports assessing a variety of facets of the quality of care 
		provided to program beneficiaries. These included:&nbsp; </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Psychotropic Drug Use in Nursing Homes.</b> In response to concerns 
			expressed by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, HHS/OIG conducted 
			an evaluation on the use of psychotropic drugs as inappropriate chemical 
			restraints in nursing homes. The study found that this is not a pervasive 
			problem. Where there are problems, they are related to inappropriate 
			dosage, chronic use, a lack of documented benefit to the resident, 
			and unnecessary duplicate drug therapy. The report also noted a lack 
			of adequate documentation for residents' psychotropic drug use in 
			some cases. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS consider educating providers 
			to better document the use of these drugs.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li> <b>Oversight of Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs).</b> An OIG inspection 
			assessed how and how well State agencies and accreditors oversee ASCs, 
			and how CMS holds them accountable. ASCs have experienced explosive 
			growth, more than doubling in number from 1990 to 2000. During the 
			same time period, the volume and complexity of procedures performed 
			in ASCs have increased dramatically, from 12,000 to over 101,000 major 
			procedures annually. For these reasons, oversight is more important 
			than ever, but Medicare's system of quality oversight is flawed. Nearly 
			one-third of ASCs have not been recertified for 5 or more years, and 
			CMS has done little to monitor the performance of State agencies and 
			accreditors. The report made recommendations to CMS to strengthen 
			its quality oversight of ASCs. CMS responded positively, but did not 
			fully commit itself to some recommendations, particularly those calling 
			for a minimum survey cycle and a more accessible complaint process. 
			<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Physician's Role in Medicare Home Health 2001.</b> The HHS/OIG 
			released a final inspection report on the physician's role in Medicare 
			home health. Based on interviews with physicians and review of CMS 
			claims data, this study found that physicians are currently playing 
			a key role in initiating, certifying, and monitoring the care for 
			Medicare home health beneficiaries. However, they feel they have limited 
			knowledge of Medicare home health rules and CMS' expectations of them. 
			At present, the availability of reimbursement for their oversight 
			role does not seem to have significant impact on physicians who care 
			for Medicare home health patients. In order to address physician concerns 
			and improve the Medicare home health services, HHS/OIG recommended 
			that CMS establish a working group of their Physician Regulations 
			Issues Team to improve communication and to consider modifying the 
			physician home health oversight role.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
	</ul>
	<p><b><u>Pharmaceuticals</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Enforcement Actions: </b> Prescription drug pricing remains an important 
		area of inquiry for the HCFAC program. A number of investigations, audits 
		and evaluations focused on whether the government is paying reasonable 
		and appropriate amounts for covered prescription drugs. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In Florida,<b><em> </em></b>Eckerd Corporation agreed to pay the government 
			$5.9 million and to enter into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement 
			to resolve the corporation's liability for submitting claims for partially 
			filled prescriptions. A <em>qui tam</em> alleged that between 1986 
			and 2000, the chain pharmacy submitted false claims each time it dispensed 
			only a portion of a prescription to beneficiaries, but billed Medicaid, 
			TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for 
			the full amount of the prescription.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>In Maine, the twenty-first person was sentenced for his role in leading 
			a large-scale OxyContin distribution ring. The man was sentenced to 
			21 years and 10 months in prison and ordered to pay $6,000 in restitution 
			for health care fraud, conspiracy to acquire controlled substances 
			by fraud, and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to 
			distribute controlled substances. In a related Federal case, he was 
			also sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty in a separate 
			jury trial for distribution of a controlled substance resulting in 
			death.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Studies of Medicare and Medicaid Drug Pricing and Payment:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Medicaid Payments for Prescription Drugs</b>: The HHS/OIG found 
			that Medicaid could save significant dollars in reimbursements to 
			pharmacies for brand name and generic prescription drugs. Most states 
			use AWP, minus a percentage discount, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies 
			for drug prescriptions. In 1999, this discount averaged about 10 percent 
			nationally, which HHS/OIG believes is not sufficient to ensure that 
			reasonable prices are paid. Based on pricing information from pharmacies 
			in eight states, HHS/OIG estimated that the nationwide actual acquisition 
			cost averaged about 22 percent for brand name and 66 percent for generic 
			below AWP. HHS/OIG estimated that the Medicaid program could have 
			saved as much as $1.6 billion in 1999 for the top 200 brand and generic 
			drugs if reimbursements had been made suing the lower averages. This 
			savings calculation was limited to ingredient acquisition costs and 
			did not address other costs, such as dispensing fees. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b><u>Hospitals</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Improperly Reported and Paid Discharges: </b>Under Medicare rules, a 
		consolidation of hospitals is considered a change of ownership. After 
		a consolidation, only the surviving hospital would be entitled to Medicare 
		payments because it was the legal owner on the date patients were discharged. 
		The HHS/OIG conducted a review to determine whether hospitals that ceased 
		to exist after consolidation with another hospital improperly submitted 
		claims for prospective payment system discharges. The review revealed 
		that 15 such hospitals were improperly paid $8 million for 1,118 prospective 
		payment system discharges. These claims were submitted and paid because 
		neither the fiscal intermediaries nor the hospitals had a clear understanding 
		of Medicare payment rules on hospital consolidations. The DOJ has reached 
		settlements, and fiscal intermediaries have begun collecting the overpayments. 
	</p>
	<p><b>Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: </b>The Medicare, Medicaid, 
		and State Child Health Insurance Program Benefits Improvement and Protection 
		Act of 2000 increased public hospitals' Medicaid disproportionate share 
		hospital (DSH) reimbursement from 100 percent to 175 percent of uncompensated 
		care costs--a change expected to increase Federal spending by $380 million 
		during FYs 2003 through 2005. Based on recent and ongoing reviews, HHS/OIG 
		has concluded that the reimbursement increase may not be warranted. These 
		studies have shown that DSH payments are not always retained by public 
		hospitals, are often returned to the states for other uses, and are not 
		always calculated correctly. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS seek legislation 
		to at least delay, if not repeal, the implementation of the increase in 
		DSH payments until the need for and use of DSH funds for direct care of 
		uninsured patients can be examined. </p>
	<p>If the new limit is implemented, additional legislative reform is needed 
		to ensure that DSH funds remain at the hospitals to provide care to vulnerable 
		populations. CMS initially concurred, but later said that it would not 
		seek a legislative change.</p>
	<p>Reviews during 2002 found that DSH payments to some hospitals in California 
		and Missouri exceeded the individual hospitals' uncompensated costs, contrary 
		to provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. DSH payments 
		to one hospital exceeded its hospital-specific limit by $38.7 million. 
		In both states, the limits were overstated because the states' calculations 
		were flawed. The HHS/OIG recommended that the states return the overpayments 
		to the Federal government and implement procedures and controls to prevent 
		similar claims.</p>
	<p>A more detailed description of these and other accomplishments of the major 
		Federal participants in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA 
		follows. While information in this report is presented in the context 
		of a single agency, most of these accomplishments reflect the combined 
		efforts of HHS, DOJ and other partners in the anti-fraud efforts. </p>

	<p align="CENTER"> </p>
	<p>Certain of the funds appropriated under HIPAA are, by law, set aside for 
		Medicare and Medicaid activities of HHS/OIG. During the sixth year of 
		the Program, the Act provided that between $140 and $150 million be devoted 
		to these purposes. The Secretary and the Attorney General jointly allotted 
		$145 million to HHS/OIG in 2002, an increase of $15 million over 2001.</p>
	<p>HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 753 prosecutions or settlements in 
		2002, of which 568, or 75 percent, were health care cases. A total of 
		3,448 individuals and entities were also excluded, many as a result of 
		criminal convictions for crimes related to Medicare or Medicaid (670); 
		or to other health care programs (138); for patient abuse or neglect (296); 
		or as a result of licensure revocations (1,720). </p>
	<p>In addition to HHS/OIG's role in bringing about the judgments and settlements 
		described in the Overview of Accomplishments, HHS acted on HHS/OIG recommendations 
		and collected $150.2 million in disallowances of improperly paid health 
		care funds in 2002. HHS/OIG continues to work with CMS to develop and 
		implement recommendations to correct systemic vulnerabilities detected 
		during HHS/OIG evaluations and audits. These corrective actions often 
		result in health care funds not expended (that is, funds put to better 
		use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG initiatives). In 2002, such funds 
		not expended amounted to more than $19.8 billion -- nearly $14.3 billion 
		in Medicare savings, and $5.6 billion in savings to the Medicaid program.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p><b><u>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</u></b></p>
	<p>HIPAA's increased resources have enabled HHS/OIG to broaden its efforts 
		both to detect fraud and abuse, and to prevent it. Prevention initiatives, 
		such as those listed below, inform and assist the health care industry 
		and its patients. Equally important, these prevention activities reduce 
		program losses and enforcement costs. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Industry Guidance: </b>The centerpiece of the HIPAA guidance initiatives 
			is an advisory opinion process through which parties may obtain binding 
			legal guidance as to whether their existing or proposed health care 
			business transactions run afoul of the Federal anti-kickback statute, 
			the civil monetary penalties laws, or the exclusion provisions. During 
			2002, HHS/OIG issued 20 opinions. A total of 86 advisory opinions 
			have been issued since 1997. The advisory opinion process serves to 
			enhance HHS/OIG's understanding of new and emerging health care business 
			arrangements, and informs the development of new safe harbor regulations, 
			fraud alerts, and special advisory bulletins. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Corporate Integrity Agreements, and the Inspector General's Open 
			Letter: </b>Many health care providers that enter agreements with 
			the government in settlement of potential liability for violations 
			of the FCA also agree to adhere to a separate corporate integrity 
			agreement (CIA). Under this agreement, the provider commits to establishing 
			a program or taking other specified steps to ensure its future compliance 
			with Medicare and Medicaid rules. These agreements require a substantial 
			effort by the provider to ensure that the organization is operating 
			in accordance with Federal health care program requirements and the 
			parameters established by the CIA. At the close of 2002, HHS/OIG was 
			monitoring more than 325 CIAs. </li>
		<p><b> </b>On November 20, 2001, the Inspector General issued an "Open 
			Letter to Health Care Providers" in which she announced modifications 
			to CIAs in response to concerns expressed by the provider and enforcement 
			community. The full text of the letter can be found on the Internet 
			at <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/">http://oig.hhs.gov</a> 
			. </p>
		<li><b>Medicare </b><b>Error Rate:</b> The HHS/OIG estimated that improper 
			Medicare benefit payments made during 2001 totaled $12.1 billion, 
			or about 6.3 percent of the $191.8 billion in processed fee-for-service 
			payments reported by CMS. These improper payments, as in past years, 
			reflect a range of conduct, from reimbursement for services provided 
			but inadequately documented, to inadvertent mistakes, to outright 
			fraud and abuse. </li>
		<p> The 2001 estimate of improper payments is almost half the $23.2 billion 
			that was first estimated for 1996. As a rate of error, the current 
			6.3 percent estimate is the lowest to date, less than half the 13.8 
			percent reported for 1996. However, HHS/OIG advised CMS to continue 
			its efforts to ensure that providers maintain adequate documentation 
			supporting billed services, bill only for services that are medically 
			necessary, and properly code claims. </p>
		<li><b>Recommendations for Systemic Improvements: </b> Frequently, investigations, 
			audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or incentives for questionable 
			or fraudulent financial practices in agency programs or administrative 
			processes. As required by the Inspector General Act, HHS/OIG makes 
			recommendations to address these vulnerabilities, and thereby promotes 
			economy and efficiency in HHS programs and operations. Relying on 
			the independent factual information generated by HHS/OIG, agency managers 
			recommend legislative proposals or other corrective actions that, 
			when enacted or implemented, close loopholes and reduce improper payments 
			or conduct. The net savings from these joint efforts toward program 
			improvements can be substantial. Many of the studies described throughout 
			this report offered evidence and ideas supporting proposals for significant 
			cost savings during 2002 and beyond. Examples of these reviews include 
			the following:<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Capped Rental Equipment:</b> Medicare Part B pays for certain 
				pieces of durable medical equipment such as hospital beds, nebulizers, 
				and wheelchairs under the capped rental category. After a certain 
				period of time, beneficiaries are given the option to purchase 
				the equipment. If they opt to do so, Medicare will pay for repairs 
				to the equipment. If the beneficiary continues to rent, Medicare 
				will pay a semiannual sum to cover maintenance and servicing of 
				the equipment; a fee that is paid regardless of whether such services 
				are actually provided. The HHS/OIG tracked payments for more than 
				3,500 pieces of durable medical equipment that were purchased 
				or leased in 1996. This 5-year analysis disclosed that Medicare 
				paid substantially more for maintenance on rented equipment than 
				it did for repairs on purchased equipment. Furthermore, an analysis 
				of supplier documentation found only 9 percent of the capped rental 
				equipment actually received any maintenance and servicing. For 
				these reasons, the OIG recommended that CMS eliminate the semiannual 
				maintenance payment for rental equipment and, instead, pay only 
				for repairs when needed. This would result in approximately $100 
				million being saved each year by Medicare and its beneficiaries. 
				The CMS agreed with the recommendations and will consider a legislative 
				initiative to eliminate the rental option altogether. <br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Delinquent Medicare Debt: </b>Despite CMS' significant progress 
				in managing debt, especially at Medicare contractors, serious 
				problems remain. The HHS/OIG identified an estimated $670 million 
				(absolute value) in misstated and misclassified delinquent Medicare 
				debt in information reported to the Treasury Department. Misstatements 
				included $450 million in reconciliation errors, $68 million in 
				unsupported or unrecorded transactions, and $152 million in classification 
				errors regarding the debt's eligibility for referral to Treasury 
				for collection. Also, CMS did not have an adequate process for 
				pursuing debt using the required demand letters. The CMS agreed 
				with HHS/OIG recommendations for improving supporting documentation, 
				periodic reconciliations, and supervisory review of delinquent 
				debt activities.<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li> <b>Incorrectly Reported Hospital Transfers: </b> Reviews continued 
				to find significant problems with hospital reporting of inpatient 
				prospective payment system (PPS) transfers as discharges. Since 
				1992, the number of incorrectly reported transfers has trended 
				downward but remains high. The HHS/OIG identified over 153,000 
				claims for incorrectly reported transfers from January 1992 through 
				June 2000 with potential overpayments totaling nearly $233 million. 
				Contributing causes include misapplication of the PPS transfer 
				policy by CMS regional offices and fiscal intermediaries, problems 
				with computer system interfaces at hospitals, and breakdowns in 
				communication between hospitals' medical and billing staffs. The 
				HHS/OIG recommended, among other things, that CMS clarify instructions 
				on the PPS transfer policy and initiate collection of the overpayments 
				identified to date. The CMS agreed to collect overpayments for 
				the 4-year period specified in regulations regarding the reopening 
				of Medicare claims.</li>
			<p> Another review found that Medicare paid 1,610 hospitals an additional 
				$6.8 million because the hospitals reported patients as having 
				left against medical advice (called LAMA discharges), when, in 
				actuality, the patients were admitted to another hospital on the 
				same day. This problem occurred primarily because LAMA discharges 
				were not included in the computerized system edits designed to 
				detect same-day discharge and admission to another hospital. CMS 
				generally concurred with recommendations to recover overpayments 
				and develop adequate internal controls and monitoring safeguards 
				to detect and address transfers reported as LAMA discharges. </p>
			<p> 
			<li><b>Deported Beneficiaries:</b> At the request of the Senate Finance 
				Committee, HHS/OIG examined Medicare payments made on behalf of 
				deported beneficiaries. Of an identified 1,072 deported Medicare 
				beneficiaries, 49 had improper payments totaling $837,000 made 
				on their behalf during 1998 and 1999. These payments occurred 
				because CMS did not include deportation information in its main 
				database of Medicare enrollment data for processing payments to 
				fee-for-service or managed care providers. In addition to recommending 
				financial adjustments, HHS/OIG recommended that CMS use the deportation 
				information already in its possession to preclude such improper 
				payments. The CMS generally concurred.</li>
			<p> 
			<li><b>Nail Debridement Services: </b>An HHS/OIG evaluation found 
				that Medicare paid approximately $97 million for inappropriate 
				nail debridement and related services during calendar year 2000. 
				Almost one-fourth (22.7 percent) of the sampled claims did not 
				have adequate medical justification to support Medicare payment. 
				This represented approximately $51.2 million in Medicare payments. 
				In addition, the study showed that more than half (60 percent) 
				of the inappropriately paid nail debridement claims also contained 
				related podiatry services. When a nail debridement payment is 
				determined to be inappropriate, the other podiatry payments for 
				services related to the nail debridement are also inappropriate. 
				Medicare paid $45.6 million for such related services. CMS agreed 
				to require carriers to closely scrutinize payment for nail debridement 
				services through medical reviews and require podiatrists to adequately 
				document the medical need for all nail debridements. <br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Program Exclusions: </b> The HHS/OIG excluded 3,448 individuals 
			and entities from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal 
			health care programs. Such exclusions are a vital way to prevent continued 
			fraud and to protect program beneficiaries. Exclusions included:<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li> A Missouri transportation company owner/operator was excluded 
				for 15 years after he was convicted of submitting or causing the 
				submission of false claims for ambulance services provided to 
				patients. Additionally, he entered into a $325,000 settlement 
				agreement in a parallel civil suit.</li>
			<li>In Colorado, two certified nurse aides (CNAs) were convicted in 
				a time-card fraud scheme that lasted more than a year and resulted 
				in a loss to Medicaid of approximately $63,000. Additionally, 
				one of the CNAs had previously been convicted and had violated 
				his parole. Both were excluded for 10 years.<br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p><b><u>Focus on Quality of Care </u></b></p>
	<p>HHS/OIG investigations, audits and evaluations focus not just on improper 
		billing for health care services, but also the quality of care provided 
		to program beneficiaries. Activities designed to promote or safeguard 
		beneficiary care included: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Enforcement Actions:</b> <b><br>
			<br>
			</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li> National HealthCare Corporation (NHC) and related entities agreed 
				to pay the government $250,000 to resolve a FCA and administrative 
				actions involving quality of care problems. NHC is a publicly 
				traded nationwide nursing home chain with a number of facilities 
				in Missouri, including Joplin. The case stemmed from a complaint 
				survey performed by the Missouri Division of Aging in 1998. The 
				survey cited the Joplin facility for failure to prevent pressure 
				sores, prevent accidents and maintain proper nutrition; these 
				issues were primarily attributed to Joplin's failure to maintain 
				a proper staffing level. As part of the settlement, NHC also agreed 
				to a comprehensive corporate integrity agreement for Joplin. <br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li> In Louisiana, Twin Oaks Nursing Home, Inc. (Twin Oaks), agreed 
				to pay the government $100,000 to resolve allegations of failing 
				to provide appropriate care. Issues included deficiencies in documentation, 
				improper staffing levels, inadequate supplies and deteriorated 
				equipment. Twin Oaks also agreed to enter into a 5-year corporate 
				integrity agreement that includes a quality monitor requirement.</li>
			<p> 
			<li>A licensed practical nurse at a Pennsylvania nursing home was 
				sentenced to 10 months incarceration and lost her nursing license 
				for falsifying a patient's record after a medication error was 
				discovered. The error was a contributing factor in the patient's 
				later death. <br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p><b><u>Other Judgments and Settlements.</u> </b></p>
	<p>In addition to the significant enforcement actions described in the Program 
		Accomplishments section of this report, and those immediately above, HHS/OIG 
		conducted or participated in numerous investigations that resulted in 
		prosecution or settlement during 2002, involving all aspects of the health 
		care industry. These include<b>:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Kickbacks</b>: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the HHS/OIG 
			to impose civil monetary penalties against those who pay or receive 
			remuneration in violation of the anti-kickback statute. During 2002, 
			the HHS/OIG stepped up enforcement efforts under this administrative 
			authority. Among these actions were:<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li> A Tennessee investigation revealed a scheme in which a mobile 
				ultrasound company paid referral fees to physicians, ostensibly 
				in the form of rent, to induce the physicians to refer Medicare 
				beneficiaries for diagnostic testing. The ultrasound company and 
				its owners agreed to pay $225,000 to resolve their civil monetary 
				penalty liability for violations of the anti-kickback statute 
				and the physician self-referral (Stark) law. Under the settlement 
				agreement, the company ceased operations, one owner agreed to 
				a permanent exclusion from participation in Federal health care 
				programs, and the other owner agreed to certify to HHS/OIG concerning 
				her employment and compensation over the next five years. In separate 
				actions, HHS/OIG entered settlement agreements with a physician 
				group and individual physicians for the payment of a total of 
				$117,900 to resolve their civil monetary penalty liability for 
				this arrangement.<br>

			</li>
			<li>A Georgia corporation that provides home infusion services self-disclosed 
				a kickback arrangement involving one of its subsidiaries. The 
				operator of that subsidiary paid illegal fees to a nurse at a 
				local hospital in exchange for the nurse's referring Medicare 
				and Medicaid patients to the subsidiary's home infusion facility. 
				The operator paid the nurse a fixed percent of collected net revenues 
				for referred patients, and disguised those referral fees as sales 
				commissions. When headquarters discovered the kickback arrangement, 
				the operator was terminated, and the location closed. The U.S. 
				Attorney's Office declined to pursue the case under the civil 
				FCA because it determined that the HHS/OIG's civil monetary penalty 
				authority was a more appropriate remedy in this kickback case. 
				The company agreed to pay $130,691 and to implement certain measures 
				to supplement its current compliance program. <br>

		<li>Allina Health System, a large integrated health care organization 
			operating a variety of medically-related facilities and businesses, 
			agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle allegations that it 
			submitted false claims to the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs. 
			The government alleged that Allina's hospitals and clinics violated 
			the FCA by knowingly seeking reimbursement through a variety of improper 
			billing methods, such as duplicate billing and upcoding. The settlement 
			also resolves <em>qui tam</em> claims that Allina knowingly retained 
			overpayments after the company's own audits demonstrated that it had 
			submitted erroneous claims. As part of the settlement, Allina agreed 
			to enter into a comprehensive 5-year corporate integrity agreement 
			covering all of its lines of business. <br>

		</li>
		<li>In one of the longest sentences ever imposed in a Federal health care 
			case, a Texas woman was sentenced to 17.5 years in jail and ordered 
			to pay over $9.3 million in restitution and over $3,000 in special 
			assessments after being convicted on 32 counts of health care fraud. 
			The woman defrauded Medicare, Medicaid and several private insurance 
			companies by billing for services not rendered through multiple clinics 
			she established (some of which were entirely fictitious). The false 
			claims included inpatient hospital visits, physical therapy and chemotherapy. 
			Although first indicted on 17 counts of health care fraud in April 
			2000, the woman continued her false billings and as a result, was 
			indicted on 15 additional counts of health care fraud in May 2001. 
			<br>
			<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Evidence showed that the woman, even after two indictments, still continued 
		to falsely bill health care programs for services not rendered.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Molina Healthcare of California, Inc., doing business as Molina Medical 
			Centers (Molina), a Medicaid managed care plan in California, paid 
			$600,000 to resolve its civil monetary penalty liability for furnishing 
			false and misleading information to Medicaid beneficiaries. Molina 
			sent over 17,000 letters to its Medicaid enrollees stating that if 
			these beneficiaries did not re-enroll with Molina they would lose 
			access to their primary care physicians. Further, these letters appeared 
			as though they were sent directly from the beneficiaries' physicians; 
			in reality, they were sent by a mailing house at the direction of 
			Molina. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>In Florida, four individuals were sentenced to an average length of 
			imprisonment of 11 years and ordered jointly to pay a total of $11.7 
			million in restitution for conspiracy, fraud and money laundering. 
			The four conspired to defraud Medicare and Medicaid by submitting 
			false claims for laboratory tests. To carry out their scheme, the 
			group used confidential Medicare and Medicaid information to prepare 
			laboratory test requisitions for tests not actually performed. Using 
			the requisitions to support the corresponding Medicare and Medicaid 
			claims, the four fraudulently obtained payments from the programs.

	<h2 align="center"><a name="412"></a>Office of the General Counsel </h2>
	<p>The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) was allocated $4.18 million in 
		HCFAC funding for 2002 to supplement OGC's efforts to support the Administration's 
		program integrity activities. These funds were used primarily for litigation 
		activity, both administrative and judicial. </p>
	<p><b>Accomplishments</b>:</p>
	<p><em>Suspensions</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>OGC provided legal advice and review to CMS for more than 90 suspension 
			actions. Based on reliable evidence of fraud, CMS suspended payments 
			involving over $50 million to a Florida medical laboratory. Plaintiff 
			filed a Federal court action that was dismissed and then pursued its 
			administrative remedies, while DOJ initiated a fraud investigation. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Litigation</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>In nursing home enforcement, OGC opened 310 new administrative cases 
			before the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) in 2002. Civil Monetary 
			Penalties (CMPs) against nursing homes totaled $10.893 million resulting 
			from favorable DAB decisions and negotiated settlements. Before the 
			Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals OGC briefed and argued a case in a 
			nursing home's appeal of a DAB decision upholding all deficiencies 
			and a $365,000 CMP.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>DOJ sued a supplier of special mattresses for wound care, seeking 
			to recover $1 million in overpayments on the theories of fraud, unjust 
			enrichment, and mistake of fact. OGC provided litigation support and 
			programmatic advice to DOJ as the Medicare overpayment case proceeded 
			to trial.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Bankruptcies</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>OGC continues to be heavily involved with CMS's bankruptcy workload. 
			OGC protects Medicare funds by asserting CMS's recoupment rights to 
			collect overpayments, by arguing to continue suspension or termination 
			actions against debtors or by seeking adequate assurances from the 
			bankruptcy court that CMS's interests in the debtor's estate will 
			be protected, by arguing for the assumption of the Medicare provider 
			agreement as an executory contract, and by petitioning for administrative 
			costs where appropriate.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>&quot;First Ruling&quot; in <u>Holyoke Nursing Home v. HCFA</u>, the 
			Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts followed the view 
			of the 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit (<u>In re TLC Hosp. Inc.</u>) in holding 
			that Medicare's overpayment recoveries effectuated through payment 
			withholding constituted permissible recoupment (i.e. were neither 
			avoidable preferential transfers prior to filing nor unauthorized 
			offsets in violation of the automatic stay after filing). Medicare 
			payments are part of a single ongoing transaction between a provider 
			and the Program and, as such, are subject to recoupment. 
	</ul>
	<p> </p>
	<p><em>Policy Guidance and Education</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>OGC worked with CMS Central Office on implementing web-based surveyor 
			training, and recommended revisions to the case studies used in long 
			term care surveyors' training. OGC attorneys also provided training 
			directly, making presentations to approximately 175 California surveyors 
			on surveying, documenting, and defending legally sufficient deficiencies, 
			and instructing on legal aspects of surveying, documentation, and 
			effective witness skills through "Basic Long Term Care Surveyor Training" 
			to over 100 surveyors from several states. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>OGC established "practice groups" which identify national issues requiring 
			policy clarifications and the most effective and efficient means of 
			litigating long term care enforcement cases before the DAB.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>OGC provided legal guidance and assistance in drafting regulations 
			involving: home health agencies, provider enrollment, coordination 
			of benefits, and statistical analysis. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2 align="CENTER"><b><a name="413"></a>Administration on Aging</b></h2>
	<p>In 2002, the Administration on Aging (AoA) was allocated $2 million in 
		HCFAC funds to develop and disseminate consumer education information 
		to older Americans, with a particular focus on persons with low health 
		literacy, individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds, persons living 
		in rural areas, and other vulnerable populations. AoA and its nationwide 
		network of agencies supported community education activities designed 
		to assist older Americans and their families to recognize and report potential 
		errors or fraudulent situations in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
	</p>
	<p><b>Accomplishments:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><u>National Technical Assistance Resource Centers</u>: AoA continued 
			to support four national resource centers that provide materials and 
			technical assistance to professionals who serve older Americans in 
			their communities. The purpose of the resource centers is to educate 
			and empower vulnerable and culturally diverse older Americans and 
			their families to take a more active role in monitoring and protecting 
			the benefit integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs; </li>
		<br>
		<br>
		<li><u>National Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Conference</u>: 
			AoA convened a national conference in Washington, D.C., which brought 
			together more than 250 Federal, state, and community partners who 
			are working to protect the benefit integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid 
			programs. The purpose of the conference was to share successful products 
			and practices, strengthen collaboration between Federal, state and 
			local partners, and to work to advance the performance of the complaint 
			referral process, outcome tracking mechanisms, and honor outstanding 
			senior volunteers;<u><br>
			<br>
			</u></li>
		<li><u>Senior Medicare Patrol Projects</u>: AoA provided technical assistance 
			to AoA's 51 Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) projects, located in 45 states 
			plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The purpose of these 
			projects is to recruit and train retired individuals to educate seniors 
			in their communities about how they can help prevent and detect potential 
			Medicare and Medicaid error, fraud, and abuse. In 2002, the projects 
			trained 9,000 senior volunteers who directly educated 485,000 Medicare 
			beneficiaries in their communities on topics such as how to read their 
			Medicare summary notices; <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li><u>Development of Senior Medicare Patrol Website</u>: AoA maintained 
			a website dedicated to providing information about Medicare and Medicaid 
			error, fraud, and abuse targeted to older Americans and community-based 
			professionals who serve aging adults and their families. The site 
			promotes consumer awareness and facilitates the sharing of information 
			and best practices between Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and 
			AoA's grantees and partners. The website also links seniors to information 
			about how to become a volunteer;</li>
	</ul>
	<p> </p>
	<ul>
		<li><u>Community Education Materials</u>: HCFAC funding also supported 
			the design and distribution of health care journals and community 
			education videos in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. A particular 
			emphasis was made to target this information to AoA's nationwide network 
			of aging service professionals; </li>
		through a variety of television, radio, and print media events. While 
		it is not possible to directly track all of the cases reported and dollars 
		recovered through these community education activities, these projects 
		reported nearly $15 million in Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance 
		dollars recouped over the last six months of 2002;

		<h2><b>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</b> </h2>
	</center>
	<p> In 2002, $2.675 million in HCFAC funds was allocated to the CMS to provide 
		Federal grant funding for states to participate in the second year of 
		the Medicaid Payment Accuracy Measurement (PAM) project, which develops 
		payment accuracy measurement methodologies and conducts pilot studies 
		to measure and reduce state Medicaid payment errors.</p>
	<p>Each of the twelve states will pilot test the CMS PAM Model. This model 
		was developed by CMS and The Lewin Group, in collaboration with the nine 
		states that participated during the first year of the project. The CMS 
		PAM Model was designed to explore the feasibility of conducting payment 
		accuracy studies in all states using a single methodology that can produce 
		both state-specific and national level payment accuracy estimates. In 
		addition, the CMS PAM Model has been designed to estimate payment accuracy 
		for both the fee for service and managed care components of the Medicaid 
		program. Of the twelve states, seven states will pilot test the model 
		in fee-for-service, one state will pilot test the model in managed care, 
		and four states will pilot test the model in both fee for service and 
		managed care. </p>
	<p>All states were solicited to participate in the PAM demonstration project 
		under the authority of section 402(a)(1)(j) of the Social Security Act 
		Amendments of 1967.</p>
	<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>In response to the May 2002 all-state solicitation, CMS received applications 
			from twelve states to participate in the PAM project; all twelve states 
			were awarded grants in September 2002. The twelve states are: Florida, 
			Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, 
			North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Notably, eight 
			of these twelve states (Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, 
			North Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming) also participated in 
			the first year of the project. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>CMS and The Lewin Group will be providing technical assistance to 
			the twelve states during the second year of the project to ensure 
			uniform implementation of the CMS PAM Model. Del Marva, a subcontractor 
			to The Lewin Group, will be preparing medical review guidelines and 
			conducting a quality assurance study of the error determination processes 
			in each state to ensure consistency. <br>
			<br>
		<li>The Lewin Group will also be conducting an analysis of the major factors 
			influencing project costs to assist CMS in projecting the future costs 
			of nationwide PAM project implementation.

	<h2 align="CENTER"><b><a name="421"></a>United States Attorneys</b></h2>
	<p>Health care fraud involves a variety of schemes that defraud public insurers, 
		private insurers and health care providers nationwide. In addition to 
		Medicare and Medicaid, a number of federally funded health benefit programs 
		have been the targets of health care fraud schemes. The fraudulent activity 
		may include double billing schemes, kickbacks, billing for unnecessary 
		or unperformed tests, or fraudulent activity may relate to the quality 
		of care provided to patients. In addition to monetary losses, some improper 
		activities endanger patient safety. United States Attorneys' offices (USAOs) 
		are responsible for civil and criminal prosecutions of health care professionals, 
		providers and others. </p>
	<p>USAOs continue to strengthen and refine cooperative efforts with Federal, 
		state and local law enforcement agencies involved in the prevention, evaluation, 
		detection, and investigation of health care fraud and abuse. In addition 
		to the FBI, HHS/OIG and CMS, USAOs work with State MFCUs, State Attorneys 
		General, Offices of Inspectors General for a number of federal agencies, 
		Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FDA, DCIS and TRICARE Support Office. 
	</p>
	<p>Each USAO has appointed both a civil and a criminal health care fraud coordinator 
		to assist in tracking referrals, overseeing investigations and facilitating 
		communication between Federal, state and local law enforcement groups. 
		In addition, many cases are investigated in a parallel fashion, so that 
		the potential criminal and civil remedies are addressed more efficiently, 
		by the attorneys and agencies investigating the wrongdoing. The criminal 
		and civil judgments and settlements discussed in the Program Accomplishments 
		sections of this report provide examples of some significant health care 
		cases in the USAOs, many of which are investigated as parallel investigations 
		and prosecutions. </p>
	<p>Prior to enactment of the HIPAA, USAOs dedicated substantial resources 
		to combating health care fraud and abuse. HIPAA allocations have supplemented 
		those resources by providing dedicated positions for attorneys, paralegals, 
		auditors and investigators. </p>
	<p><b>Training</b></p>
	<p>The Executive Office for the United States Attorneys'/Office of Legal Education 
		(OLE) is responsible for providing health care fraud training for Assistant 
		United States Attorneys (AUSAs) and Department attorneys, paralegals, 
		investigators, and auditors. During 2002, OLE conducted a number of courses 
		and presentations on health care fraud, including: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Health Care Fraud Symposium - Criminal AUSAs, Civil AUSAs and FBI 
			Agents.</li>
		<li>Financial Investigations in Health Care Fraud - Health Care Fraud 
			Paralegals, Investigators and Auditors in USAOs (two week course)</li>
		<li>Affirmative Civil Enforcement (ACE) Issues - Civil AUSAs</li>
		<li>ACE for Auditors and Investigators - HCF Auditors and Investigators 
			(3 day course)</li>
		<li>Special Topics in Health Care Fraud - Criminal and Civil AUSAs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>While the primary participants in OLE-sponsored courses were DOJ employees, 
		agency counsel and investigative personnel were also invited to participate 
		as presenters and students. In addition to OLE-sponsored training, a number 
		of AUSAs, auditors and investigators participated in multi-agency health 
		care fraud programs, as students and as speakers.</p>
	<p><b><u>Program Accomplishments - Criminal Prosecutions</u></b></p>
	<p>The primary objective of criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the 
		integrity of our nation's health care programs and to punish and deter 
		those who, through their improper activities, adversely affect the health 
		care system and the taxpayers.</p>
	<p>Each time a criminal case is accepted for consideration of prosecution 
		in a USAO, it is opened as a matter pending in the district. A referral 
		remains a matter until an indictment or information is filed or the case 
		is declined for prosecution. In 2002, the USAOs had 1,606 health care 
		criminal matters pending, involving 2,441 defendants. </p>
	<p>During 2002, 361 cases were filed involving 608 defendants, a one percent 
		increase over 2001 in the number of defendants. There were 480 health 
		care related convictions in 2002, a three percent increase over 2001. 
		Convictions include both guilty pleas and jury verdicts. A sample of the 
		criminal cases brought by USAOs, in addition to those set forth in the 
		overview section of this report, is set out below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In Alabama, defendants using an Internet website sold prescription 
			drugs, including Viagra, Xenical, Celebrex, Propecia, and Claritin-D, 
			to consumers who did not have valid prescriptions written by a licensed 
			medical practitioner. As part of the scheme, they collected fees for 
			non-existent medical consultations, repackaged drugs obtained from 
			a pharmacy and a drug wholesaler (who was not authorized to provide 
			drugs in Alabama) and shipped the drugs to customers in the United 
			States and around the world. One defendant was sentenced to 188 months 
			and another defendant was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment. They 
			agreed to forfeit $370,000 in assets that had been frozen when the 
			case was indicted. A third defendant, the drug wholesaler and president 
			of the pharmaceutical supply corporation, entered a guilty plea. He 
			was placed on probation for one year, ordered to perform 150 hours 
			of community service, and pay a $1,500 fine. The corporation was ordered 
			to pay a $125,000 fine. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>In Colorado, a chiropractor was convicted by a jury of submitting 
			false Medicare claims for a controversial medical procedure known 
			as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy is a recognized treatment 
			only to reverse the effects of poisoning with heavy metals (such as 
			lead). The treatment is carried out through the administration of 
			an intravenous solution containing a man-made amino acid known as 
			EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid). The defendant operated 
			a clinic which catered to heart disease patients, promising the patients 
			that chelation therapy would reverse or prevent heart disease, hardening 
			of the arteries, diabetes and other generalized vascular conditions. 
			The use of EDTA chelation therapy to treat such conditions is considered 
			experimental and unproven, and Medicare has denied coverage for such 
			treatments since 1982. The chiropractor obtained payments from Medicare 
			by misrepresenting who provided the services, what the services were, 
			and why the patients were being treated. He was sentenced to six years 
			incarceration and restitution to Medicare of $118,000. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>In Kansas, a physician specializing in ear, nose and throat illnesses, 
			performed unnecessary surgeries; billed for services not rendered; 
			billed for more expensive procedures than were actually provided (upcoding); 
			lured patients into unnecessary surgeries that caused them serious 
			bodily injury; and created false documents as well as provided false 
			testimony to cover up his fraud. In 1999, the government's expert 
			witness found that 40 percent of 105 of the defendant's sinus surgeries 
			were unnecessary; and that from 1998-99, all but one of the 40 mastoid 
			ear surgeries the physician performed was unnecessary. Further, the 
			defendant could not have performed the billed surgeries in the extremely 
			short surgery times recorded. He was sentenced to 6 years in jail. 
			No restitution or fine was ordered. The physician lost his license, 
			and agreed to be excluded from Federal health care programs for 15 
			years after release from prison. Restitution was covered by the civil 
			medical malpractice suits filed by the victims.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>In Maine, an investigation of an ambulance service revealed a variety 
			of billing irregularities, including: claims to Medicare for ambulance 
			transportation for patients actually transported in wheelchair vans; 
			claims for more miles than were actually traveled; claims for advanced 
			life support that was never provided; and claims for ambulance transports 
			to hospitals, which is reimbursable, when in fact the patients were 
			transported to doctors' offices, which is not reimbursable. The investigation 
			also revealed altered or false documentation to Medicare and Medicaid 
			auditors during administrative audits. The owner of an ambulance service 
			was sentenced to 49 months in prison for money laundering, obstructing 
			a federal audit, and violating Medicare and Medicaid laws. The fraud 
			totaled $891,492. The ambulance service was placed on probation for 
			5 years. The defendants were ordered to pay $729,875 in restitution. 
			A civil agreement with the United States and the State of Maine was 
			negotiated for additional civil penalties of $300,000. As part of 
			that agreement, the defendants were barred from doing business with 
			Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for 15 years.<b><br>
			<br>
			</b></li>
		<li>In New York, a plastic surgeon was charged with this scheme: (1) an 
			employee of the defendant, who had no medical license and was not 
			acting under a physician's supervision, performed procedures such 
			as lesion removals and cosmetic vein injections, which were billed 
			as though they had been performed by a licensed physician; (2) the 
			defendant's clinic billed cosmetic procedures, such as tummy-tucks 
			and liposuctions, as medically necessary procedures, such as hernia 
			and lesion removals, in order to obtain insurance coverage; (3) the 
			clinic submitted claims to insurance companies for procedures that 
			were never performed; and (4) the clinic exaggerated insurance claims 
			by increasing the number and complexity of procedures actually performed. 
			At sentencing the judge found that the defendant intended to cause 
			approximately $2.5 million in losses to 18 private insurance companies. 
			The judge imposed an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines 
			range, finding that the defendant's obstruction of justice was "widespread 
			and diverse," and included tampering with witnesses, attempting to 
			get other witnesses to lie, falsifying the clinic's medical records, 
			destroying the clinic's records, submitting a false affidavit to the 
			court in connection with a bail hearing and committing "wholesale 
			perjury at trial." The defendant was sentenced to 11 years, 3 months 
			in prison and ordered to pay $918,000 in restitution to the insurance 
			company victims.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>In Texas, a physician electronically filed medical claim forms for 
			150 -180 allergy tests he claimed to have performed when, in fact, 
			he did not have sufficient allergens to perform that number of tests. 
			Also, he prepared phony progress notes regarding the false allergy 
			tests in case Medicaid or Medicare requested supporting documentation 
			when reviewing the claims. The allergy tests were painful and subjected 
			the patient to possible severe reactions, such as abnormal heart rhythms, 
			shortness of breath, severe rashes, swelling, and even death. The 
			doctor had his staff randomly select 13 to 15 patient files per week 
			and create "phantom" billings for dates on which he neither saw nor 
			treated the patients whose insurance he billed. He instructed his 
			staff to create false test results and false documentation, including 
			progress notes, in order to conceal from Medicaid investigators and 
			auditors his fraudulent billing activity and he submitted claims totaling 
			more than $1.3 million to Medicaid for reimbursement on these "phantom" 
			billings. The physician was sentenced to serve five years in prison 
			following a guilty plea to health care fraud and money laundering 
			charges. In addition, he agreed to pay $4 million to the government 
			insurance programs he defrauded, including Medicare, Medicaid, and 
			the FEHBP.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b><u>Program Accomplishments - Civil Cases</u></b></p>
	<p>Civil health care fraud efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative 
		Civil Enforcement (ACE) activities. The ACE Program helps ensure that 
		federal laws are obeyed and that violators provide compensation to the 
		government for losses and damages they cause. Civil health care fraud 
		matters ordinarily involve the United States utilizing the FCA, as well 
		as common law fraud remedies, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment and 
		conversion to recover damages from those who have submitted false or improper 
		claims to the United States. </p>
	<p>Each time a civil referral is made to a USAO it is opened as a matter pending 
		in the district. Civil health care fraud matters are referred directly 
		from federal or state investigative agencies, or result from filings by 
		private persons known as "relators," who file suits on behalf of the Federal 
		Government under the 1986 <em>qui tam</em> amendments to the FCA. Relators 
		may be entitled to share in the recoveries resulting from these lawsuits. 
		At the end of 2002, the USAOs had 1,529 civil health care fraud matters 
		pending. A matter becomes a case when the United States files a civil 
		complaint, or intervenes in a <em>qui tam</em> action, in United States 
		District Court. The vast majority of civil health care fraud cases and 
		matters are settled without a complaint ever being filed. In 2002, 221 
		civil health care fraud cases were filed. </p>
	<p>A sample of the civil cases brought by USAOs, in addition to those in described 
		in the overview section, are set forth below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In California, a health care company and its affiliate agreed to pay 
			$8.5 million to settle allegations that they and 13 of their hospitals 
			knowingly defrauded Medicare and other federal health insurance programs 
			by submitting fraudulent cost reports in order to obtain millions 
			of dollars for costs which were inflated or not allowable. The Government 
			alleged that the defendants kept two sets of books - those shown to 
			the government's auditors and a second "reserve" or "booked" set hidden 
			from the government which identified the unallowable and inflated 
			costs included in the filed cost reports - and that the defendants 
			set aside funds to repay the government in case the unallowable costs 
			were eventually discovered. The United States' complaint also alleged 
			fraudulent submissions made to the Medicaid and TRICARE/CHAMPUS programs.

		<h2><b><a name="422"></a>Civil Division</b> </h2>
	</center>
	<p>Civil Division attorneys vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care 
		fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors 
		General of the HHS and the Department of Defense, CMS, and other federal 
		and state law enforcement agencies. Cases involve providers of health 
		care services, supplies and equipment, as well as carriers and fiscal 
		intermediaries, that defraud Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the FEHBP, and 
		other government health care programs.</p>
	<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>In 2002, the Division opened or filed a total of 74 health care fraud cases 
		or matters. In addition to these new efforts, the Civil Division pursued 
		390 existing cases. A significant number of these health care fraud cases 
		have the potential for particularly high damages. Civil Division attorneys 
		were actively involved in the recoveries described in the overview - TAP 
		Pharmaceuticals, PacifiCare Health Systems, General American Life Insurance, 
		the State of California, American Medical Response, and the KPMG cases. 
		The following examples demonstrate the breadth and significance of other 
		cases in which the Division was involved during 2002.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Schering-Plough Corporation agreed to pay $500 million to resolve 
			allegations that the company did not manufacture drugs in compliance 
			with FDA regulations - for example, the company manufactured asthma 
			inhalers without the correct amount of medicine inside. The injunction 
			allows Schering to manufacture noncompliant products that FDA believes 
			are necessary to the public health, but requires Schering to disgorge 
			the profits obtained from the sale of those noncompliant products. 
			Schering also must make additional payments if it fails to bring these 
			medically necessary products into full compliance with FDA regulations 
			in a timely fashion.</li>
		<br>
		<br>
		<li>Lifemark Hospitals of Florida, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare Corporation 
			paid $29 million for allegedly submitting false Medicare claims for 
			services provided by three home health agencies. In another settlement, 
			Tenet paid $17 million to resolve allegations that 139 of its hospitals 
			overcharged multiple, federally insured health care programs for laboratory 
			services.</li>
		<br>
		<br>
		<li>In the Mariner Post-Acute Network bankruptcy, the court approved a 
			settlement in which Mariner, which operates nursing homes in 25 states, 
			will pay $26 million to resolve civil fraud liability. Additionally, 
			Mariner will forfeit its interest in $29 million to resolve Medicare 
			overpayment liabilities.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to these case-specific accomplishments, the Department's Nursing 
		Home Initiative, coordinated by the Civil Division, promotes, among other 
		things, increased prosecution and coordination at Federal, state and local 
		levels to fight the abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of the 
		nation's senior and infirm population. The Department is pursuing a growing 
		number of cases under the FCA involving providers' egregious "failures 
		of care." The financial crisis in the nursing home industry has to date 
		resulted in bankruptcy filings by five of the seven largest nursing home 
		chains and several smaller chains. These bankruptcy cases are the largest 
		ever involving health care providers, and raise the specter of failure 
		of care, as well as financial issues. The significance of these cases 
		require considerable and ongoing coordination among the Civil Division's 
		Corporate Finance and Civil Fraud sections, the Criminal Division, CMS, 
		and HHS/OIG. In addition, as part of the Nursing Home Initiative, the 
		Department, through the Office of Justice Programs, has made several grants 
		to further knowledge of the forensic aspects of elder abuse, to promote 
		prevention, and to assist local prosecutors in elder abuse, neglect, and 
		exploitation matters.</p>
	<p>Also, the Civil Division co-chairs with the Criminal Division the National 
		Level Health Care Fraud Working Group, which meets quarterly and coordinates 
		the health care fraud enforcement activities of all concerned Federal 
		and state agencies. </p>
	<p>Vital resources were made available from the Account to provide the Civil 
		Division with personnel, Automated Litigation Support, auditors, and consultants. 
		These resources supplemented other Civil Division funds. During 2002, 
		these monies were used to support a host of health care fraud matters 
		and the Department's tobacco litigation.</p>
	<p> 
	<h2 align="center"><b><a name="423"></a>Criminal Division</b> </h2>
	<p>The Fraud Section of the Criminal Division develops and implements white 
		collar crime policy and provides support for the Federal white collar 
		enforcement community. The Fraud Section supports the USAOs with legal 
		and investigative guidance and, in certain instances, provides trial attorneys 
		to prosecute criminal fraud cases. For several years, a major focus of 
		Fraud Section personnel and resources has been to investigate and prosecute 
		fraud involving Federal health care programs. </p>
	<p>The Fraud Section has provided guidance to FBI agents, AUSAs and Criminal 
		Division attorneys on criminal, civil and administrative tools to combat 
		health care fraud, and worked on an interagency level through:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>coordinating large scale multi-district health care fraud investigations;<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>providing frequent advice and written materials on confidentiality 
			and disclosure issues arising in the course of investigations and 
			legal proceedings regarding medical records; <br>
			<br>
		<li>monitoring and coordinating Departmental responses to major regulatory 
			initiatives, legislative proposals, and enforcement policy matters. 
			Examples include issues such as provider education and regulation, 
			medical records privacy, Internet sales of drugs and medical products 
			and expansion of the Medicare program to provide prescription drug 
			benefits; <br>
			<br>
		<li> reviewing and commenting on numerous requests for advisory opinions 
			submitted by health care providers to the HHS/OIG, and consulting 
			with the HHS/OIG on draft advisory opinions per the requirements of 
			HIPAA; <br>
			<br>
		<li>working with CMS officials to promote more effective use of technologies 
			and high-tech approaches for combating health care fraud and abuse. 
			Examples include co-sponsoring with CMS two regional conferences and 
			working with several USAOs to coordinate with CMS during its transition 
			to Program Safeguard Contractors for conducting anti-fraud detection 
			work in the Medicare program; <br>
			<br>
		<li>preparing and distributing to all USAOs and FBI field offices periodic 
			updates on major issues, interagency initiatives, and significant 
			activities of DOJ's health care fraud component organizations as well 
			as periodic summaries of recent cases; <br>
			<br>
		<li>organizing and overseeing, in conjunction with the Civil Division, 
			the National Level Health Care Fraud Working Group to address fraud 
			in health care and managed care; <br>
			<br>
		<li>participating in interagency working groups formed to address illicit 
			Internet sales of drugs and medical products and nursing home fraud 
			and resident abuse; 
	</ul>
	<p>The Fraud Section has responsibility for handling complex health care fraud 
		litigation nationwide and examples of successful prosecutions in 2002 
		include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HCMF Corporation, a privately owned nursing home chain in Virginia, 
			which was entitled under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to claim 
			reimbursement for the administrative costs associated with its operation 
			of eighteen nursing homes throughout Virginia, pleaded guilty to improperly 
			claiming reimbursement for salaries and benefits paid to more than 
			thirty HCMF owners, family members and employees who performed little 
			or no functions for nursing homes or whose duties were largely unrelated 
			to operating the homes. As part of its plea agreement, HCMF agreed 
			to pay restitution to these programs in the amount of $1.7 million, 
			was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to pay a $275,000 
			fine. Additionally, HCMF agreed to pay $250,000 of the costs of prosecution. 
			Both the Chairman of HCMF's Board of Directors and the Treasurer of 
			HCMF pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with 
			a Federal health care program, and concealing information from Medicare 
			and Medicaid so that HCMF could continue receiving reimbursement. 
			The Chairman was held jointly and severally liable for the restitution 
			amount, was sentenced to 30 months probation, and ordered to pay a 
			fine of $10,000. The Treasurer was sentenced to 24 months of probation, 
			with 50 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine. 
			In addition, these two officers, by virtue of their guilty pleas, 
			will be excluded from the health care benefit programs for at least 
			five years.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		<li>Two physicians, two licensed pharmacists, and four pharmacy and durable 
			medical equipment (DME) owners were convicted in the largest Medicare 
			fraud conspiracy trial in the Southern District of Florida. As part 
			of the conspiracy, the defendants paid patients for their Medicare 
			cards and for signing blank delivery receipts without receiving any 
			medication. The physician defendants issued fraudulent prescriptions 
			to the patients, ordered unnecessary tests, medical equipment and 
			medication, and thereafter the DME defendants forwarded the prescriptions 
			to co-conspirator pharmacies and submitted false bills to Medicare 
			in excess of $15 million for medication and medical equipment that 
			was never delivered. Additionally, the pharmacist and pharmacy owner 
			defendants, who were unwilling to buy expensive medications approved 
			by the FDA in the volumes necessary to fill prescriptions, manufactured 
			unnecessary, non-FDA approved medications through a process called 
			"compounding," and provided the DME companies with documentation reflecting 
			full deliveries of FDA-approved medications even though "compounded" 
			medications were supplied and often times only half or none of the 
			medication was actually delivered to the DME companies. Following 
			a 5 ½ month trial, a jury convicted the eight defendants of conspiracy 
			to defraud the United States and additionally convicted one defendant 
			of filing false claims, paying kickbacks, and conspiracy to commit 
			money laundering; a second defendant of paying kickbacks; and a third 
			defendant of filing false claims and paying kickbacks. Eighteen co-defendants 
			entered guilty pleas prior to trial.

	<h2 align="center"><b><a name="424"></a>Civil Rights Division</b> </h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>The Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division vigorously 
		pursues relief affecting public, residential health care facilities and 
		has established an Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect Initiative 
		to carry out the Department's initiative to eliminate abuse and grossly 
		substandard care in Medicare and Medicaid funded nursing homes and other 
		long-term care facilities. </p>
	<p>The Section plays a critical role in the HCFAC Program and is the sole 
		Department component responsible for the Civil Rights of Institutionalized 
		Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA). CRIPA authorizes investigation 
		of conditions of confinement at state and local residential institutions 
		(including facilities for persons with developmental disabilities or mental 
		illness, and nursing homes) and initiation of civil action for injunctive 
		relief to remedy a pattern or practice of violations of the constitution 
		or federal statutory rights. The review of conditions in facilities for 
		the mentally ill and for persons with developmental disabilities, and 
		nursing homes comprises a significant portion of the program. The Special 
		Litigation Section works collaboratively with the USAOs around the country 
		and with HHS.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
	<p>As part of the Department's Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect 
		Initiative, and as an enhancement to the Department's ongoing CRIPA enforcement 
		efforts, the Special Litigation Section staff reviewed conditions and 
		services at 60 nursing home facilities in 24 states during 2002. The task 
		in preliminary inquiries is to determine whether there is sufficient information 
		supporting allegations of unlawful conditions to warrant formal investigation 
		under CRIPA.</p>
	<p>The section reviews information pertaining to areas such as abuse and neglect, 
		medical and mental health care, use of restraints, fire and environmental 
		safety, and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual 
		needs. </p>
	<p>In 2002, the Special Litigation Section opened full CRIPA investigations 
		of four nursing homes: Mercer County Nursing Home in Trenton, New Jersey; 
		Nim Henson Geriatric Center in Breathitt County, Kentucky; Reginald P. 
		White Nursing Facility in Meridian, Mississippi; and Claudette Box Nursing 
		Facility in Mt. Vernon, Alabama. The Section resolved its CRIPA investigation 
		of the Long Term Care Division of the Bergen Regional Medical Center in 
		Paramus, New Jersey through a memorandum of understanding that provides 
		for improved medical care, accident and fall prevention, reduced use of 
		restraints and an assessment of whether the residents are being served 
		in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. </p>
	<p>Staff participated in ongoing nursing home investigations, including the 
		investigation of Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco, California, the 
		largest public nursing home facility in the United States; and Bradley 
		County Health Care and Rehabilitation Center in Cleveland, Tennessee. 
		Section staff also completed the investigation of Banks-Jackson-Commerce 
		Medical Center/Nursing Home in Commerce, Georgia, and sent a letter of 
		findings to appropriate public officials. These investigations involved 
		on site evaluation tours with expert consultants, review of documentary 
		evidence and interviews of staff. </p>
	<p>In 2002, the Division filed a joint motion to dismiss <u>United States</u> 
		v. <u>City of Philadelphia</u> (E.D. Pa.), its CRIPA case involving conditions 
		and practices at the Philadelphia Nursing Home. The court dismissed the 
		case based on the demonstrated compliance of the City in meeting the terms 
		of the consent decree.</p>
	<p>In addition, the staff conducted a new CRIPA investigation of one residential 
		facility for persons with developmental disabilities: New Lisbon Developmental 
		Center in New Lisbon, New Jersey. Special Litigation Section staff conducted 
		tours of the facility, accompanied by expert consultants, reviewed documents, 
		and interviewed facility staff. </p>
	<p>In 2002, the Section found that conditions and practices at two state-operated 
		facilities for persons with developmental disabilities, Woodward and Glenwood 
		Resource Centers in Iowa, violate the residents' federal constitutional 
		and statutory rights. The Division informed the State that the psychiatric 
		and psychological care and community placement programs at both Woodward 
		and Glenwood failed to meet accepted professional standards and that Woodward 
		is resorting to improperly restraining residents in lieu of adequate psychological 
		and behavioral services, treatment, and training. Finally, the Division 
		informed the Governor that the State is failing to ensure that residents 
		at both facilities are being served in the most integrated setting appropriate 
		to meet their individualized needs. </p>
	<p>The Section continued its investigations of the following residential facilities 
		for the developmentally disabled: Agnews and Sonora Developmental Centers 
		in California; Pinecrest and Hammond Developmental Centers in Louisiana; 
		Landmark Learning Center in Florida; Holly Center in Maryland; New Castle 
		Developmental Center in Indiana; Rainier Residential Rehabilitation Center 
		and Frances Haddon Morgan Centers in Washington; and Oakwood Developmental 
		Center in Kentucky. In many of these investigations, negotiations toward 
		settlement are continuing regarding the correction of remaining deficient 
		conditions. In some of these matters, the Section is reviewing voluntary 
		compliance to improve conditions. </p>
	<p>The Section also initiated an investigation of four mental health facilities 
		in North Carolina: John Umstead Hospital, Dorothea Dix Hospital, Cherry 
		Hospital and Broughton Hospital. The Section continued to review compliance 
		with a plan to correct identified deficiencies at Western State Hospital, 
		a mental health facility in Staunton, Virginia. </p>
	<p>The Section staff also conducted compliance reviews in ongoing CRIPA cases 
		involving a variety of facilities: <u>United States </u>v. <u>Tennessee</u> 
		(M.D. Tenn.) involving Clover Bottom Developmental Center, Harold Jordan 
		Center, and Greene Valley Developmental Center; <u>United States</u> v. 
		<u>Tennessee </u>(W.D. Tenn.) involving Arlington Developmental Center; 
		<u>United States</u> v. <u>Tennessee</u> (D. Tenn.) involving the Memphis 
		Mental Health Institute; <u>United States</u> v. <u>New Mexico</u> (D. 
		N. Mex.) involving the New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped; 
		<u>United States</u> v. <u>Connecticut</u> (D. Conn.) involving Southbury 
		Training School; <u>United States</u> v. <u>Hawaii</u> (D. Haw.) involving 
		Hawaii State Hospital and the community mental health system; and <u>United 
		States</u> v. <u>Indiana</u> involving Ft. Wayne Developmental Center 
		and Muscatatuck Developmental Center in Indiana. The Section is continuing 
		to pursue <u>Evans and United States</u> v. <u>Williams</u> (D. D.C.) 
		which was filed prior to the passage of CRIPA and involves hundreds of 
		community placements for members of the class with developmental disabilities 
		in the District of Columbia. In each of these cases, staff reviewed compliance 
		with the terms of previously filed agreements and court orders.</p>
	<p>In addition to its law enforcement activities, the Special Litigation Section 
		is responsible for representing the Civil Rights Division in the Department's 
		health care fraud activities. The Section participates, for example, as 
		a Department and Civil Rights representative on an inter-agency Nursing 
		Home Steering Committee. The Section has also participated in public education 
		and outreach by speaking and participating at both national and regional 
		conferences on quality of care in health care facilities.</p>

	<p>The FBI works many health care fraud cases on a joint basis with other 
		federal agencies, including the HHS/OIG. These two federal agencies collaborate 
		through attendance at health care fraud working groups and each other's 
		training conferences, case referral exchanges, and a liaison program between 
		the two organizations. In addition, most health care fraud task forces 
		formed by FBI field divisions represent the coordinated efforts among 
		the FBI, MFCUs and state and local law enforcement, federal investigative 
		agencies such as HHS/OIG, and private industry. The FBI and HHS/OIG continue 
		to share a common commitment to ending fragmented health care fraud enforcement 
		efforts and encouraging the coordination of investigative resources. The 
		FBI, however, is the only federal investigative agency to have jurisdiction 
		over both government sponsored health care programs and privately funded 
		health care programs. </p>
	<p>Under HIPAA, the FBI was provided $101 million in 2002 for health care 
		fraud enforcement. As the FBI has increased the number of agents assigned 
		to health care fraud investigations, the number of pending investigations 
		has increased over 400 percent, rising from 591 cases in 1992 to 2,418 
		cases through 2002. Federal and state criminal health care fraud convictions 
		resulting from FBI investigations have risen from 116 in 1992, to 549 
		through 2002. While the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks temporarily 
		affected the FBI's health care fraud enforcement program, health care 
		fraud investigations remain a priority at the FBI. In 2002, the FBI sponsored 
		training for approximately 100 agents having less than one year experience 
		investigating health care fraud matters, advanced financial analysis training 
		for health care support employees, and an advanced training covering the 
		latest schemes and investigative techniques. In addition, the FBI recently 
		dedicated additional training at Quantico for new agents to work on health 
		care fraud matters.</p>
	<p>The FBI continues to explore new ways to identify health care fraud. One 
		of the innovative techniques initiated in 2002 by the FBI, in partnership 
		with CMS, is the Medicare/Medicaid Data Analysis Center. This pilot project 
		is analyzing claims made to both the federal Medicare and state Medicaid 
		programs by the same providers in order to identify aberrant billing patterns, 
		unusual growth in billings and/or utilization of services or treatments, 
		billing for unusual time frames (i.e., more than 24 hours a day), and 
		other indicia of potential fraud against both programs. Analysis from 
		the project will be forwarded to the field divisions as health care referrals 
		in previously undetected areas of fraud. The FBI expects to expand this 
		pilot project in 2003. </p>
	<p>A considerable portion of the increased funding was utilized to support 
		major health care fraud investigations. In addition, operational support 
		has been provided for FBI national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical 
		diversion, chiropractic fraud, medical clinics, and transportation providers. 
		Further, the FBI continues to support individual field offices with equipment 
		and to assist in various individual investigations.</p>
