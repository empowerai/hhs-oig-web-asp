        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
      </center>
    </H1>
    <HR width="70%">
    <P>The detection and eradication of health care fraud and abuse is a top priority 
      of federal law enforcement. Our efforts to combat fraud were consolidated 
      and strengthened considerably by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
      Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and 
      Abuse Control Program (Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney 
      General and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services 
      (HHS)<A href="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, acting through the Department's 
      Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed to coordinate federal, state and local 
      law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and abuse. 
      HIPAA made available much needed and powerful new criminal and civil enforcement 
      tools and financial resources that permitted the government to expand and 
      intensify the fight against health care fraud. 
    <P> 
    <P>The second year of operation under the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control 
      Program saw continuing returns to the Medicare Trust Fund, a rise in the 
      number of individuals excluded from participation in federally-funded health 
      care programs, and the initiation and enhancement of important efforts to 
      <EM>prevent</EM> health care fraud and to safeguard the quality of care 
      furnished to beneficiaries under those programs. 
    <P><STRONG>Civil and Criminal Enforcement Actions</STRONG> 
    <P>Federal prosecutors filed 322 criminal cases in health care fraud cases 
      in 1998 -- a 
    <P>14 percent increase over the previous year, and 326 defendants were convicted 
      of health care fraud-related crimes. Also in 1998, 107 civil cases were 
      filed, and at the end of the year 3,471 civil matters were pending. 
    <P> 
    <P><STRONG>Monetary Results</STRONG> 
    <P>In 1998, the Federal Government won or negotiated more than $480 million 
      in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care 
      fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well as 
      prior-year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the Federal 
      Government in 1998 collected $296 million. It should be noted that some 
      of the judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in 1998 will 
      result in collections in future years, just as some of the collections in 
      1998 are attributable to actions from prior years. 
    <P> 
    <P>More than 92 percent ($271 million) of the funds collected and disbursed 
      in 1998 were returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional $9 million 
      was recovered as the federal share of Medicaid restitution. 
    <P><STRONG>Exclusion from Federally Sponsored Programs</STRONG> 
    <P>HIPAA expanded and strengthened the government's ability to prohibit companies 
      or individuals who have been convicted of certain health care offenses, 
      lost their licenses, or engaged in other professional misconduct from participating 
      in Medicare, Medicaid or other federally sponsored health care programs. 
      In 1998, HHS excluded 3,021 individuals and entities, an increase of 11 
      percent over 1997. 
    <P><STRONG>Administrative Penalties for "Patient Dumping"</STRONG> 
    <P>The government expanded its efforts under the Patient Anti-Dumping Statute, 
      which requires hospitals' emergency departments to provide emergency medical 
      screening and stabilizing treatment to individuals needing emergency care. 
      Settlement agreements were entered into with 53 hospitals and physicians 
      -- up from a previous high of 18 settlements in 1996 -- and a record $1.8 
      million in civil monetary penalties was collected. 
    <P><STRONG>Preventing Health Care Fraud</STRONG> 
    <P>Preventing health care fraud and abuse is a central component of the Program. 
      The Program's prevention efforts include the promulgation of formal advisory 
      opinions to industry on proposed business practices, industry-specific program 
      compliance guidance, special fraud alerts, corporate integrity agreements 
      with providers who settle allegations of fraud, beneficiary and provider 
      education and outreach, and substantial implemented program improvements.

      ANNUAL REPORT OF <BR>
      THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SECRETARY <BR>
      DETAILING EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES <BR>
      UNDER THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL PROGRAM <BR>
      FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998 
      <P>As Required by <BR>

    <P> 
      <CENTER>
        <STRONG><U>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</U></STRONG> 
      </CENTER>
    <P> 
    <P>The Social Security Act Section 1128C(a), as established by the Health 
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA 
      or the Act), created the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (Program), 
      a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse in health care, including 
      both public and private health plans. 
    <P>The Act requires that an amount equal to collections from health care investigations 
      -- including criminal fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, 
      and administrative penalties, but excluding restitution, compensation to 
      the victim agency and relators' shares -- be deposited in the Medicare<A href="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
      Trust Fund. All funds deposited in the Trust Fund as a result of the Act 
      are available for the operations of the Trust Fund. 
    <P>The Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund to an expenditure 
      account, called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (Account), 
      in amounts that the Attorney General and the Secretary jointly certify are 
      necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. The maximum amounts available 
      for expenditure are specified in the Act. Certain of these sums are to be 
      available only for activities of the HHS/OIG, with respect to Medicare and 
      Medicaid programs. In 1998, the second year of the Program, the Attorney 
      General and the Secretary certified 
    <P>$119.6 million for appropriation to the Account. A detailed breakdown of 
      the allocation of these funds is set forth later in this report. These resources 
      supplement the direct appropriations of HHS and DOJ that are devoted to 
      health care fraud enforcement. (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
      (FBI) received $56 million from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.) 
    <P>Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the 
      Program's goals are: 
    <P>(1) to coordinate federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating 
      to health care fraud and abuse; 
    <P>(2) to conduct investigations, audits, and evaluations relating to the 
      delivery of and payment for health care in the United States; 
    <P>(3) to facilitate enforcement of all applicable remedies for such fraud; 
    <P>(4) to provide guidance to the health care industry regarding fraudulent 
      practices; and 
    <P>(5) to establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse 
      actions against health care providers. 
    <P>The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit a joint 
      annual report to the Congress which identifies: 
    <P>(A) the amounts appropriated to the HI Trust Fund for the previous fiscal 
      year under various categories and the source of such amounts; and 
    <P>(B) the amounts appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use 
      by the Attorney General and the Secretary and the justification for the 
      expenditure of such amounts. 
    <P>This annual report is submitted in fulfillment of the above statutory requirements.

    As required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the 
    amounts deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source 
    of such deposits. In 1998, as a result of the combined anti-fraud actions 
    of the federal and state governments and others, the Federal Government collected 
    $296 million in connection with health care fraud cases and matters<A href="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>. 
    These funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and Health 
    Care Financing Administration (HCFA), transferred to other federal agencies 
    administering health care programs, or paid to private persons. The following

    <H3>Overview of Accomplishments</H3>
    <P><STRONG>Collections</STRONG> 
    <P>During this year, the Federal Government won or negotiated more than $480 
      million in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health 
      care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well 
      as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the 
      Federal Government in 1998 collected $296 million in cases resulting from 
      health care fraud and abuse, of which $271 million was returned to the Medicare 
      Trust Fund, and $9 million was recovered as the federal share of Medicaid 
      restitution. It should be emphasized that some of the judgments, settlements, 
      and administrative impositions in 1998 will result in collections in future 
      years, just as some of the collections in 1998 are attributable to actions 
      from prior years. 
    <P><STRONG>Judgments/Settlements</STRONG> 
    <P>Working together, we have brought to successful conclusion the investigation 
      and prosecution of numerous costly health care fraud schemes. These investigations 
      were not limited to providers and suppliers of health care services -- 1998 
      saw the conclusion of two major investigations involving allegations of 
      fraud on the part of the contractors who process claims on behalf of the 
      Medicare program: 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>Health Care Services Corporation, the Medicare carrier for Illinois 
        and Michigan agreed to pay the government $140 million in settlement of 
        a <EM>qui tam</EM> suit alleging that it shredded claims, altered documents 
        and otherwise manipulated data relied on by HCFA to evaluate its contract 
        performance. In addition to the civil settlement, the corporation agreed 
        to plead guilty to obstructing a federal audit, conspiracy to obstruct 
        a federal audit, and making false statements to HCFA which will result 
        in a $4 million criminal fine. In order to guard against future misconduct, 
        and to ensure that any potential lapses are detected early, the government 
        and the corporation also entered into a strict corporate integrity agreement. 
        We anticipate collecting these funds in the next fiscal year. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>PBSXACT, the Medicare carrier for several mid-Atlantic states, resolved 
        a 2-year investigation by agreeing to pay $38.5 million in settlement 
        of allegations that it improperly processed Medicare secondary payor claims, 
        neglected to recover overpayments, bypassed certain computer payment safeguards, 
        and failed to implement required screens for certain lab tests, all of 
        which resulted in false claims to the Medicare program. Again, the contractor 
        agreed to undertake corporate integrity obligations, including training 
        and external reviews of its performance. </LI>

      <LI><U>Physicians at Teaching Hospitals:</U> In the sixth resolution of 
        a case in the Physicians at Teaching Hospitals or "PATH" project, the 
        government reached settlement with a state university school of medicine 
        for allegedly billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs in violation 
        of rules governing payment for physician services rendered by residents 
        and interns. The University of Pittsburgh agreed to pay $17 million to 
        settle potential liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary 
        Penalties Laws. The government took steps to prevent future improper claims 
        by negotiating a corporate integrity agreement that, in part, requires 
        periodic audits and reports by the university for a period of five years. 
        <P></P>
      <LI><U>Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) 72 Hour Window Project:</U> A joint 
        nationwide project targeting improper Medicare claims by hospitals for 
        outpatient services continued in 1998. Medicare reimbursement of hospitals 
        for inpatient services includes compensation for related outpatient services, 
        such as laboratory tests, provided during the three days preceding the 
        day of admission and during the hospital stay. In addition to recouping 
        charges for amounts improperly paid to hospitals, the settlements under 
        this project require hospitals to establish internal controls to prevent 
        submission of such improper Medicare claims. As of September 30, 1998, 
        2,483 hospitals had settled with the United States, agreeing to pay a 
        total of $63,849,947. The project is expected to continue into 1999. </LI>

    <P><STRONG>Quality of Care</STRONG> 
    <P>The destructive impact of fraudulent billing is not measured in dollars 
      only. During 1998, the Program also stepped up pursuit of investigations 
      and prosecutions that directly affect the <EM>quality</EM> of care provided 
      to Medicare, Medicaid and other beneficiaries of government funded health 
      care programs. During 1998, the government utilized the False Claims Act 
      to proceed against nursing homes that furnished substandard, even dangerous, 
      patient care. For example, Chester Care, a chain of three nursing homes 
      in suburban Philadelphia settled an action alleging grossly deficient patient 
      care, in one case resulting in the scalding death of a patient, in which 
      the homes were required to institute rigorous and extensive quality of care 
      compliance provisions. These standards included strict guidelines for the 
      care of nursing home residents with diabetes; standards that in many respects 
      exceed professional standards in the industry. Enforcement of the standards 
      is ensured by an independent monitor; for the worst of the three homes, 
      an outside manager was instituted to oversee all aspects of the facility 
      until such time as HCFA finds that the home has returned to compliance. 
    <P>The government also concluded its investigation of a publicly owned nursing 
      home for allegations of substandard care (including excessive use of restraints, 
      lack of cleanliness, and a high level of injuries among patients). Again, 
      in settlement of the action, the facility agreed to implement specific protocols 
      to ensure quality of care, and to employ a monitor to ensure full implementation 
      and further safeguard the patients. The impetus for these and similar actions 
      is not only to obtain compensation for the government's losses, but also 
      to prevent future violations and protect patient safety. 
    <P><STRONG>Prevention</STRONG> 
    <P>The Program also continues to focus on <EM>prevention</EM> of health care 
      fraud and abuse through inclusion of rigorous corporate integrity provisions 
      in settlements with alleged offenders, industry-specific program compliance 
      guidance, formal advisory opinions, special fraud alerts, beneficiary outreach, 
      and exclusions from program participation. 
    <P>A more detailed description of these and other accomplishments of the major 
      federal participants in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA follows. 
      While information in this report is presented in the context of a single 
      agency, most of these accomplishments reflect the combined efforts of HHS, 
      DOJ and other partners in the anti-fraud efforts. The continuing accomplishments 
      of the HHS and DOJ and our partners in the coordinated anti-fraud effort, 
      as well as prevention efforts, demonstrate that the increased funds to battle 
      health care fraud and abuse continue to be sound investments.

    <P> 
    <P>Certain of the funds appropriated under HIPAA are, by statute, set aside 
      for Medicare and Medicaid activities of the HHS/OIG. During the second year 
      of the Program, the Act provides that between $80 and $90 million be devoted 
      to these purposes. The Attorney General and the Secretary jointly allotted 
      $85.7 million to the HHS/OIG in 1998, an increase of $15.7 million over 
      1997. 
    <P>With these increased resources, HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 1,114 
      successful prosecutions or settlements in 1998. For the second straight 
      year, there was a significant rise in the number of individuals and entities 
      excluded from doing business with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and 
      state health care programs. A total of 3,021 individuals and entities were 
      so excluded, many as a result of criminal convictions for program-related 
      crimes (584) and criminal convictions for patient abuse or neglect (302). 
      Others were excluded based on licensure revocations (1,251) or other professional 
      misconduct. Overall, there was an 11 percent increase in exclusions (from 
      the 2,700 exclusions in 1997). 
    <P>In addition to the OIG's role in bringing about the judgments and settlements 
      described in the Overview of Accomplishments, HHS acted on OIG recommendations 
      and disallowed $27.7 million in improperly paid health care funds in 1998. 
      HHS/OIG continues to work with HCFA to develop and implement recommendations 
      to correct systemic vulnerabilities detected during HHS/OIG evaluations 
      and audits. These corrective actions often result in health care funds not 
      expended (that is, funds put to better use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG 
      initiatives). In 1998, such funds not expended on improper or unnecessary 
      care amounted to approximately $10.8 billion -- nearly $8.3 billion in Medicare 
      savings, and nearly $2.6 billion in savings to the Medicaid program. 
    <P>HHS/OIG moved closer to its goal of extending its investigative and audit 
      staffs to cover <EM>all</EM> geographical areas in the country, particularly 
      those that were under served during lean budget years. During 1998, overall 
      HHS/OIG staff levels increased from 1,126 to 1,258, and HHS/OIG opened five 
      new investigative offices. The staff increases also strengthened the office's 
      ability to conduct rapid national evaluations that provide policymakers 
      with factual information, analysis and recommendations for improving HHS 
      programs. The outcomes of these inspections lead to increased cost savings, 
      improved quality of care or services, improved program efficiency and the 
      identification of program vulnerabilities. 
    <P><STRONG>Focus on Prevention</STRONG> 
    <P>Affirmative enforcement, with an eye toward prosecution or recovery of 
      misspent funds, has been and remains a key role of the HHS/OIG. However, 
      with the increased resources made available under HIPAA, the HHS/OIG has 
      also continued to expand activities designed not just to uncover existing 
      fraud and abuse, but to <EM>prevent</EM> it. 
    <P>A cornerstone of HHS/OIG's prevention efforts has been the development 
      of compliance program guidance to encourage and assist the private health 
      care industry to fight fraud and abuse. The guidance, developed in consultation 
      with DOJ and the provider community, identifies steps that health providers 
      may voluntarily take to improve adherence to Medicare and Medicaid rules. 
      Each guidance sets forth seven elements that the HHS/OIG considers necessary 
      for a comprehensive compliance program and identifies risk areas for the 
      specific industry sector. In 1998, the OIG issued compliance program guidance 
      for use by hospitals and home health agencies, and issued a revised guidance 
      for clinical laboratories. The HHS/OIG also solicited input from the durable 
      medical equipment industry on issues that should be addressed in upcoming 
      guidance for that health care sector. 
    <P>With increasing frequency, health care providers that enter agreements 
      with the government in settlement of potential liability for violations 
      of the False Claims Act also agree to adhere to a separate "corporate integrity 
      agreement." Under this agreement, the provider commits to establishing a 
      compliance program or undertaking other specified steps to ensure their 
      future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules. The duration of most 
      corporate integrity agreements is 3 to 5 years, during which time the provider 
      must submit an annual report to HHS/OIG on its compliance activities. At 
      the close of 1998, the OIG was monitoring approximately 350 agreements; 
      a total of 231 corporate integrity agreements were entered into in 1998. 
    <P>Industry outreach and education is another critical component of fraud 
      prevention. During this past year, the HHS/OIG issued final regulations, 
      in consultation with DOJ, implementing a process for issuing written advisory 
      opinions to the public on the sanction authorities enforced by HHS/OIG, 
      including the anti-kickback statute and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. 
      In 1998, HHS/OIG issued 15 advisory opinions on a wide range of concerns. 
      Moreover, HHS/OIG received 21 requests for opinions in the last quarter 
      of the year, almost 40 percent of the total requests for the year, reflecting 
      growing industry recognition of the value of the advisory opinion process. 
      In addition, HHS/OIG issued a special fraud alert on financial relationships 
      between hospices and nursing homes, as well as presented frequent speeches 
      to industry groups on areas of suspected fraud and abuse and measures they 
      can take to avoid trouble. 
    <P>Enlisting beneficiaries as partners in fighting fraud assists in identifying 
      abuses at an early stage, and preventing ongoing or widespread abuse. An 
      HHS/OIG survey found that Medicare beneficiaries are well-positioned to 
      identify fraud, with three out of four stating that they "always" read their 
      Explanation of Medicare Benefit statements. The HHS/OIG continues to work 
      with the Administration on Aging, HCFA, and the American Association of 
      Retired Persons to develop an outreach campaign to educate beneficiaries 
      and those who work with the elderly to recognize fraud and abuse and to 
      report it appropriately. This campaign will be fully "launched" in 1999. 
      The beneficiary outreach program, in part, encourages individuals to contact 
      the HHS/OIG Hotline, 1-800-HHS-TIPS, which receives complaints of improprieties 
      in Medicare and other HHS programs. In 1998, the Hotline received over 76,000 
      calls (up from 58,000 in 1997), which resulted in more than 12,500 complaints. 
      Approximately $1.04 million in collections are associated with complaints 
      referred to and resolved by HCFA and its contractors. 
    <P>There is a final, and critically important HHS/OIG effort to prevent fraud 
      and abuse. Frequently, investigations (and resulting civil settlements or 
      criminal prosecutions), audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or 
      incentives for fraud in agency programs or administrative processes. As 
      required by the Inspector General Act, the HHS/OIG makes recommendations 
      to correct these vulnerabilities, and thereby promote economy and efficiency 
      in HHS programs and operations. Relying on the independent factual information 
      generated by HHS/OIG, agency managers fashion legislative proposals and 
      other corrective action that, when enacted or implemented, close loopholes 
      and avoid ineffective expenditures or improper conduct. The savings from 
      these joint efforts toward program improvements can be vast. Among the OIG 
      studies that provided evidence and ideas supporting proposals for significant 
      cost savings during 1998, and studies conducted in 1998 that will likely 
      reap such savings in the future are: 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI><U>Home Health</U> - A combination of OIG investigations, audits, and 
        evaluations helped support a general reform of home health services provided 
        by Medicare. Legislation was recently enacted to strengthen and protect 
        the Medicare home health benefit, by establishing payment on a prospective 
        basis for each episode of care, rather than on a visit-by-visit basis. 
        An interim payment system will control reimbursements until the prospective 
        payment system is implemented. The legislation also requires agencies 
        to purchase surety bonds, eliminates periodic interim payments, requires 
        home health agency owners to submit their social security numbers and 
        detailed information about related businesses, authorizes HCFA to re-enroll 
        agencies every 3 years, and gives HCFA more power to refuse to enter into 
        agreements with suspect individuals or companies. 
        <P></P>
      <LI><U>Nursing Homes</U> - Similarly, new legislation has reformed the way 
        Medicare pays for nursing home services. Again, the new policy adopts 
        a prospective payment system for nursing home stays covered under Medicare 
        Part A. Under new "consolidated billing," nursing facilities must also 
        submit bills for Part B-covered services to Medicare for residents who 
        are either Medicaid or private pay. 
        <P></P>
      <LI><U>Prescription Drugs</U> - In response to HHS/OIG findings and recommendations 
        that showed Medicare paid more for prescription drugs than the Medicaid 
        program and that Medicare payments greatly exceeded suppliers' acquisition 
        costs, Congress reduced Medicare payment rates for drugs by 5 percent. 
        The new legislation also authorized HCFA to make inherent reasonableness 
        adjustments of up to 15 percent to all Part B services except physician 
        services. 
        <P></P>
      <LI><U>Hospice Care</U> - A combination of audit and evaluation reports 
        were the subject of numerous congressional hearings and media coverage 
        that resulted in heightened awareness of problems with hospice care especially 
        when provided in nursing homes. New legislation provides more frequent 
        certification of eligibility for the hospice benefit. This will help control 
        costs while improving the overall quality of care for Medicare patients 
        facing death. In addition, the OIG issued a Fraud Alert to the public 
        regarding problems of coordination of hospice benefits with nursing home 
        patients. </LI>
    </UL>
    <P>In addition to this work already completed, the OIG continues to develop 
      new proposals and new ideas to ensure the integrity of the Medicare program. 
    <P><STRONG>Focus on Quality of Care</STRONG> 
    <P>Some of the HHS/OIG's most important investigations, audits and evaluations 
      focused on the <EM>quality</EM> of care furnished to program beneficiaries. 
      A number of these investigations are described in the "Overview of Accomplishments" 
      section of this report. Others include: 
    <UL>
      <P> 
      <LI>Investigation revealed that the Northern Louisiana Rehabilitation Hospital 
        was billing Medicare for services that were medically unnecessary or provided 
        no benefit to the Medicare patient. The hospital also delayed discharging 
        Medicare patients in order to bill additional services to Medicare. The 
        hospital and its majority stock holder agreed to pay nearly $4.5 million 
        in settlement of these allegations of false claims to Medicare. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>In partnership with the Illinois State Medicaid agency, the HHS/OIG 
        investigated Home Pharmacy Service, Inc, a pharmacy that provided services 
        to nursing homes, for failing to return unused medications after the resident 
        died. Instead, the pharmacy allegedly reused the medications, thereby 
        both potentially endangering patients and submitting false claims to Medicaid. 
        The pharmacy settled these allegations for $5.3 million. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>Corporate integrity agreements can also be an important instrument in 
        safeguarding patient quality of care. For example, Charter Behavioral, 
        a psychiatric hospital, agreed to having a monitor selected by the government 
        to oversee the medical necessity for and duration of each admission, and 
        otherwise review the quality of patient care. As mentioned in the Overview 
        of Accomplishments, a Pennsylvania nursing home also signed a settlement 
        agreement that included strict guidelines for the care of nursing home 
        patients with diabetes. </LI>
    </UL>
    <P>Both HCFA and the HHS/OIG have significantly stepped up enforcement actions 
      under the patient anti-dumping statute. Federal law requires that an emergency 
      medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment be provided by the 
      emergency department of a Medicare participating hospital. The HHS/OIG is 
      currently investigating over 150 instances, in which individuals were allegedly 
      refused medical screening or treatment that were analyzed and referred by 
      HCFA. In 1998, HHS/OIG entered 53 settlement agreements with hospitals and 
      physicians and collected civil monetary penalties of $1.8 million. This 
      is a marked increase from the previous high of 18 settlements in 1996, and 
      reflects the commitment of both HCFA and HHS/OIG to ensure patient access 
      to appropriate emergency medical services. 
    <P>Elder abuse in nursing homes is of growing concern. An HHS/OIG review concluded 
      that state safeguards do not ensure that potentially dangerous applicants 
      are identified and denied employment in nursing homes. States rely on a 
      patchwork of measures, such as criminal background checks and screens of 
      nurse aide registries. These safeguards vary widely among the states. Moreover, 
      where screens exist, they often apply only to "in-state" records that do 
      not include information on some individuals' criminal histories. 
    <P><STRONG>Training</STRONG> 
    <P>The Office of Investigations (OI) has held numerous conferences and training 
      seminars during the first two years of HIPAA. These include two durable 
      medical equipment conferences; eight HCFA contractor fraud unit training 
      seminars and one conference on fraud in home health agencies. Outreach programs 
      on durable medical equipment and home health agencies were given in coordination 
      with the HCFA contractor fraud units throughout the country to members of 
      the health care community. In addition, OI personnel have made presentations 
      to provider organizations on current issues of health care fraud and abuse. 
      The organizations include hospital, home health, hospice and nursing home 
      associations. 
    <P><STRONG>Other Initiatives to Combat Health Care Fraud and Abuse</STRONG> 
    <P>The annual audit of HCFA's financial statements (mandated by the Chief 
      Financial Officers Act and the Government Management Reform Act) provides 
      an objective evaluation of the reliability of those statements and, importantly, 
      an evaluation of financial management processes, systems and internal controls. 
      The fiscal year 1997 audit, jointly funded by HHS/OIG and HCFA, noted an 
      improvement in federal financial accountability. HHS/OIG issued a qualified 
      opinion; an improvement over the disclaimer issued for the previous year. 
      Because of continuing problems, however, OIG was unable to issue an unqualified 
      (or "clean") opinion. The audit report estimated that improper Medicare 
      fee-for-service payments in 1997 amounted to about 
    <P>$20.3 billion, or about 11 percent of the total $177.4 billion in fee-for-service 
      payments. Much of these improper payments were the result of insufficient 
      or no medical documentation of the services, lack of medical necessity, 
      incorrect coding, and unallowable services. The audit did not determine 
      what portion of these improper payments are attributable to fraud. Additionally, 
      OIG identified systemic internal control problems. HCFA continues to work 
      with the HHS/OIG in its efforts to complete corrective action. 
    <P>With more than six million Medicare beneficiaries receiving health care 
      services through managed care plans (as of February 1998), the HHS/OIG conducted 
      various reviews assessing this health care delivery option. Among these, 
      the HHS/OIG evaluated beneficiary and provider satisfaction with HMOs and 
      other managed care plans, reviewed the components of the administrative 
      costs included in calculating the adjusted community rate and recommended 
      that legislation be sought that would exclude inappropriate expenses that 
      currently inflate that rate beyond what is Medicare's "fair share" (with 
      a potential cost saving of $1 billion); and made recommendations to improve 
      beneficiaries' access to services. <A name=g></A>

      has a mandatory appropriation to support its Medicare Integrity Program<A href="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>, 
      however, appropriations for the integrity program cannot be used in support 
      of activities conducted directly by agency personnel.

      fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.

      <LI><STRONG>Medicare Satellite Offices</STRONG>. $720,000 in HCFAC funds 
        were used to continue Satellite Office operations in Miami and to open 
        a new satellite office in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
        <P>Satellite Offices' support newly established, cross-jurisdictional 
          partnerships with various entities that had previously worked in isolation 
          to combat fraud. Specifically, Satellite Office staff are charged with 
          working directly with staff of other federal agencies, various law enforcement 
          agencies, relevant state agencies and various private companies to function 
          as a "hub" coordinating and helping avoid duplication in the fraud prevention, 
          detection and elimination efforts of these partners. 
        <P>The New Orleans Office opened mid-year and spent a considerable portion 
          of 1998 getting established; the Miami office continued to enjoy the 
          success needed to demonstrate the viability of the Satellite Office. 
          Since 1996, the Miami office, working collaboration with its partners 
          in Florida, has identified significant fraudulent and abusive claims 
          against the Medicare and Medicaid programs, resulting in the identification 
          of $75 million in overpayments. In addition, the collaborative projects 
          focused on identifying the root causes of fraud, waste and abuse, so 
          that corrective action could be taken and further occurrences prevented.

    <P>The Act mandates that the HHS/OIG and DOJ establish a national health care 
      fraud and abuse data collection program for the reporting and disclosure 
      of certain final adverse actions (excluding settlements in which no findings 
      of liability have been made) taken against health care providers, suppliers, 
      and practitioners. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
      is authorized to design, implement and operate this program, currently named 
      the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). In 1998, HRSA 
      was allocated $1&nbsp;million from the Account to further development of 
      the HIPDB. 
    <P>The HIPDB initial operating capability stage was completed and tested in 
      March&nbsp;1998. The next stage of development included the addition of 
      systems capability to receive adverse licensure and certification reports, 
      as well as reports of other adverse federal and state actions, on health 
      care practitioners. The HIPDB also was developed to receive reports of all 
      types of health care related final adverse actions against health care providers 
      and suppliers. The first generation of the HIPDB will be substantially complete 
      by May&nbsp;1999. Pursuant to the Act, the HIPDB may not open for operations

    <P>The HIPDB system has undergone and successfully completed Y2K compliance 
      testing to ensure that dates beginning with the year 2000 will not disrupt 
      operations. Once the HIPDB becomes operational, the query fee payment will 
      be collected via an interface with Mellon Bank. This link is the only part

      as well as its 10 regional offices provide legal support under the HCFAC

    <P>OGC was allocated $2.2 million in HCFAC funding for 1998. These funds were 
      used for litigation activity, both administrative and judicial. OGC continues 
      to experience an increase in the number of new litigation items: a 104 percent 
      increase in 1997 and a 17 percent increase in 1998. The bulk of the administrative 
      (non-court) litigation involved: (1) civil money penalties (CMP) imposed 
      on Medicare nursing facilities; (2) revocations, terminations or denials 
      of provider status (especially home health agencies, nursing facilities, 
      and Community Mental Health Centers); (3) Medicare Secondary Payor (MSP) 
      cases; and, (4) Medicare suspensions of payments to providers and suppliers. 
      The bulk of the court litigation involved MSPs or bankruptcies.

      <P> 
      <LI>Prospective Payment System (PPS) Transfer Recovery Project: OGC's HCF 
        Division has been assisting OIG and DOJ in a nationwide False Claims Act 
        initiative. HHS/OIG has been investigating certain PPS hospitals that 
        improperly code patients as being discharged from the hospital when the 
        patients have, in fact, been transferred to another PPS hospital. Medicare 
        regulations allow a hospital to receive the full DRG payment for a patient 
        who is discharged from the hospital. Hospitals that transfer patients 
        to another PPS hospital, however, are entitled to receive only a per diem 
        payment for the actual length of stay at the first hospital. The OIG's 
        investigation has found that thousands of hospitals miscoded transfers 
        of patients as discharges, causing Medicare to pay the full DRG payment 
        improperly to both the transferor and transferee hospitals. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>OGC's Region I office, working with HCFA, defended HCFA against a legal 
        challenge brought by a large national nursing home chain. In a case involving 
        one of the chain's facilities in Region I, OGC's assistance resulted in 
        the termination of the facility's Medicare provider agreement, and the 
        imposition of a CMP in the amount of $637,000. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>Region III, in collaboration with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia, 
        issued the first joint DOJ/HCFA Consent Order against a skilled nursing 
        facility in a fraud case. The facility and two related facilities agreed 
        to pay $500,000 in CMPs; implement staffing changes pursuant to federal 
        regulations; and, adopt a corporate compliance program. 
        <P></P>
      <LI>The Region V office had a record high 940 new MSP cases filed in 1998. 
        Contributing to this were partnership arrangements with contractors and 
        U.S. Attorneys in Michigan and Ohio as well as a new notice letter to 
        assist fiscal intermediaries in recoveries. This effort contributed to 
        nearly $3.6 million in Medicare recoveries through MSP litigation.

      <LI>OGC's Region VI in cooperation with HCFA, was instrumental in suspending

        <STRONG>United States Attorneys</STRONG> 
      </CENTER>
    <P>Health care fraud involves many different types of schemes that defraud 
      Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or other insurers 
      or providers. The fraudulent activity may include double billing schemes, 
      kickbacks, billing for unnecessary or unperformed tests, or may be related 
      to the quality of the medical care provided. United States Attorneys' offices 
      (USAOs) criminally and civilly prosecute health care professionals, providers, 
      and other specialized business entities who engage in health care fraud, 
      and work with the Department's Civil and Criminal Divisions, and the FBI. 
    <P>USAOs continue to cooperate closely with numerous federal, state and local 
      law enforcement agencies who are involved in the prevention, evaluation, 
      detection, and investigation of health care fraud. In addition to the HHS/OIG 
      and HCFA, these agencies include the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units; 
      Inspectors General Offices of other federal agencies; the Drug Enforcement 
      Administration; Department of Defense, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; 
      and the TRICARE Support Office in the Department of Defense. 
    <P>To assist in coordination and communication at national, state, and local 
      levels, each USAO has appointed both a criminal and civil health care fraud 
      coordinator. Prior to the enactment of HIPAA, USAOs dedicated substantial 
      resources to combating health care fraud, HIPAA allocations have supplemented 
      these efforts. 
    <P><STRONG>Training</STRONG> 
    <P>The Executive Office for the United States Attorneys' Office of Legal Education 
      (OLE) is tasked with the responsibility for providing health care fraud 
      training for USAO, and DOJ attorneys, investigators, and auditors. During 
      1998, OLE conducted a number of presentations and complete courses on health 
      care fraud, including:

    </UL>
    <P>While the primary student body at each of these courses were DOJ employees, 
      personnel from HHS/OIG and other agencies were also invited to participate 
      as presenters and students. Additionally, USAO attorneys, investigators 
      and auditors participated in a number of non-OLE sponsored, multi-agency 
      health care fraud training courses over the last year. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Criminal Prosecutions</STRONG> 
    <P>The primary objective of criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the 
      integrity of our Nation's health care programs and to punish and deter those 
      who, through their fraudulent activities, abuse the health care system and 
      the taxpayers. 
    <P>Each time a criminal case is referred to a USAO from the FBI, HHS/OIG, 
      or other law enforcement agency, it is opened as a matter pending in the 
      district. A case remains a matter until an indictment or information is 
      filed or the case is declined for prosecution. In 1998, the USAOs had 1,866 
      criminal matters pending involving 2,986 defendants, a 23 percent increase 
      over 1997. 322 cases were filed with 439 defendants. This represents a 14 
      percent increase over cases filed in 1997. Health care fraud convictions 
      include both guilty pleas and guilty verdicts. During 1998, there were 219 
      criminal health care fraud convictions, involving 326 defendants. 
    <P>In one case, the owner of The Human Resources Inc. Concept, pleaded guilty 
      to charges that he defrauded the Medicaid program of $7.3 million by billing 
      it for individual and group psychotherapy sessions allegedly provided to 
      children attending after-school and summer day camp programs. After 4 days 
      of trial testimony, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy 
      and mail fraud. The defendant and others recruited inner-city school children, 
      who were eligible for Medicaid, to enter after-school and summer school 
      programs at a community center and roller skating rink. These programs were 
      promoted as providing academic and cultural enrichment and recreational 
      opportunities. The defendant directed employees to go door-to-door in poor 
      areas to recruit children without telling the parents that Medicaid would 
      be billed for individual or group psychotherapy sessions. Parents testified 
      that they had not enrolled their children for psychotherapy sessions, and 
      that their children did not need those services. Several former employees 
      testified that psychological counseling was not provided. On September 30, 
      1998 the defendant was sentenced to 3 years and 10 months in federal prison, 
      and ordered to pay $7.3 million in restitution. 
    <P><STRONG>Accomplishments - Civil Cases</STRONG> 
    <P>Civil health care fraud efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative 
      Civil Enforcement (ACE) activities. The ACE Program is a powerful legal 
      tool used to help ensure that federal laws are obeyed, and that violators 
      provide compensation to the government for losses and damages they cause 
      as a result of fraud, waste, and abuse. Civil health care fraud matters 
      ordinarily involve the United States utilizing the False Claims Act, as 
      well as the common law of fraud, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment and 
      conversion, to recover damages from those who have knowingly submitted false 
      or fraudulent claims. Additionally, in conjunction with a defendant committing 
      a criminal health care fraud offense, the United States may file a civil 
      proceeding using the Fraud Injunction Statute, to ensure assets traceable 
      to such violation are available to repay those victims the defendant has 
      defrauded. 
    <P>Each time a civil matter is referred to a USAO it is opened as a matter 
      pending in the district. Civil health care fraud matters are referred directly 
      from federal or state investigative agencies, or result from filings by 
      private persons known as "relators," who file suits on behalf of the Federal 
      Government under the 1986 <EM>qui tam</EM> amendments to the False Claims 
      Act and may be entitled to share in the recoveries resulting from these 
      lawsuits. At the end of 1998, the USAOs had 3,471 civil health care fraud 
      matters pending. 
    <P>A matter becomes a case when the United States files a civil complaint, 
      or intervenes in a <EM>qui tam </EM>complaint, in United States District 
      Court. A large majority of civil health care fraud cases and matters are 
      settled without a complaint ever being filed. In 1998, civil health care 
      fraud cases filed increased 20 percent over 1997, from 89 to 107. 
    <P>A significant agreement in 1998 arising from a <EM>qui tam</EM> case, involved 
      Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC), the Medicare contractor for Illinois 
      and Michigan, in which the company agreed to plead guilty to eight felony 
      counts and agreed to pay a $4 million criminal fine and $140 million in 
      settlement of its liability under the federal False Claims Act. HCSC, also 
      known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, agreed to plead guilty 
      to six counts of making false statements to conceal evidence of its poor 
      performance in processing Medicare claims from HCFA, and two counts of obstructing 
      and conspiring to obstruct federal auditors. The civil settlement resolves 
      allegations that the company falsified documents and manipulated samples 
      used in government audits of the company's Medicare operations, failed to 
      process claims in accordance with guidelines established by HCFA, and failed 
      to handle beneficiary and physician inquiries in a timely manner. Prior 
      to the corporate plea, one former and one current manager at HCSC's Marion 
      office pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and obstruction 
      of a federal audit. Through their submission of false information to HCFA 
      concerning the performance of HCSC on its Medicare Part B contracts, HCSC 
      had its contracts with HCFA renewed, and received almost $1.3 million in 
      incentive payments from HCFA. In December 1997, HCSC agreed to withdraw 
      from the Medicare program and, as of September 1, 1998, was no longer a 
      Medicare contractor. This case combined efforts of the U.S. Attorney in 
      Southern Illinois, the FBI, the HHS/OIG, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, 
      the Criminal Division, and the Civil Division. <A name=m></A>

      </STRONG> 
    <P>Civil Division attorneys vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care 
      fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors General 
      of HHS and Defense, as well as other federal and state law enforcement agencies. 
      A total of 161 new health care fraud matters were initiated in 1998. In 
      addition to pursuing more health care fraud allegations, the Civil Division 
      is pursuing an increasing number of health care fraud cases in which the 
      apparent single damages are particularly high. 
    <P>A particularly significant 1998 accomplishment was the $4.7 million settlement 
      with Charter Behavioral Health Systems, a psychiatric hospital chain, to 
      resolve claims in a <EM>qui</EM> <EM>tam</EM> lawsuit. The government alleged 
      that a Charter hospital improperly billed Medicare for millions of dollars 
      of psychiatric services rendered to individuals who could not benefit from 
      the services because they had debilitating organic brain disorders, such 
      as Alzheimer's Disease and severe dementia. These beneficiaries were routinely 
      admitted to the hospital by doctors allegedly seeking to increase patient 
      admissions in response to pressure from Charter's corporate headquarters. 
      As part of the agreement, the hospital will be monitored under a 5 year 
      corporate integrity agreement, and will not bill Medicare for any services 
      for a 15- month period. 
    <P>In another health care <EM>qui tam</EM> case, $17.2 million was paid by 
      the University of Texas Health Science Center/Medical School at San Antonio 
      to settle allegations that inflated claims for physician services were submitted 
      to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the State Legalization Alien Impact Assistance 
      Grant program. The government alleged that the Medical Center submitted 
      claims for services personally provided by faculty physicians when, in fact, 
      the Center's records did not support the claim that the faculty member personally 
      provided the service. 
    <P>In addition, Invacare Corporation paid $2.6 million to the Department of 
      Veterans Affairs to settle allegations of fraud in the sale of wheelchairs. 
      Invacare allegedly failed to provide accurate and complete cost data during 
      contract negotiations and violated the Buy America Act by supplying foreign-made 
      wheelchairs. 
    <P>In 1998, the Civil Division received $3.8 million from the Account. Resources 
      were allocated primarily to fund 33 positions, including attorneys, analysts, 
      auditors, paralegals, secretaries and a litigation support specialist. Because 
      coordination across many organizations and locations is crucial to enforcement 
      efforts, one attorney served as the Civil Division's health care fraud coordinator. 
      This attorney provided guidance and information, developed training, and 
      coordinated policy development and information exchange with other DOJ components, 
      HHS/OIG, HCFA and other Government agencies and the private sector. 
    <P>Although very limited 1998 resources were available for Automated Litigation 
      Support (ALS), auditors and consultants from the Account, the Civil Division 
      was able to apply other appropriated funds for these critical services. 
      During 1998, much needed ALS was provided to 17 cases while auditor/consultant 
      support was provided to 15 cases. Four of the supported cases have settled, 
      yielding nearly $14 million. Expected recoveries in the remaining cases 
      range from several million to hundreds of millions of dollars. <A name=n></A>

    <P>Successful health care fraud enforcement cannot be achieved by any one 
      agency alone. Investigations must be a cooperative effort if they are to 
      be successful in combating the increasing problems of health care fraud. 
      The FBI is involved in this cooperative effort. The FBI works many health 
      care fraud cases on a joint basis with other federal agencies, including 
      the HHS/OIG. These two federal agencies collaborate through attendance at 
      health care fraud working groups, attend each others training conferences, 
      and have a liaison program between the two organizations. In addition, the 
      Health Care Fraud task forces represent the coordinated efforts of the FBI, 
      state and local law enforcement, investigative agencies such as Inspectors 
      General, and private industry. The FBI and HHS/OIG share a common commitment 
      to ending fragmented health care fraud enforcement. 
    <P>In addition to providing new statutory tools to combat health care fraud, 
      HIPAA specified mandatory funding to the FBI for health care fraud enforcement. 
      In 1998, $56 million was provided by HIPAA for 569 positions (340 agents). 
      The FBI used this funding, in large part, to fund an additional 44 agents 
      and 28 support positions for health care fraud and to create several new 
      dedicated Health Care Fraud Squads. This increase in personnel resources 
      along with the direct FBI funding increased the number of FBI agents addressing 
      health care fraud in the fourth quarter of 1998 to approximately 460 agents 
      as compared to 112 in 1992. 
    <P>As the FBI has increased the number of agents assigned to health care fraud 
      investigations, the caseload has increased dramatically from 591 cases in 
      1992, to 2,700 cases through 1998. The FBI caseload is divided between those 
      health plans receiving government funds and those that are privately funded. 
      Criminal health care fraud convictions resulting from FBI investigations 
      have risen from 116 in 1992, to 352 through the third quarter in 1998. 
    <P>Health care fraud investigations are among those investigations having 
      the highest priority within the FBI. The investigations are generally complex 
      and require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully investigate. 
      Often sophisticated, innovative and creative ideas are needed to combat 
      and eventually prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes. As the complexity 
      and long-term nature of health care fraud investigations increase, the FBI 
      anticipates that the number of FBI investigations and convictions will begin 
      to level off. 
    <P>A considerable portion of the increased funding was utilized to support 
      major health care fraud investigations. In addition, operational support 
      has been provided for FBI national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical 
      diversion, chiropractic fraud, and medical clinics. Further, the Health 
      Care Fraud Unit, FBI Headquarters, supported individual field offices with 
      equipment and supplies to assist in numerous individual investigations. 
    <P>In January 1998, four former executives of Damon Clinical Laboratory were 
      indicted on federal criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the Medicare 
      Program of more than $25 million. These charges are in addition to the Damon 
      Corporate plea in October 1996 when the company pled guilty to conspiracy 
      to defraud Medicare in connection with conduct alleged against these executives, 
      and paid $119 million to the United States. It is alleged that the individuals 
      conspired to manipulate the way physicians order blood tests. 
    <P>The funding made available through HIPAA also made possible 4 Regional 
      Training Conferences for FBI agents assigned to health care fraud investigations. 
      These 1 week training sessions sponsored by HCFA provided in depth training 
      on the Medicare Program to almost 250 agents. Other training made possible 
      by HIPPA included: a session for the FBI's Financial Analysts; and a joint 
      FBI, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, HHS/OIG Managers Conference. 
      Further, funding from HIPAA was utilized in Pharmaceutical Division and 
      Cost Report Training sessions to more than 100 FBI agents. <A
