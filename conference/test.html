<p><strong>MISSION:</strong> Office of Inspector General's (OIG) mission is to protect the integrity of Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) programs as well as the health and welfare of program beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong> Since its 1976 establishment, OIG has been at the forefront of the Nation's efforts to fight waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and more than 100 other HHS programs.  

<p><strong>WHAT WE DO:</strong> We carry out our mission using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach, with each of our six components playing a vital role.  A nationwide network of audits, investigations, and evaluations results in timely information as well as cost-saving or policy recommendations for decision-makers and the public. That network also assists in the development of cases for criminal, civil and administrative enforcement.  OIG develops and distributes resources to assist the health care industry in its efforts to comply with the Nation's fraud and abuse laws and to educate the public about fraudulent schemes so they can protect themselves and report suspicious activities.</p>
