<h2>Endorsement Disclaimer: Pop-Up Advertisements</h2>
<p>When visiting our website, your web browser may produce pop-up advertisements.

<h2>Information Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The information provided using this website is only intended to be general summary information to the public. It is not intended to take the place of either the written law or regulations.</p>

<h2>Intrusion Detection</h2>
<p>This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in Federal court. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify violators. </p>

<h2>Third-Party Applications</h2>
<p>There may be third-party applications and/or services embedded on this site to improve its functionality. Our integration of these products is intended to provide a seamless user experience. Where applicable, privacy policies particular to these applications are provided.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> OIG uses Twitter to send short messages (up to 140 characters)-or tweets-to share information with the public. While visitors may read the OIG Twitter feed without subscribing to it, visitors who want to subscribe to (or follow) OIG Twitter feeds must create a Twitter account at www.twitter.com. To create an account, you must provide some personal information, such as name, user name, password and email address. Visitors have the option to provide additional personal information including a short biography, location, or picture. Most information you provide for a Twitter account is available to the public, but you can modify how much of your information is visible by changing your privacy settings at the Twitter.com website. OIG staff members do not take possession of the personal information belonging to Twitter followers.  Nor do they respond to direct messages or comment.  OIG does, however, monitor the number of subscribers.</p> 
<p><strong>YouTube:</strong> HHS OIG posts videos on YouTube to make them available to the public. You do not need to register with either YouTube or Google (YouTube owner) to watch OIG videos. When visitors watch videos, YouTube may record non-personally identifiable information about its site usage, such as channels used, videos watched, and data transfer details to improve its services. If you log on to the YouTube site before watching OIG videos, YouTube may associate information about your site use with your YouTube account. If you log on to YouTube and comment on an OIG video, any personal information you included when registering for your account will be visible to visitors who click on the comment. </p>
<p><strong>GovDelivery:</strong> HHS OIG uses GovDelivery to distribute email updates to the public. GovDelivery is not government-owned or government-operated, and OIG's account with them is part of an overall account that the Department of Health & Human Services has with GovDelivery. To receive email updates from OIG, you must voluntarily provide your email address via the subscription option on the oig.hhs.gov homepage or through HHS newsletter subscription options. GovDelivery collects and maintains the list of email addresses and distributes OIG's email updates. OIG does not use email addresses for any purpose other than to distribute the email updates. </p>

<p><strong>HootSuite:</strong> HootSuite is a password-protected, third-party application that uses a series of tools to manage, track, and analyze approved OIG social media accounts. OIG does not take possession of any personal information provided by users to HootSuitewhen such users visit OIG social media platforms. The public can access OIG-specific information distributed through HootSuite by visiting OIG's individual social media accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Go.USA.gov:</strong> OIG uses Go.USA.gov to shorten long website links in external communications including social media and e-mail updates. If a member of the public clicks on a Go.USA.gov link, certain technical information about their click through will be gathered and stored. This information is the referring Internet domain (such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.) from which the user accessed the link and the date and time the user clicked on the link, and does not include any personal information provided by users to Go.USA.gov. </p>
