<h2>January 2011 Quality Control Reviews</h2>

<p>HHS OIG is committed to improving the quality of non-Federal audits. In accordance with our responsibilities for audit work performed by non-Federal auditors on Federal programs, OIG issued one QCR report in January 2011. Based on our review, we determined that the audit was acceptable with a deficiency. According to the CIGIE Guide, an audit that is acceptable with a deficiency is defined as an audit for which the audit documentation contains quality deficiencies that should be brought to the attention of the auditor (and auditee, as appropriate) for correction in future audits.</p>
