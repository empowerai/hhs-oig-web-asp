<div class="acc_container">
<div class="block">
<p> OIG auditors work with HHS management to minimize risk; assess controls to prevent fraud, waste and abuse; and conduct audits to ensure that program goals are achieved and Recovery Act funds are accurately tracked and reported. OIG work is coordinated with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and other audit and law enforcement organizations at the Federal, State, and local levels. Recovery Act activities include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> reviewing agency spending plans prepared by HHS management; </li>
  <li> outlining steps that HHS management and OMB should take to obtain meaningful Single Audit coverage; </li>
  <li> conducting risk assessments of programs receiving Recovery Act funding, including health information technology and other non-Medicaid programs; and </li>
  <li> assessing recipients&rsquo; capability to manage and account for Recovery Act funds in accordance with Federal regulations. </li>
</ul>
<p> OIG&rsquo;s completed and ongoing reviews related to the Recovery Act include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> State Medicaid Agency compliance with Recovery Act requirements; </li>
  <li> internal control reviews of the HHS grant award process; </li>
  <li> recipient capability audits of Head Start and Early Head Start grantees; </li>
  <li> health and safety reviews at Head Start grantees; </li>
  <li> State agencies&rsquo; monitoring of Children Services Block Grant program funds; and </li>
  <li> review of Recovery Act funds provided to colleges and universities, Community Action Agencies, and community health centers. </li>
</ul>Reports of completed reviews may be found at the <a href="/reports-and-publications/recovery/recovery_reports.asp">Recovery Act-related Audit and Inspection Reports</a> section of this site.</p>


<h2 class="line"><a name="quality_control"></a>Quality Control Reviews </h2>

<p>To ensure that Federal monies are being used for their intended purposes, all non-federal entities (States, local governments, colleges and universities, and nonprofit organizations) that expend $500,000 or more of Federal awards in a year are required to obtain an annual audit in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and guidance from the Office of Management and Budget.</p> 

<p>These "single audits" are a key tool used to drive accountability for Federal awards under the Recovery Act. Additionally, Offices of Inspectors General are required to perform quality control reviews (QCR) of single audits to ensure that they are properly performed and that unallowable costs and other noncompliance are fully reported. </p>

<p>These reviews are conducted in accordance with the <img class="cleanPdf" src="/images/icon_pdf.gif" alt="pdficon" />
